{"id": "768817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=768817", "title": "Amusement", "text": "Amusement\n\nAmusement, from the old French \"à muser\" – to put into a stupid stare, is the state of experiencing humorous and entertaining events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with enjoyment, happiness, laughter and pleasure. It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal.\n\nAmusement is considered an \"epistemological\" emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke. The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling.\n\nCurrent studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and sociology. In addition, the precise mechanism that causes a given element (image, sound, behavior, etc.) to be perceived as more or less 'amusing' than another, similar element to a particular individual is not clearly understood.\n\nTwo different theoretical perspectives about emotion provide contrasting origins of amusement:\n\nThe evolutionary perspective proposes that amusement is a distinct emotion that evolved to enhance a species’ survival. Collective laughter helps define an ingroup, helping people recognize those similar to them and feel included. It also helps identify outgroup members and enhance the barrier between the two. Laughter can provide network support as encouragement, or it can inform ingroup members that they are losing majority favor and to adjust their behavior to reassimilate.\n\nThe theory of constructed emotion suggests that when humans have a positive experience that increases their arousal, such as a faster heartbeat and increased sweat production, they cognitively seek out a label for that feeling. They will land on amusement if that experience resembles other amusement experiences they have had.\n\nThe origin of the study of emotional expression is often attributed to Charles Darwin. In 1872, Darwin published his book \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\", in which he extensively describes his observations of how people and animals display emotions on their faces and through sound. Darwin comments on amusement as an emotion of great joy during which a person is likely to laugh. He also notes that across all peoples humans can laugh until they are panting and tears roll down their cheeks. In the 1960s, Paul Ekman, an American psychologist, revived the study of emotional expression, proposing, like Darwin, that emotions were universally recognizable. His early work focused on six basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise. By the 1990s, Ekman had expanded this list to include several additional emotions, one of which was amusement. \n\nDisplays of amusement have been distinguished from related emotions like embarrassment and shame. More recent studies have confirmed that laughter is a distinct signal of amusement and is recognizable across cultures.\n\nAn amused facial expression typically has these characteristics:\n\nThe expression of amusement is usually accompanied by genuine laughter. The experience of laughter changes the breathing pattern and often causes all the muscles to relax.\n\nAs a positive, high arousal emotion, amusement falls in the same category as excitement and exhilaration. These emotions are highly valued in American culture where positive feelings that high in energy are seen as ideal. In contrast, East Asian cultures value positive, low arousal emotions such as contentment, calm and peacefulness.\n\nEmotion regulation is the term for how people attempt to influence - increasing, decreasing, maintaining or changing - how, when, and where they experience emotion. Through changing how they think about a target of amusement, like a humorous video clip, people are able to increase and decrease how much amusement they feel, express in smiles and laughs, and experience in their bodies (e.g. increased heart rate and respiration). Choosing to increase or prolong experiences of positive emotion is one way in which people can learn to cope when faced with challenges and develop resilience.\n\nAs a positive emotion, amusement contributes to the development of resilience in both children and adults. Positive emotions help people build social resources that foster their ability to cope during hard times. Increases in resilience lead to higher life satisfaction and general happiness. \n\nRapidly growing in popularity, laughter therapy, or humor therapy, focuses on promoting laughter as a therapeutic tool. Usually implemented in a group, laughter therapy uses a variety of gag jokes like red noses and magic tricks to encourage laughter - fake or real. Laughter causes the bodies' muscles to relax which increases blood flow and oxygen intake. Proposed benefits include: Stress management, relaxation, improved mental functions, improved digestion and pain relief. Some suggest that laughter activates similar brain wave frequencies as a meditative state. However, scientific studies of these benefits are limited and have methodological issues.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13582676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13582676", "title": "Bottle service", "text": "Bottle service\n\nBottle service is the sale of liquor by the bottle in mostly American lounges and nightclubs.\n\nThe purchase of bottle service typically includes a reserved table for the patron's party and mixers of the patron's choice. Bottle service can include the service of a VIP host, who will ensure that patrons have sufficient mixers and will often make drinks using the patrons' liquor bottle and mixers. The purchase of bottle service sometimes results in cover charge being waived for the purchaser's party and often allows patrons to bypass entrance lines. The tip is also often included in the price.\n\nThe cost of a bottle at such a lounge or club is usually significantly marked up, often by 1000% or more, and can account for a significant portion of an establishment's revenue.\n\nEarly forms of bottle service existed in World War II era Japan, where unfinished bottles would be stored. In its modern form, an early example was in 1988 at the Paris nightclub Les Bains Douches, bottle service was introduced to deal with an excess of customer demand. An early, inexpensive form of bottle service ($90, compared with $6 drinks) was established at the Tunnel in New York City in 1993 (by Jeffrey Jah and Mark Baker). The modern form of bottle service was pioneered in 1995 by Michael Ault at Spy Bar and in 1996, Chaos ($175 for a bottle of Stolichnaya vodka), with the goal of creating a \"barrier to entry\", rather than of increasing liquor sales.\n\nThe concept later spread to other American cities, notably Miami and Las Vegas in the early 2000s.\n\nThe cost of bottle service and the central position provided to purchasers of bottle service has led some critics to complain that bottle service is turning night clubs into elitist dens. Preferential treatment for purchasers of bottle service may include stopping the regular dance music when an especially expensive bottle is purchased and, instead, playing a theme song, or removing patrons from a table to make way for another patron and their party that purchased bottle service.\n\n"}
{"id": "5980866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5980866", "title": "Butlins Redcoats", "text": "Butlins Redcoats\n\nRedcoat is the name given to frontline staff at Butlins holiday camps in the UK. A Redcoat has duties ranging from adult entertainer or children's entertainer to stewarding.\n\nThe first Redcoat was Norman Bradford. When Sir Billy Butlin opened his first Butlins in Skegness he realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned, most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlins atmosphere was born.\n\nThe same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Norman, and the role of Redcoat was formed.\n\nTo make his new army stand out, Butlin asked Norman to purchase a uniform. Norman later returned with a jacket in the camp colours of, blue, primrose yellow and white; however, Butlin found the look to be too authoritarian and decided they should wear red blazers with white lapels and the Redcoat uniform was born. The first uniforms were made by Billie Ditchfield who became one of the first two female Redcoats (the other was Kay Berry).\n\nOver the years the uniform has changed several times, but has always retained the core component of a red blazer (despite a proposal to replace them with red jumpsuits in the 1970s). In the 1960s and 1970s, braid and badges were added to the blazers. Famous designers such as Jeff Banks and Zandra Rhodes have redesigned the uniforms. To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of Red Blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters \"BHC\" on (standing for \"Butlins Holiday Camps\") and white trousers or skirt. This uniform was worn throughout 2011 for the anniversary celebration, and from early 2016 it has once again become the permanent redcoat uniform.\n\nThe Redcoats undergo a tough selection process. Despite this they are still paid only minimum wage and members of the 'triple threat' cast team (such as the skyline gang) are paid more. Recruitment roadshows are held nationally on a yearly basis. In these Roadshows Prospective Redcoats have to show customer service and guest facing skills (contrary to the popular belief that they need to be able to sing and dance, which is no longer the case).\n\nIn 1999 Butlins Introduced the now defunct Butlins 'Academies of Excellence' to train Redcoats. However, this has since been replaced with a 6 week training course. There is also the option of a foundation degree in either musical theatre, or Technical Skills for the Arts and Leisure Industry Training includes aspects of direction and production and time spent as a Butlins Redcoat counts toward membership of Equity.\n\nRedcoats work in three areas, General duties, the Kid's Club and the costume character team. General duties are similar to those of a tour rep in a resort – Butlins even describe the role as \"The Original Holiday Rep\" In the evening the Redcoats form part of the live entertainment team, starring in Gangshows and \"X-Factor\" style game shows. Throughout the years, Redcoats have been expected to lead ballroom dances, stage and judge competitions, and steward theatrical performances as well as meeting and greeting guests in public areas. Redcoats run the children's clubs which provide sporting activities, competitions and arts and crafts. Each redcoat will have many different roles to fulfil in any given week.\n\nButlins remained the largest holiday camp chain in the UK, but smaller camps copied the redcoat style of staffing. In the 1960s, Fred Pontin adopted the Bluecoat to represent at Pontins holiday camps, and at some point, Harry Warner decided Warners' holiday camps should adopt the Greencoat.\n\nThe ITV series \"Redcoats\" was a docusoap following the lives of Redcoats at Butlins Minehead and Bognor resorts. Over three series of 30-minute episodes, it shows the selection process, the Redcoats entertaining the visitors and life behind the scenes. The series was made by Pilgrim Productions.\n\nThe BBC television series \"Hi-de-Hi!\", written by former Butlins employees Jimmy Perry (a Redcoat) and David Croft (summer show actor), featured the Yellowcoats as a fictional analogue. The title of the show \"Hi-de-Hi\" originated with Norman Bradford who claimed to have taken it from an American film; he began using this as a cheer to which the audience spontaneously responded \"Ho-de-ho\".\n\nAnother BBC television series, \"Doctor Who\", featured an episode entitled \"Delta and the Bannermen\", which depicted an alien attack on the fictitious Shangri-La holiday camp (in reality the Butlins camp at Barry Island). As with the real camp, Shangri-La was staffed with Redcoats played by extras.\n\nA number of entertainers have been Redcoats in the early stages of their careers. Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the Equity trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; Stephen Mulhern notably performed on the Royal Variety Performance in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat, and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. Clinton Ford, for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with \"Old Shep\" just after completing his final summer season at Pwllheli. However, prior to this in 1957 Russ Hamilton recorded a number 2 hit in the UK \"We Will Make Love\" (held off the top spot by Elvis Presley and \"All Shook Up\"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song \"Rainbow\", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record \"We Will Make Love\" for the benefit of Butlins guests.\n\nOther artists have gone on to find success building on the skills they learned as a Redcoat, such as Des O'Connor, Jimmy Tarbuck, and Michael Barrymore. The role is an important part of the entertainment and tourism culture of the United Kingdom, and even today former Redcoats are regularly identified in the press and in books by this role even though it may only have been a small part of their career.\n\nOther famous Redcoats include Ted Rogers, a comedian best known as the presenter of the variety/game show \"3-2-1\", and Northern Irish entertainer Jimmy Cricket.\n\n"}

The series deals with solved or cold criminal cases, often related to well-known murders and serial crimes. Many early episodes relate to Australian cases (e.g. Port Arthur or the Snowtown murders), although notable crimes from the UK and the USA are increasingly featured, and cases from Canada, France, Guyana, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, and Ukraine have also been included. Unlike a number of similar podcasts, the series is scripted and narrative, relying primarily on original police or mass-media documents, eyewitness accounts, and interview or public announcement recordings. Larger and more-complex cases, such as The Yorkshire Ripper, The Moors Murders, and The East Area Rapist, have received multiple-week serialised broadcasts, and case updates to previously aired cases are also provided from time to time. The series has been well received, and has won a number of awards since its debut, including Best of 2016 (iTunes).\n\nThe podcast first aired on 9 January 2016 and was conceived by an anonymous Australian host who started producing the show in 2015 in his spare room. The host had just had surgery and was listening to a lot of podcasts and true-crime shows (e.g. \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", \"Hardcore History\", \"Serial\" and \"Making A Murderer)\" at the time, and was encouraged by Joe Rogan to make his own based on in-depth research and a storytelling style. According to one source, the host remains anonymous because \"he wants the stories, facts, and questions speak for themselves\" and \"It makes the show about the stories and that's it.\" According to another review, the podcast's:deliberately sparse production value became its strongest asset, plunging listeners into a pool of ambient silence with a host neither named nor contextualized. ... the podcast does not go the typical route of parading listeners through a montage of primary source material like evening news reports or interviews with now-wizened investigators; instead, the stories are unfolded slowly and methodically by the anonymous host, with just enough editorializing to make it feel like a friend or a witness is relaying the tale.In its current format, the 2018 \"Casefile\" team now consists of two researcher/writers, two composers, a designer, and the host/narrator. It has also had a producer, Mike Migas, “since about episode 7”, which led to episodes 1–6 being reworked. Researchers have also travelled internationally to access primary resources in some cases, such as former researcher and co-writer Anna Priestland, who travelled from Melbourne to visit the national archives in Kew in 2017 to examine police files on Myra Hindley. A number of the more recent international cases have also been written and researched by the Australian author Eileen Ormsby. \n\nEach case includes a corresponding page on the podcast's official homepage, which details information such as special thank yous, official support phone numbers and websites (for Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand), other credits, and resources (such as books, websites, videos, documents, articles, maps, wanted posters, and suspect sketches), as in this example. Warnings are regularly given at the start of podcasts due to the graphic content. It is available via numerous sites. One episode, Case 55 (Simone Strobel, released 15 July 2017), has been removed due to legal issues, although general details of the case itself are publicly available.\n\nAlong with the recent rise in true crime podcasting, as seen in Serial or S-Town, the series has been reviewed positively by several sources:\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" (22 July 2016):As \"Casefile\" points out in their tagline, fact is scarier than fiction. But what the podcast might really prove is that fact is \"even scarier\" when told in a thick Australian accent – especially when accompanied by ambient, pulsing noise from a trio of professional sound designers and musicians. In each weekly episode, which can run anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, the narrator... calmly tells a story of a devastating Australian crime. The podcast expertly covers murder and abduction, sometimes walking the listener through the criminal's trial, and other times discussing potential theories for a crime whose perpetrator was never caught.\"Evening Standard\" (28 March 2017):The Australian-made show, which launched in January last year, has regularly featured in the UK’s top 10 podcasts on iTunes in recent months. It also regularly reaches the top 50 in the US chart, rising as high as fourth last July. ... Its mini-series on Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe received 5.8 million downloads — the most for a single case since the launch. Its most popular single episode was on British tourist Peter Falconio ... [which] has more than 4.2 million downloads. A series covering the Moors Murders ... had more than a million downloads in four days.Download statistics by iTunesChart.net state that Casefile has charted in the top 100 in 4 regions, with peak ranking positions of the podcast including: Australia (1), Canada (9), United Kingdom (14), and United States (7). In Australia, the podcast has consistently been in the top 10 since May 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

The films mainly focus on Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif), a notorious serial killer known as the \"Lakeshore Strangler\" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a voodoo ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to Hell. The original film, \"Child’s Play\", was released on November9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million. It also won a Saturn Award for Best Horror Franchise.\n\nThe film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment \"Child’s Play\", which appears to have more psychological horror elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of dark humor. As the films progressed, they became satirical and campy, until the series briefly became a horror comedy, with 1998's \"Bride of Chucky\" and 2004's \"Seed of Chucky\". In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title \"Curse of Chucky\" and be released direct-to-video. Unlike \"Bride\" and \"Seed\", \"Curse of Chucky\" is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since \"Bride of Chucky\", titles have no longer been released under the \"Child's Play\" brand name and now use \"Chucky\" and will continue to do so with future films. The latest installment to the series, titled \"Cult of Chucky\", was released on October3, 2017.\n\nSeveral short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of \"Seed of Chucky\", a short film entitled \"Chucky's Vacation Slides\", set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled \"Chucky Invades\" was released in the run-up to the release of \"Curse of Chucky\". On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on \"Saturday Night Live\", with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of World Championship Wrestling's \"Monday Nitro\" program as a heel, taunting wrestler Rick Steiner who was a face at the time and promoting \"Bride of Chucky\".\n\n\"Child’s Play\" is the first and only in the series to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists (until \"Seed of Chucky\" which is distributed by Rogue) before the franchise was sold by Universal Pictures. The film is directed by Tom Holland, written by Holland, John Lafia, and Don Mancini, and starring Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, Alex Vincent, and Brad Dourif. The film was released on November 9, 1988. Set in 1988, a serial killer and voodoo practitioner named Charles Lee \"Chucky\" Ray is mortally wounded and transfers his soul via a voodoo ritual into a child-sized \"Good Guy\" doll. The doll is found by a homeless peddler and sold to Karen Barclay, who gives it to her son Andy as a birthday gift. As time goes on Chucky has to get his soul out of the doll before it turns human and the transfer becomes permanent, and thus has to possess the first person he told his secret to - Andy. Desperate to leave his doll body, Chucky terrorizes the Barclays in order to restore his soul.\n\n\"Child’s Play 2\" is the second film in the series and the first film distributed by Universal Pictures. The film is directed by John Lafia, written by Mancini, Vincent and Dourif reprise their roles as Andy Barclay and the voice of Chucky. The film was released on November 9, 1990. The movie takes place in 1990, two years after the events of the first film. While Andy is living in foster care, the doll's manufacturer has taken a positive corporate stance and remade it to prove there is nothing wrong with the Good Guy brand. After a freak electrical malfunction brings Chucky back to life in a new Good Guy doll, he continues to follow Andy in order to transfer his soul from his doll body before it will once again becomes his permanent form.\n\n\"Child's Play 3\", also known as \"Child’s Play 3: Look Who’s Stalking!\", is the third film in the series, and the last film to be titled as \"Child's Play\", before the title change as \"Chucky\". The film is directed by Jack Bender, written by Mancini, and had Dourif reprise once again his role as Chucky, Alex Vincent replaced as Andy Barclay by Justin Whalin as an older version of Andy and a supporting cast of Perrey Reeves and Jeremy Sylvers. The film was released on August 20, 1991. Set in 1998, eight years after the events of the second film, the Good Guy factory has re-opened after the negative publicity, and as Chucky's remains are removed, some blood from his destroyed human-doll body drips into a vat of melted plastic used to re-mould the Good Guy line. Chucky returns in a new body, going on a hunt for the now 16-year-old Andy Barclay, who has left to attend a military academy after the results of the first two films. While attempting to reach Andy, Chucky finds a new boy, Ronald Tyler, who he shares his \"secret\" with. With a new \"Good Guy\" doll body brings the possibility of possessing a new human body, Chucky attempts to restore his soul to human form through Tyler as Andy attempts to stop the killer Good Guy doll once and for all.\n\nThe film picks up a month after the events of \"Child's Play 3\". Unlike the first three films, this film focuses entirely on Chucky and Tiffany. Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend and his accomplice, Tiffany, acquires Chucky's remains, stitches them together and via a voodoo ritual revives Charles Lee Ray, albeit in a much different form. Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now dead Tiffany and attacks a detective. No one knows whether the detective is dead or alive as the screen cuts to black and closing credits roll.\n\n\"Seed of Chucky\" is the fifth installment, and the first film other than the original \"Child's Play\" not to be distributed by Universal Pictures. Chucky and Tiffany's child Glen finds his parents six years later, in 2004, and brings them back to life, but is horrified by their murders. Chucky and Tiffany force a pregnancy on actress Jennifer Tilly, which is accelerated by voodoo magic. Glen suffers a split personality disorder, having both a male and female soul in his/her body, and dismembers his father. Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own. In an epilogue set five years later, in 2009, one of Chucky's severed arms is mailed to the home of his family, where it attacks the now-human Glen.\n\n\"Curse of Chucky\" is the first direct-to-video film in the series. In 2013, Nine years after the events of the fifth film and four years after its epilogue, Chucky is delivered to the family home of Nica and Sarah Pierce, where Chucky terrorizes and kills the family one by one. Chucky is driven by revenge, as Sarah was the one who called the police on him while he was still human, leading to his original death in the first film by detective Mike Norris. Nica survives, but is institutionalized, and blamed for the murders. Chucky is collected by Tiffany, who delivers him to Alice. Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's body which will be explained in Cult of Chucky, as he does the soul ritual the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying. Six months later, Chucky is mailed to his next victim, who just so happens to be none other than his longtime original nemesis from the original first three films, Andy Barclay, who points a shotgun at Chucky and shoots him through the head.\n\nIn 2017, Four years after \"Curse of Chucky\", Chucky returns to terrorize Nica at the mental institution where she is admitted. Chucky goes on yet another murderous rampage, killing disbelieved employees & tenants at the institution with various dramatic tricks. When a now vigilante Andy Barclay figures out Chucky's plan, he breaks into the institution in an attempt to disarm his newly created voodoo plot. But in the end, Nica ends up being possessed by Chucky, which causes her to gain the ability to walk and leaves with Tiffany.\n\nIn July 2018, \"Collider\" reported that a modern-day version of \"Child's Play\", a reboot, is in development at MGM without the involvement of Mancini or Kirschner. Lars Klevberg will direct the film, with a script from Tyler Burton Smith (of \"Polaroid\" and \"Quantum Break\" fame, respectively). David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith will serve as producers. The plot will reportedly feature a group of kids, similar to \"Stranger Things\", and a hi-tech version of the Good Guy Doll. Production will begin in September, later that year.\n\nLater, in September 2018, Gabriel Bateman, Aubrey Plaza and Brian Tyree Henry were cast as Andy Barclay, and Karen Barclay, and Detective Mike Norris, respectively.\n\nIn October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from \"Seed of Chucky\" return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from \"Cult of Chucky\". In February 2018, it was announced that a \"Child's Play\" television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc. Mancini also stated that following the TV show, feature films will continue to be developed in the future.\n\nIn an interview with \"Bloody Disgusting\" Mancini discussed the potential of a \"Child's Play\" film set on a train as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise, tentatively referred to as \"Child’s Play on Elm Street\".<br>\n\nI would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act,\" he explains. \"I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up? \n\nIn September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as \"cool and doable\", confirming that the film would be titled \"Child’s Play on Elm Street\" and that he was currently in discussion with New Line Cinema about the film. The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in \"Bride of Chucky\", in which Freddy Krueger's bladed glove had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.\n\nIn February 2018, it was announced that a television series titled \"Child's Play: The TV Series\", is in development with involvement from franchise creator Don Mancini, and producer David Kirschner. The show will share continuity with the original film series, and be a continuation of that story. Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed. By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee \"Chucky\" Ray.\n\nOn the home media DVD and Blu-ray release of \"Seed of Chucky\" in 2005, a short film entitled \"Chucky's Vacation Slides\" was included in the special features. The short, set during the events of \"Seed of Chucky\", follows Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen after having returned from a family vacation. The film implies that the events of \"Seed of Chucky\" take place over the course of 5–10 years. While browsing through their photographs of their vacation on a slide projector, Tiffany notices various corpses in the background of certain photographs, realizing that Chucky has been killing people again. Tiffany leaves, with a distraught and sickened Glen, while Chucky continues to view the photographs. After a delivery man arrives with a pizza, Chucky leads him to his garage and kills him off-screen. Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly and Billy Boyd all reprise their roles from the films.\n\nLeading up to the DVD release of \"Curse of Chucky\" in 2013, a series of short film videos were released. The clips showed Chucky interrupting the events of several other horror films. Brad Dourif and Edan Gross reprised their roles as Chucky and the Good Guy Doll, respectively. \n\n\n\nJoe Renzetti composed the first \"Child’s Play\", followed by Graeme Revell, who composed the soundtrack for \"Child’s Play 2\" and \"Bride of Chucky\". John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios wrote the score for \"Child’s Play 3\", while Pino Donaggio composed \"Seed of Chucky\". Joseph LoDuca composed the score for \"Curse of Chucky\" and \"Cult of Chucky\".\n\nThe following crimes have been associated with the \"Child’s Play\" films:\n\nIn December 1992 four people who tortured and killed 16-year-old Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the \"Child's Play\" movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (\"Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)\" by 150 Volts, featuring samples from the movie \"Child's Play\".\n\nIn 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named James Bulger were said to have been influenced by the film \"Child’s Play 3\". The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor James Ferman.\n\nAccording to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including \"Chucky\" films, from the age of about six or seven. Elena Lobacheva, a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film \"Bride of Chucky\", which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout Moscow.\n\nBeginning in 1992, Innovation Publishing released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of \"Child’s Play 2\". It was later collected in a trade paperback. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled \"Child’s Play: The Series\", ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of \"Child’s Play 3\".\n\nIn 2007, Devil's Due Publishing obtained the license to publish \"Child's Play\" comics and released a one-shot crossover with Hack/Slash titled \"Hack/Slash vs. Chucky\" which takes place after the events of the \"Seed of Chucky\" film. This was followed by a four-issue series called \"Chucky\". A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.\n\nSlimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled \"Chucky: Slash & Dash\". The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships & Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet \"Child’s Play\" video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.\n\nIn the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.\n\nThe app was released on November 1, 2013.\n\nSince 1992, Chucky has starred in his own shows at Universal Studios \"Halloween Horror Nights\", entitled, \"Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults\" and \"Chucky's Insult Emporium\".\n\nIn 2009, the climax of \"Child’s Play 3\" received its own maze, entitled \"Chucky's Fun House\". \"Curse of Chucky\" has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.\n\nIn 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, and Jason Voorhees.\n\n"}

{"id": "6231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6231", "title": "Comic book", "text": "Comic book\n\nA comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan, comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\n\nThe largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at (), with annual sales of 1.9billion manga books/magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15issues per person). The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at in 2016. , the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.\n\nComic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.\n\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing Dell Publishing's 36-page \"Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics\" as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered the Golden Age of Comics. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero.According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.\n\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today. The Silver Age of comic books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\n\nA notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's criticisms of the medium in his book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which prompted the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comix. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order.\n\nFrank Stack's \"The Adventures of Jesus\", published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comic; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on \"Zap Comix\" popularized the form.\n\nThe rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series \"Star Reach\", published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\", which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably \"RAW\") represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, , and Fantagraphics - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Comics, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\n\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\". Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators devised the paperback \"comics novel\" \"Blackmark\". Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" in 1978.\n\nIn 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.\n\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title. Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15. New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased \"Motion Picture Funnies Weekly\" #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\n\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD , including two examples of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\n\nUpdating the above price obtained for \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy. \n\nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. , there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.\n\nThe first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as , , and , these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book , an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the . Published in thousands of copies, the \"kibyōshi\" may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain extant.\n\nModern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term \"manga\" means \"random (or whimsical) pictures\", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's \"Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women\" (1798). During the Meiji period, the term \"Akahon\" was also common.\n\nWestern artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in \"ukiyo-e\", as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as \"Ponchi-e\" (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart \"Punch\" magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or four-picture format.\n\nDr. Osamu Tezuka (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the \"ukiyo-e\" tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.\n\nThough a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.\n\nManga magazines—also known as \"anthologies\"—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain one-shot comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for many years if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called , the equivalent of the American trade paperbacks. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.\n\n, fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\n\nKorean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the Korean Wave. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwaga have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\n\n \nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called \"BDs\" (an abbreviation of \"bande dessinées\") in French and \"strips\" in Dutch. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics, but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name \"bande dessinée\" derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as \"le neuvième art\" (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\nAlthough \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. \"The Guardian\" refers to Ally Sloper as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.” British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and \"Varney the Vampire\"). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”\nThe two most popular British comic books, \"The Beano\" and \"The Dandy\", were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in British popular culture during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: “When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s - and through really to the 1950s and 60s - these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\" The “world’s naughtiest schoolboy”, \"Dennis the Menace\" was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for \"The Beano\" soar. He features in the cover of \"The Beano\", with the BBC referring to him as the “definitive naughty boy of the comic world.” \n\nIn 1954, \"Tiger\" comics introduced \"Roy of the Rovers\", the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as \"Eagle\", \"Valiant\", \"Warrior\", \"Viz\" and \"2000 AD\" also flourished. Some comics, such as \"Judge Dredd\" and other \"2000 AD\" titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably \"Oz\" and \"Escape Magazine\".\n\nThe content of \"Action\", another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\" serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.\n\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his \"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\", \"Watchmen\", \"Marvelman\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; Neil Gaiman with \"The Sandman\" mythos and \"Books of Magic\"; Warren Ellis, creator of \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"Planetary\"; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of \"Wanted\" and \"Kick-Ass\". The comic book series \"Hellblazer\", which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\n\nAt Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages \"The Broons\" and \"Oor Wullie\" strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\n\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series. The collection featured \"The Beano\", \"The Dandy\", \"Eagle\", \"The Topper\", \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Bunty\", \"Buster\", \"Valiant\", \"Twinkle\" and \"2000 AD\".\n\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as \"fumetti\") made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as \"Diabolik\" or the \"Bonelli\" line—namely \"Tex Willer\" or \"Dylan Dog\"—remain best-sellers.\n\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's \"Corto Maltese\".\n\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the U.S. Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\n\n\"Čtyřlístek\" (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.\n\nDistribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\" #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\n\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.\n\nMany libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.\n\nThe largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named \"Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!\" by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Editora, and it measures at 69.9 cm by 99.8 cm (2 ft 3.51 in by 3 ft 3.29 in).\n\nThe Japanese manga author Eiichiro Oda has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His widely popular comic titled One Piece was first serialised in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4305591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4305591", "title": "Cup-and-ball", "text": "Cup-and-ball\n\nCup-and-ball (or ball in a cup) or ring and pin is a traditional children's toy. It is generally a wooden handle, to which a small ball is attached by a string, and which has one or two cups, or a spike, upon which the player tries to catch the ball. It is popular in Spanish-speaking countries, where it is called by a wide number of names (including boliche in Spain and balero in most of Hispanic America), and was historically popular in France as the bilboquet. A similar toy with three cups and a spike called \"kendama\" is very popular in Japan and has spread globally in popularity.\n\nThe game was created in the 14th century and has been improved in different ways since then.\n\nIn North America it was both a child's toy and a gambling mechanism for adults, and involved catching a ring rather than a ball. In some Native American tribes it was even a courtship device, where suitors would challenge the objects of their interest to a polite game of ring and pin. The Mohave variant of the game included up to 17 extra rings attached to the cord, and game scoring involved differing point values assigned to different rings. Other variants include those played by the Inuit of what is now Labrador, with a rabbit's skull in place of the ball, with extra holes bored into it, which had to be caught on the handle like a skewer; and those that used balls of grass or animal hair. Ring and pin games in general were known as \"ajagak, ayagak, ajaquktuk\" in Inuit dialects.\n\nThe cup-and-ball is noted in France as early as the sixteenth century. The game was played by King Henry III of France as historical records note, though his playing was considered evidence of his mental instability. After his death, the game went out of fashion, and for a century the game was only remembered by a small number of enthusiasts such as the Marquis de Biévre.\n\nThe game had its golden age during the reign of Louis XV — among the upper classes people owned baleros made of ivory. Actors also sometimes appeared with them in scenes. The game was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Jean-Jacques Rousseau mentions the game early in his \"Confessions\" when stating his reservations about idle talk and hands, saying \"If ever I went back into society I should carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket, and play with it all day long to excuse myself from speaking when I had nothing to say.\"\n\nThe game is very popular in the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora, often known as boliche. The name varies across many countries — in El Salvador and Guatemala it is called capirucho; in Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico it is called balero; in Spain it is boliche; in Portugal and Brazil it is called bilboquê; in Chile it is emboque; in Colombia it is called coca; and in Venezuela the game is called perinola.\n\nIn 1960, American lexicographer Charles Keilus (1919-1997) documented the term \"zingo paya\" for a cup-and-ball game in Tijuana, Mexico, and formed the Zingo Paya Society in Los Angeles to promote the toy and its collection.\n\nThis game was also popular in England during the early 19th century, as Jane Austen is reputed to have excelled while entertaining her brother's son in a game called \"Bilbo Catcher\".\n\nThere is one picture at the National Portrait Gallery of a young girl playing the game. It appears to be a copy of a painting from Philip Mercier although the original painting has not been found. Unlike other 18th century toys, which are found repeatedly in artwork, cup and ball games are rare with only two known pictures, one copied from the other.\n\nThe game of kendama is believed to have arrived in Japan in the 18th century, and the game underwent significant modernization and standardization in the early 20th century, becoming internationally popular in the 21st century.\n\nIn 2011, a German company, TicToys, began to create a toy with the name Ticayo. Yomega, an American company which is famous for their Yo-yos and Kendamas, began to sell Ticayos, in which they popularized the said toy.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to get the ball into the cup. While the concept is very easy, mastering the game can sometimes be challenging.\n\nThere are several styles of gameplay in the Latin world such as \"la simple\", \"la doble\", \"la vertical\", \"la mariquita\".\n"}
{"id": "47786614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47786614", "title": "Devilman", "text": "Devilman\n\nDevilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. The most notable is Tomoharu Katsumata's 1973 feature film \"Mazinger Z vs. Devilman\", which features Devilman teaming up with Nagai's titular robot to fight Dr. Hell.\n\nAkira Fudo is a timid teenage boy who lives with Miki Makimura and her family after his parents died on a trip to the Arctic. One day, Akira's best friend, Ryo Asuka, asks for help when his archaeologist father died after uncovering a mask during an excavation of ancient Mayan ruins, confirming the existence of ancient apex predators that assimilate other lifeforms to evolve: demons. The mask is revealed to be a fossilized demon skull that shows the wearer the world as it was many millennia ago when demons roam the Earth. Ryo's plan is to prevent the revival of demons: \"To fight a demon, one must become a demon.\"\n\nRyo believes that people like Akira with a pure heart may be able to harness a demon's powers without being consumed and Akira agrees to help after they encounter demons in Ryo's house. Ryo takes his friend to a nightclub in his father’s basement then picks a fight and draws blood to attract demonic attention. Demons begin to possess the clubbers and threaten Ryo and Akira, until a powerful demon known as Amon – the Lord of War, also called the Beast of Hell – consumes Akira. But Akira manages to retain his sense of self while possessing some Amon's personality traits and power as he becomes known as Devilman. Throughout the series, Devilman has many battles with the demon hordes, encountering foes such as Amon's harpy-like lover Sirène, the water demon Geruma, and a large turtle-demon Jinmen who incorporates the souls of his victims into his shell.\n\nEventually, the demons start a world war with humanity which causes mass panic and paranoia across the planet with mankind turning on itself. Akira starts to gather other Devilmen like him to fight the demons, only to be betrayed by when Ryo exposed him to the public which resulted in Miki's parents arrested by the government while she and her brother were violently murdered by a mob which Akira slaughtered in retribution. It was then that Ryo reveals himself as the reincarnation of the fallen angel Satan, having unconsciously orchestrated his true plan while exploiting humanity's flaws and fell in love with Akira as he arranged his transition into Devilman. With no one left to protect, Akira ends his friendship with Satan as they eventually settle things in an epic battle lasting twenty years after humanity is extinct.\n\nDuring the final battle, Satan reveals to Akira that the demons were unintentionally created by God and that he defied the order to kill them out of deeming that they have a right to live. Satan convinced the demons to enter a state of hibernation in the ice to conserve their strength for the final battle with God, awakening to find Earth ravaged by humanity which he resolved to exterminate first. It was then that Satan realizes his actions made him and the demons were no better than God, learning too late that he already killed Akira when asking for his forgiveness. The series ends with the Devilman army defeated, which Satan weeping for the loss off his dearest love as an army of angels appear in the distance to wipe out the remains of Satan's army.\n\n\"Devilman\" evolved from Go Nagai's previous manga, \"Demon Lord Dante\", after Toei Animation approached Nagai about turning \"Dante\" into a television series. The producers wanted certain elements toned down, and a more human-like anti-hero created. \"Devilman\" was born as a result of this. Go Nagai worked on the anime's scenario along with renowned screenwriter and science-fiction novelist Masaki Tsuji, who wrote the scripts for 35 of the TV series' 39 episodes. Along with the television series, \"Devilman\" was also produced as a serialized manga in \"Shōnen Magazine\" beginning in 1972. Go Nagai designed the manga to be more horror-like and mature than the anime version. \n\nNagai designed \"Devilman\" as an anti-war work; the fusion of humans and demons is an analogy for the draft, and Miki's violent death parallels the death of peace. \"There is no justice in war, any war,\" wrote Nagai, \"nor is there any justification for human beings killing one another. \"Devilman\" carries a message of warning, as we step toward a bright future.\"\n\nThe manga was originally published by Kodansha from to in \"Shōnen Magazine\". The series has been published in \"tankōbon\" format several times, most of them by Kodansha. Starting with the 1987 publishing, most Kodansha editions include \"Shin Devilman\", which originally was not meant to be included in the canon of the original series, as a part of the volumes.<ref name=\"Shin Devilman - d/visual\"></ref> The manga has been translated into English in a series of five bilingual manga volumes published by Kodansha.\n\nThe manga has also been published along with \"Cutie Honey\" in the magazine published by JIVE during 2004 in order to take advantage of the release of the live-action films of both series.\n\nA one-shot, which is not originally part of \"Shin Devilman\", but that has always been compiled along with the series in \"tankōbon\", was published in the magazine \"Variety\" by Kadokawa Shoten. This 16-page story does not have any text and it presents the moments of Akira after the death of Miki in the original series, but before the battle with Satan, as he buries the remains of Miki and encounters Ryo.\n\nSeven Seas Entertainment announced the publication of the original manga for 2018. \n\nThe anime television series was 39 episodes long and ran from to on NET (now TV Asahi). Outside Japan, the TV series was broadcast in Italy in 1983 and enjoyed great popularity there. A DVD box set of the series was released in Japan on September 21, 2002. The TV series has been licensed for the first time in North America by Discotek Media who released the series on DVD in 2014.\n\n was released in by King Records. It was followed by , released in by Bandai Visual. Kazuo Komatsubara, an animation director on the original TV series, was the character designer for the OVAs, which were animated by his Oh Production.\n\nBoth were directed by Umanosuke Iida (credited under his birth name, Tsutomu Iida) and were closely developed in conjunction with Nagai himself. The OVAs' plot revolves around Akira's transformation into Devilman up until his battle with Sirène. Besides a few minor alterations, the OVAs are faithful to the original manga. Both OVAs were released on Laserdisc and on a single DVD by Bandai Visual in . The two OVAs were also the only \"Devilman\" anime to have been commercially released in the United States (by Manga Entertainment) prior to 2014. The DVD release included only the English-dubbed version (the original Japanese version was previously released on VHS in 1995 by L.A. Hero and Dark Image Entertainment).\n\nIn 2000, \"\" was released as a pay-per-view event in Japan and was later released on video and DVD. It covers the period between the humans becoming aware of demons and the semi-final battle between Devilman and Amon. The battle between Devilman and Satan does not occur in this OVA.\n\nIn 2015, \"Cyborg 009 VS Devilman\" was released. The 3-episode OVA features Devilman battling the cast of Shotaro Ishinomori's \"Cyborg 009\".\n\nA 10-episode original net animation adaptation produced by Science Saru and directed by Masaaki Yuasa, titled \"Devilman Crybaby\", was released worldwide on January 5, 2018 exclusively on Netflix.\n\n\"Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman\" is a crossover animated film between \"Devilman\" and \"Mazinger Z\" produced by Toei and released in . The movie features alternative versions of the events from both series, and is therefore not canonical to either one.\n\nIn , a live-action tokusatsu film directed by Hiroyuki Nasu was theatrically released in Japan. The film starred Hisato Izaki as Devilman, Yūsuke Izaki as Ryo Asuka and Ayana Sakai as Miki Makimura. The cast also included AV Idol Maria Yumeno.\n\nA large number of soundtrack albums have been released since the beginning of the original series.\n\nThree novels have been released. The first one was written by Go Nagai's brother Yasutaka Nagai with illustrations by Go. It was originally published in 1981 by Asahi Sonorama in four books. It is not related to the manga \"Shin Devilman\", from which some chapters were also written by Yasutaka. With the release of the first OVA, in 1987 a single volume novel based on it was released by Kodansha titled . It was also written by Yasutaka Nagai, but it had illustrations by the OVA's main designer, Kazuo Komatsubara. In 1999 a second novelization of 4 volumes titled was published by MediaWorks and once again written by Yasutaka and illustrated by Go. All three series of novels are unrelated to each other even though all were written by Yasutaka Nagai.\n\nA video game based on \"Devilman\" was released for the Famicom by Namco on . Bandai also released a game based on \"Devilman\" for the Sony PlayStation and Windows 98 on . Along with several of Nagai's other creations, Devilman appeared in the Japanese Super Famicom game .\n\nDevilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. Miki is the first female protagonist of the 1974 manga \"Oira Sukeban\", and Akira has appeared in various incarnations of \"Cutie Honey\", most notably the 1994 OVA \"New Cutie Honey\". Miki and Ryo Asuka also appear as dogs (with dog-like bodies and human heads) in the \"Violence Jack\" manga. In 1997, Nagai created \"Devil Lady\", based on his idea of if the main character was a woman. The \"Devil Lady\" series contains its own original story that stands out from the \"Devilman\" series. Fudo's silhouette briefly appears in the opening credits of \"Devil Lady\". The cast of \"Devilman\" also crossed over with characters from \"Mazinger Z\" and \"Violence Jack\" in the 1991 OVA \"CB Chara Nagai Go World\". This release featured the familiar characters in comical and lighthearted antics in super deformed forms. In this series, it is revealed that Violence Jack is a future version of Akira Fudo. It is also revealed that Miki is an otaku and that she knew of Akira's identity as Devilman due to reading the manga offscreen.\n\nGo Nagai created the manga \"Devilman Saga\" (デビルマンサーガ) in 2014 which is said to conclude the Devilman trilogy. It is published in Shogakukan's \"Big Comic\".The story takes place in the year 2025, a roboticist named Fudou Yuuki joins a project involving a large mural depicting humanity's true past as well as the ancient but advanced technology found in Antarctica.\n\nThe manga has sold over 50 million copies as of March 2017. \n\nThe storyline in \"Devilman\" made it stand apart from other manga of the time. However, its controversial violence made it a major target of protest for the PTA and other groups.\n\nGo Nagai is said to have been highly shocked that his giant-robot work \"Mazinger Z\", which was on Japanese TV at the same time as \"Devilman\" and which he originally did not take very seriously, surpassed \"Devilman\" in popularity. The reason was that he had worked especially hard on \"Devilman\" and only made \"Mazinger\" as a way to blow off steam.\n\nDevilman was ranked fifth in Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth who commented that \"Shonen manga developed a dark tone with Devilman's graphic violence, casual blasphemy, and theme of using evil itself to fight evil.\" A character designer from SNK admitted that \"Devilman\" was an influence in designing Kyo Kusanagi.\n\nJason Huff of The Anime Review Notes \"a couple of enjoyable bits\" in the OVA adaptation, yet ultimately recommends Vampire Hunter D instead \"if you want to see a splatterfest of grotesque monsters getting all gooey and split in two\", . Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements of The Anime Encyclopedia said that the series was brought down by \"the messy confluence of Japanese and European mythology\". Though comments about the series and statements making incorrect claims on the series, make it seem as if they never read it.\n\n"}
{"id": "6083658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6083658", "title": "Disney Fairies", "text": "Disney Fairies\n\nDisney Fairies is a Disney franchise created in 2005. The franchise is built around the character of Tinker Bell from Walt Disney's 1953 animated film \"Peter Pan\", subsequently adopted as a mascot for the company. In addition to the fictional fairy character created by J. M. Barrie, the franchise introduces many new characters, and expands substantially upon the limited information the author gave about the fairies and their home of Never Land. The characters are referred to within stories as \"Never Land fairies\". The franchise includes children's books and other merchandise, a web site, and the computer-animated \"Tinker Bell\" film series, featuring the character and several of the Disney fairies as supporting and recurring characters.\n\nIn Barrie's 1902 novel \"The Little White Bird\", in which he introduced the mythos of Peter Pan and the fairies, he wrote, \"When the first baby laughed for the first time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping about. That was the beginning of fairies.\" The \"Disney Fairies\" are based on a similar idea: every time a newborn baby laughs for the first time, that laugh travels out into the world, and those that make their way to Neverland turn into a Never fairy.\n\nThe fairies generally reside in the Home Tree, a towering, massive tree located in the very heart of Pixie Hollow in Neverland. Various groups of fairies work and live nearby as well. Most of the fairy characters are young and female, but older, taller, and male fairy characters are also included. The males are sometimes referred to as \"sparrow men\", though the term \"fairies\" is used to refer to both female and male fairy characters.\n\n\n\nThere are several key characters that are not Never Fairies.\n\n\nSome of Tink's book-only best friends who also may appear in a crossover special with the Fairies in the movies and with other shows:\n\n\nFawn, Iridessa, Queen Clarion, Rosetta, Silvermist, Sweetpea, Terence, and Vidia were from the books, as well. They are the only fairies from the books to appear in the movies. Sweetpea only appears in \"The Pirate Fairy\" (the sixth movie).\n\nThere is a set of supernumerary fairies, appearing a few times in the Chapter books\n\n\nOthers include:\n\nThere is a set of key Never Mermaids:\n\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide transferred the Disney Fairies franchise main publishing license to Little, Brown Books for Young Readers in January 2014 except for the \"Never Girls\" series starting in February. This roll out will included nine titles, including leveled readers, storybooks, a Passport to Reading title, a sticker book, and a board book. Brown planned on introduction a new character, Croc, in the board book to allow the line appeal to younger readers, including some boys. Additional, Brown's plan includes greater connection to the Peter Pan story, pirates and Never Land. Five of the books tie into the April 1st video release The Pirate Fairy.\n\nAt the opening of the 2005 Bologna International Children's Book Fair, the Walt Disney Company revealed its plan to introduce a children’s illustrated novel for girls 6–10 years of age.\nDisney Fairies debuted September 2005, when Disney Publishing Worldwide unveiled the novel \"Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg\", written by Newbery Honor-winning author Gail Carson Levine with a US$1 million marketing and publicity campaign and a virtual world. It was released in 45 countries and 32 languages and became a New York Times bestseller and has already sold over 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe story begins in Fairy Haven/Pixie Hollow, located in the heart of Neverland. Prilla, who is a brand-new fairy, born of a baby's laugh, arrives in Neverland and discovers that she has no talent for any of the fairy avocations. Tinker Bell takes Prilla to see Mother Dove, but before the wise bird can advise Prilla, Neverland is shaken by a terrible hurricane. Mother Dove is thrown off her nest, and her precious egg, which holds all the secrets of Neverland, is shattered. Immediately, all those who live in Neverland begin to age. The island's only hope is for some brave fairies to take the egg pieces to Kyto the dragon and ask him to restore it with his fiery breath.\n\nThe book was followed in 2007 by a sequel, entitled \"Fairy Haven and the Quest for the Wand\". Another sequel, \"Fairies and the Quest for Neverland\", was released in 2010.\n\nIn the Year of a Million Dreams celebration, book stores released a form submitting a fairy character. The winner is said to be put in his/her own fairy's book.\n\nRandom House has published a series of chapter books starting soon after the release of the first novel under the banner \"Tales of Pixie Hollow\".\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2006, Egmont Magazines launched a new monthly magazine for girls for 5–9 years old, produced by The Walt Disney Company Italia, S.p.A. and published in Italy a couple of months prior to the Egmont translations. The magazine, entitled \"Fairies\", began with an initial print of 110,000 copies and a cover price of £1.99. The magazine's content is centered on Tinker Bell, and her fairy friends from the Pixie Hollow. Each issue features a collectable pull-out story, games, puzzles, posters and colouring pages. \"Fairies\" Magazine has been launched in Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, Poland, Russia, Spain, the Nordic countries, Portugal, Germany, and Benelux.\n\nIn January 2013, PDW launched \"Never Girls\" chapter book series extension of the Disney Fairies franchise under publishing partner Random House's Stepping Stone imprint. The Never Girls chapter series reached the New York Times Bestsellers List - Children's Series on the week of August 10. Random House retained publication of this line despite the move of the franchise's general move to Little, Brown in February 2014.\n\nIn addition to the Published work, The Walt Disney Company provides support for the Disney Fairies across all business units. The campaign includes The Disney Fairies Website, where visitors can explore and discover information about the Disney Fairies. The website allows users to learn about the fairies, create a fairy, visit the Pixie Hollow, and explore related merchandise.\n\nDisney Consumer Products have also produced a line of dolls and role play assortments. The first Disney Fairies Products were a series of 10-inch dolls, which were a Disney store exclusive in January 2006. Since then, Playmates Toys Inc teamed up with Disney in October 2005 to design and produce a line of toys for the Disney Fairies, which will include 3.5\" small dolls, 8\" fashion dolls, playsets & activity sets with DVDs and collectible story cards. \"Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg\" was the inspiration for the line of toys. Disney Consumer Products launched a wide variety of Disney Fairies branded items, consisting of everything from apparel to stationery.\n\nA series of ten postage stamps were issued by Japan Post in 2006. Each stamp has a face value of 80 JPY, and they were distributed in a hardcover case, including some information about the Fairies. The stamps could be ordered at some post offices in Japan, and were for domestic addresses.\n\nA long-running series of 3D computer-animated films featuring Tinker Bell has been releasing since 2008. Produced by DisneyToon Studios, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, the series consists of six direct-to-video films and one TV special.\n\nIn October 2008, two \"Pixie Hollow\" locations opened at Disney Parks. One opened at Disneyland near the Matterhorn in the area where Ariel's Grotto was formerly located, and the other at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Mickey's Toontown Fair. Another version opened at Hong Kong Disneyland on January 21, 2011 as one of the festivities to celebrate the park's 5th anniversary. At these \"Pixie Hollow\" locations, guests have the opportunity to meet and greet Tinker Bell and other fairies, Silvermist, Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Terence, Vidia, and arriving in October 2012, Periwinkle, from the franchise, as well as dine with them.\n\nThe Magic Kingdom location closed in February 2011 as part of the ongoing Fantasyland expansion. A larger \"Pixie Hollow\" area was included in the original plans for the expansion, but they have since been abandoned. On July 28, 2011, Tinkerbell and her fairy friends returned to the Magic Kingdom in \"Tinkerbell's Magical Nook\", located at the Adventureland Veranda. But in 2014, it was closed, and Tinker Bell has moved to Town Square Theater where she can greet guests alone.\n\nPixie Hollow was an MMOG created by The Walt Disney Company and released September 8, 2008. The game was free to play online, however a subscription was needed to have access to things for members only. The website was based partly on the Disney fairy books written by Gail Carson Levine. Free-members could create a female Fairy or male Sparrow Man avatar who each came with a small selection of furnishings to decorate a virtual room. Players were able to interact with others and have access to both 'speed' chat with pre-selected phrases and full chat where they are able to type their own messages. They could also play various \"Talent Games,\" or fairy themed mini-games, found in the various meadows and forests of Pixie Hollow. The game used organic materials as a virtual currency for players to shop. Players could also play games and visit places to earn badges that they could see in their \"leaf journal,\" which also served as a handbook and inventory. Players could purchase a monthly, semi-annual or annual membership. The membership included: Clothing, furniture, access to the ballroom, and a hair salon with spa.\n\nYou could also purchase Pixie Diamonds. Members were granted an allowance of Pixie Diamonds, (once a month.) People who were not members were able to buy clothing, but they had to use Pixie Diamonds. Members In January 2012, \"Pixie Diamonds\" were introduced, an in-game currency that could be purchased with real-world money and used to buy or upgrade items without an active membership. Though the website was geared towards young girls, on April 22, 2010, the game introduced a male character named Slate; he was referred to as a \"Sparrow Man\" rather than a male fairy.\n\nOn August 20, 2013, it was announced that Pixie Hollow would be closing on September 19, 2013. All the fairies were given unlimited access to the world until the closing date.\n\n\"Jake and the Never Land Pirates\" has featured Tink in \"Jake's Never Land Rescue\", \"Battle for the Book\" and \"Jake's Awesome Surprise\".\n\nTo date, two of the characters from the Disney Fairies franchise have appeared in ABC's fantasy drama series \"Once Upon a Time\". Tinker Bell appears as a recurring character played by Rose McIver and debuts in the third episode of Season Three. Silvermist appeared in the spin-off \"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland\" in the second episode of Season One where she is played by Jordana Largy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17966467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17966467", "title": "Elegiac comedy", "text": "Elegiac comedy\n\nElegiac comedy was a genre of medieval Latin literature—or drama—which survives as a collection of about twenty texts written in the 12th and 13th centuries in the liberal arts schools of west central France (roughly the Loire Valley). Though commonly identified in manuscripts as \"comoedia\", modern scholars often reject their status as comedy. Unlike Classical comedy, they were written in elegiac couplets. Denying their true comedic nature, Edmond Faral called them Latin \"fabliaux\", after the later Old French \"fabliaux\", and Ian Thomson labelled them Latin comic tales. Other scholars have invented terms like verse tales, rhymed monologues, epic comedies, and Horatian comedies to describe them. The Latin \"comedies\", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the \"fabliaux\" but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive romances, student juvenilia, didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes.\n\nSome elegiac comedies were adapted into vernacular language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Gower. The poem \"Pamphilus\" has Venetian and Old French versions.\n\nThese comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; lyric complaints only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the Greek \"new comedy\" practised by Terence and Plautus, but the greatest influence on them was Ovid. His \"Ars amatoria\", \"Amores\", and \"Heroides\" were highly influential. Plautus, though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the Scholastic debates concerning the nature of universals and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end.\n\nThe elegiac dramatists delight in \"showing off\" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their \"fools\" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. Parody is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its satiric effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants’ attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats’ attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy.\n\nThe comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire.\n\nThe elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that \"no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.\" A similar opinion is that the comedies are rhetorical exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. John of Garland wrote \"all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.\" Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. Arnulf of Orléans, one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.\n\n\n"}

In films that were meant to be shown with an intermission, there was frequently a specially recorded \"entr'acte\" on the soundtrack between the first and second half of the film, although this practice has died out in recent years.\n\nOriginally \"entr'actes\" resulted from stage curtains being closed for set or costume changes: to fill time as not to halt the dramatic action, to make a transition from the mood of one act to the next, or to prevent the public from becoming restless. In front of the closed curtains, the action could be continued during these \"entr'actes\", albeit involving only players with no scenery other than the curtain, and a minimum of props.\n\nAn \"entr'acte\" can take the action from one part of a large-scale drama to the next by completing the missing links. The Spanish Sainete often performed a similar function.\n\nIn traditional theatre, incidental music could also bridge the 'closed curtain' periods: ballet, opera and drama each have a rich tradition of such musical interludes. The literal meaning of the German word, \"\" refers to its original function – \"change music\". Eventually, \"entr'actes\" (or \"intermezzi\") would develop into a separate genre of short theatrical realizations (often with a plot completely independent from the main piece), that could be produced with a minimum of requisites during intermissions of other elaborate theatre pieces. These later \"entr'actes\" were distinctly intended to \"break\" the action or mood with something different, such as comedy or dance. Such pieces also allowed the chief players of the main piece to have a break. Eventually the idea of being an insert into a greater whole became looser: \"interlude\" sometimes has no other connotation than a \"short play\".\n\nWhen the insert was intended only to shift the mood before returning to the main action, without a change of scene being necessary, authors could revert to a \"play within a play\" technique, or have some accidental guests in a ballroom perform a dance, etc. In this case the insert is a \"divertimento\" (the term is Italian; the French \"divertissement\" is also used) rather than an \"entr'acte\".\n\nIn the French opera tradition of the end of the 17th century and early 18th century (Jean-Philippe Rameau, for example) such \"divertissements\" would become compulsory in the form of an inserted ballet passage, a tradition that continued until well into the 19th century. This was eventually parodied by Jacques Offenbach: for example, the cancan ending \"Orpheus in the Underworld\".\n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, a \"divertimento\" had become a separate genre of light music as well. These \"divertimenti\" could be used as interludes in stage works, many of the \"divertimenti\" composed in the last half of the 18th century appears to have lost the relation to the theatre, the music in character only having to be a \"diversion\" in one or another way.\n\nSome more or less elaborate and/or independent \"entr'actes\" or \"intermezzi\" became famous in their own right, in some cases eclipsing the theatre productions for which they were originally written:\n\n"}

Depending on the medium, the executive producer may be concerned with management accounting or associated with legal issues (like copyrights or royalties). In films, the executive producer generally contributes to the film's budget and usually does not work on set, in contrast to most other producers.\n\nIn films, executive producers finance the film or participate in the creative effort, but do not work on the set. Their responsibilities vary from funding or attracting investors into the movie project to legal, scripting, marketing, advisory and supervising capacities.\n\nThe crediting of executive producers in the film industry has risen over time. In the mid-to-late 1990s, there were an average of just under two executive producers per film. In 2000, the number jumped to 2.5 (more than the number of standard \"producers\"). In 2013, there were an average of 4.4 executive producers per film, compared with 3.2 producers.\n\nIn television, an executive producer usually supervises the creative content and the financial aspects of a production. Some writers, like Stephen J. Cannell, Tina Fey, and Ryan Murphy, have worked as both the creator and the producer of the same TV show. In case of multiple executive producers on a TV show, the one outranking the others is called the showrunner, or the leading executive producer.\n\nIn recorded music, record labels distinguish between an executive producer and a record producer. The executive producer is responsible for business decisions and more recently, organizing the recordings along with the music producer, whereas the record producer produces the music. Sometimes the executive producer organises the recording and selects recording-related crew, such as sound engineers and session musicians.\n\nIn the video game industry, the title \"executive producer\" is not well-defined. It may refer to an external producer working for the publisher, who works with the developers. \n\nFor example, in 2012, Jay-Z was announced as executive producer for NBA 2K13. His role consisted of appearing in an introduction, picking songs for the game's soundtrack and contributing to the design of its in-game menus \"and other visual elements\".\n\nAn executive radio producer helps create, develop, and implement strategies to improve product and ratings.\n\n\n"}

The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much humorous derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to \"fire fart\", one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter.\n\nIn 1999 author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades, but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury. Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or fraternity houses. With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as YouTube. The people appearing in the videos are predominantly young males. In his book \"The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life\" author Mark Richard Leary explains how a great deal of unhappiness is due to people's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior and that \"stupid stunts\", including lighting flatulence, were a way to make an impression and be included in group bonding or hazing.\n\nAlthough there is little scientific discourse on the combustive properties of flatus, there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in comic routines, movies, and television; including cartoons. In \"Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa\" author Neil Slaven quotes Frank Zappa for calling fart lighting \"The manly art of fart-burning\", and another book quotes the musician Kenny Williams for saying that it demonstrates \"compression, ignition, combustion and exhaust.\"\n\nThere have been documented cases of flatulence during surgery being inadvertently ignited causing patient injury and the risk of death.\n\nThe composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of gases with the following six as major components:\n\nMethane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue hue (ΔH = −891 kJ/mol), as:\n\nHydrogen sulfide also combusts (ΔH = −519 kJ/mol) to\n\nThe odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, skatole, indole, volatile amines and short-chain fatty acids. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.\n\nSome of the gases are produced by bacteria which live in symbiosis within the large intestines of humans and other mammals. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's digestion of food into relatively simpler substances. The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by aerophagy, while the CO component results from the reaction of stomach acids (HCl) with pancreatic bile (NaHCO).\n\n\n"}

Saint Augustine in \"City of God (De Civitate Dei)\" (14.24) mentions some performers who did have \"such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing.\" Juan Luis Vives, in his 1522 commentary to Augustine's work, testifies to having himself witnessed such a feat, a remark referenced by Michel de Montaigne in an essay.\n\nThe professional farters of medieval Ireland were called braigetoír. They are listed together with other performers and musicians in the 12th century \"Tech Midchúarda\", a diagram of the banqueting hall of Tara. As entertainers, these braigetoir ranked at the lower end of a scale headed by bards, fili, and harpers.\n\nOne late medieval flatulist is mentioned in an entry in the 13th-century English \"Liber Feodorum\" or \"Book of Fees\". It lists one Roland the Farter, who held Hemingstone manor in the county of Suffolk, for which he was obliged to perform \"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum\" (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) annually at the court of King Henry II every Christmas. The \"Activa Vita\" character in the 14th century allegorical poem Piers Plowman appears to number farting among the abilities desirable in a good entertainer in general, alongside storytelling, fiddling, or playing the harp. This poem translates to \"As for me, I can neither drum nor trumpet, nor tell jokes, nor fart amusingly at parties, nor play the harp.\"\n\nIn Japan, during the Edo period, flatulists were known as \"heppiri otoko\" (放屁男), lit. \"farting men.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "659824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659824", "title": "Frame story", "text": "Frame story\n\nA frame story (also known as a frame tale or frame narrative) is a literary technique that sometimes serves as a companion piece to a story within a story, whereby an introductory or main narrative is presented, at least in part, for the purpose of setting the stage either for a more emphasized second narrative or for a set of shorter stories. The frame story leads readers from a first story into another, smaller one (or several ones) within it. The frame story may also be used to allow readers to understand a part of the story, then jump to another part that can now be understood. This is not however, to be mixed up with a narrative structure or character personality change.\n\nSome of the earliest known frame stories are those from ancient Egypt, including one found in the Papyrus Westcar, the \"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor\", and \"The Eloquent Peasant\". Other early examples are from Indian literature, including the Sanskrit epics \"Mahabharata\", \"Ramayana\", \"Panchatantra\", Syntipas's \"The Seven Wise Masters\", and the fable collections \"Hitopadesha\" and \"Vikram and The Vampire\". This form gradually spread west through the centuries and became popular, giving rise to such classic frame tale collections as the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"), \"The Decameron\", and \"Canterbury Tales\". This format had flexibility in that various narrators could retain the stories they liked or understood, while dropping ones they didn't and adding new ones they heard from other places. This occurred particularly with \"One Thousand and One Nights\", where different versions over the centuries have included different stories.\n\nThe use of a frame story in which a single narrative is set in the context of the telling of a story is also a technique with a long history, dating back at least to the beginning section of the \"Odyssey\", in which the narrator Odysseus tells of his wandering in the court of King Alcinous.\n\nThis literary device acts as a convenient conceit for the organization of a set of smaller narratives, which are either of the devising of the author or taken from a previous stock of popular tales, slightly altered by the author for the purpose of the longer narrative. Sometimes a story within the main narrative can be used to sum up or encapsulate some aspect of the framing story, in which case it is referred to in literary criticism by the French term \"mise en abyme\".\n\nA typical example of a frame story is \"One Thousand and One Nights\", in which the character Shahrazad narrates a set of fairy tales to the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Shahrazad's tales are also frame stories, such as \"Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman\", a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.\n\nExtensive use of this device is found in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", where the stories nest several deep, to allow the inclusion of many different tales in one work. Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\" uses this literary device to tell the story of Heathcliff and Catherine, along with the subplots. Her sister Anne also uses this device in her epistolary novel \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\". The main heroine's diary is framed by the narrator's story and letters.\n\nMary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\" is another good example of a book with multiple framed narratives. In the book, Robert Walton writes letters to his sister describing the story told to him by Victor Frankenstein; Frankenstein's story contains the creature's story; the creature's story even briefly contains the story of a family among whom it had been living.\n\nFrame stories have also appeared in other media, such as comic books. Neil Gaiman's comic book series \"The Sandman\" featured a story arc called \"Worlds End\" which consisted of frame stories, and sometimes even featured stories within stories within stories.\n\nFrame stories are often organized as a gathering of people in one place for the exchange of stories. Each character tells his or her tale, and the frame tale progresses in that manner. Historically famous frame stories include Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", about a group of pilgrims who tell stories on their journey to Canterbury; and Boccaccio's \"Decameron\" about a group of young aristocrats escaping the Black Death in the countryside and spending the time telling stories.\nSometimes only one storyteller exists, and in this case there might be different levels of distance between the reader and author. In this mode, the frame tale can become more fuzzy. In Washington Irving's \"Sketch Book\", which contains \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle\" among others, the conceit is that the author of the book is not Irving, but a certain gentleman named Crayon. Here the frame includes the world of the imagined Crayon, his stories, and the possible reader who is assumed to play along and \"know\" who Crayon is.\n\nDonald Westlake's short story \"No Story\" is a parody of frame stories, in which a series of narrators start to tell stories, each of which contains a narrator who starts to tell a story, culminating in a narrator who announces that there will be no story. Essentially, it is a frame story without a story to be framed.\n\nWhen there is a single story, the frame story is used for other purposes – chiefly to position the reader's attitude toward the tale. One common one is to draw attention to the narrator's unreliability. By explicitly making the narrator a character within the frame story, the writer distances him or herself from the narrator; she or he may also characterize the narrator to cast doubt on the narrator's truthfulness. In P. G. Wodehouse's stories of Mr Mulliner, Mulliner is made a fly fisherman in order to cast doubt on the outrageous stories he tells. The movie \"Amadeus\" is framed as a story an old Antonio Salieri tells to a young priest, because the movie is based more on stories Salieri told about Mozart than on historical fact. \n\nAnother use is a form of procatalepsis, where the writer puts the readers' possible reactions to the story in the characters listening to it. In \"The Princess Bride\" the frame of a grandfather reading the story to his reluctant grandson puts the cynical reaction a viewer might have to the romantic fairytale into the story in the grandson's persona, and helps defuse it. This is the use when the frame tells a story that lacks a strong narrative hook in its opening; the narrator can engage the reader's interest by telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand later actions, thereby identifying the reader's wondering whether the story is worth reading to the listeners'. Such an approach was used by Edith Wharton in her novella Ethan Frome, in which a nameless narrator hears from many characters in the town of Starkfield about the main character Ethan's story.\n\nA specialized form of the frame is a dream vision, where the narrator claims to have gone to sleep, dreamed the events of the story, and then awoken to tell the tale. In medieval Europe, this was a common device, used to indicate that the events included are fictional; Geoffrey Chaucer used it in \"The Book of the Duchess\", \"The House of Fame\", \"Parlement of Foules\", and \"The Legend of Good Women\" (the last also containing a multi-story frame story within the dream). In modern usage, it is sometimes used in works of fantasy as a means toward suspension of disbelief about the marvels depicted in the story. J.R.R. Tolkien, in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\" complained of such devices as unwillingness to treat the genre seriously. Lewis Carroll's \"Alice\" stories (\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\") includes such a frame, but unlike most usages, the stories themselves use dream-like logic and sequences; most dream frames frame stories that appear exactly as if occurring in real life. The writer John Bunyan used a dream device in the Christian allegory Pilgrim's Progress and its sequel, explaining that they were dreams he had while he was in prison and felt God wanted him to write down. This worked because it made what might have been seen as a fantasy something more realistic and meaningful to others who believed as he did.\n\nStill, even when the story proceeds realistically, the dream frame casts doubt on the events. In the book, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the events really occur; the dream frame added for the movie detracts from the validity of the fantasy.\n\nAs with all literary conceits, the frame tale has many variations, some clearly within the confines of the conceit, some on the border, and some pushing the boundaries of understanding. The main goal of a frame tale is as a conceit which can adequately collect otherwise disparate tales. It has been mostly replaced, in modern literature, by the short story collection or anthology absent of any authorial conceit and other rhetorical devices.\n\nTo be a frame narrative, the story must act primarily as an occasion for the telling of other stories. If the framing narrative has primary or equal interest, then it is not usually a frame narrative. For example, Odysseus narrates much of the \"Odyssey\" to the Phaeacians, but, even though this recollection forms a great part of the poem, the events after and before the interpolated recollection are of greater interest than the memory.\n\nAnother notable example that plays with frame narrative is the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump\". Most of the film is narrated by Forrest to various companions on the park bench. However, in the last fifth or so of the film, Forrest gets up and leaves the bench, and we follow him as he meets with Jenny and her son. This final segment suddenly has no narrator unlike the rest of the film that came before it, but is instead told through Forrest and Jenny's dialogues.\n\nThis approach is also demonstrated in the 2008 film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (adapted from the 2005 novel \"Q & A\"), about a poor street kid Jamal coming close to winning \"Kaun Banega Crorepati\" (the Indian version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\") and then being suspected of cheating. Most of the story is narrated at a police station by Jamal, who narrates how he knew the answers to the questions as the show is played back on video. The show itself then serves as another framing device, as Jamal sees flashbacks of his past as each question is asked. The last portion of the film then unfolds without any narrator.\n\nJoseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" demonstrates a narrator telling a story, while the protagonist is quoted so as to give the framed appearance that he is telling the story. The narrator provides the transition to the one speaking the story.\n\nA famous literary example is Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\", whereby we learn events through a visitor to the house of the title, who in turn has been told these events by the housekeeper of the Linton family. None of the main characters ever directly narrates.\n\nAnother example is David Mitchell's 2004 novel Cloud Atlas, which is a frame story inside a frame story inside a frame story – and so on. There are six stories in all, each framed inside the other, forming a chiastic structure to a semi-cathartic tale spanning centuries of narrative.\n\nFrame stories are found in many role-playing video games, such as the early \"Dragon Quest IV\", released in 1990. This literary device can also be sparingly used to achieve secondary ends. For instance, the \"Shining Force\" series of role playing games use narrators within frame stories to implement things like starting, saving and exiting the game without breaking the fourth wall entirely, or rather by constructing a second fourth wall to shield the player from having to suspend his/her disbelief as much. A similar approach was used in the open world video game \"\", where the game's missions are presented as a series of flashbacks narrated by Tommy Angelo, as he confesses his involvement with an American Mafia family. Another example of frame stories in video games is the game Catherine. Catherine's first scene is a frame story.\n\nIn the game \"Bastion\", the Kid's actions are narrated by one of the other characters, Rucks, as he tells the Kid's story to another character while the Kid is in the final area. Because Rucks never learns about the Kid's actions explicitly, the narration is mostly anecdotal and primarily serves to fill in background information about each level; however, it also serves to keep the fourth wall intact, as player deaths are portrayed as jokes on the narrator's part. After the player's actions catch up to the story, the narration switches to a more speculative tone, as Rucks no longer knows what the player is doing.\n\nAnother example is \"Persona 5\", which begins \"in medias res\" and is largely framed around Sae Niijima's interrogation of the protagonist, henceforth referred to by his code name \"Joker\" since the character's proper name is player-defined. During the story, Niijima introduces the audience to antagonists the Phantom Thieves have targeted, and whenever a Confidant besides Niijima (who cuts a deal with Joker during the interrogation) or the Velvet Room residents is unlocked, she will press Joker for information on accomplices and skills. Whenever a new party member is introduced, Niijima will press Joker on how he knew them, reacting with horror at the point in the game when her younger sister Makoto becomes a Phantom Thief. Should the player fail to complete a Palace by its deadline, the resulting game over is framed as a truth serum overdose Joker is suffering from preventing him from recalling events correctly and a mysterious man - heavily implied and later confirmed to be a traitor to the Phantom Thieves - murdering him in cold blood while Niijima leaves to allow him to recover. Conversely, a more minor memory problem caused by the truth serum overdose is used to avoid revealing the traitor's identity too early. The device is dropped once the in-game calendar reaches the day of the interrogation, as the prologue leads into the interrogation and the main conflict is still far from resolved by this date.\n\nIn musical sonata form or rondo, a theme occurs at the beginning and end of the work, or returns periodically. This could most simply be a recurrence or restatement of a melody or song. For example, the Beatles song \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" works as a framing device for their album of the same name, appearing at the beginning and end of the album. Other albums with similar devices include Paul McCartney & Wings' \"Band on the Run\", the recurring heartbeats in Pink Floyd's album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" and \"Wish You Were Here\" (\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\"), Supertramp's \"Crime of the Century\" (the harmonica riff at the beginning of \"School\" is reprised at the end of the title track), and Spirit's \"Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus\" (\"You have the world at your fingertips/No one can make it better than you\"). Another is Junior Senior's 'D-D-D-Don't Stop The Beat' album which ends with a reprise of the first notes from the opening track. The closing track of Genesis' \"Selling England by the Pound\" is a reprise of the opening track \"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight.\"\n\nA reprise may be expressed in narrative: at the beginning and the end of the movie \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Clint Eastwood's character shoots the noose to save his partner from hanging.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1992 movie \"Far and Away\", the father \"dies\" and then returns to life briefly. The same thing happens in \"Vanilla Sky\" where Tom Cruise's character \"dies\" and then comes back to life.\n\nFraming devices may also take the form of a recurrent element that appears at the beginning and the end of the narrative. For example, a story may begin with a character visiting a park under one set of circumstances, then returning at the end to the same park under a different set of circumstances, having undergone a change that allows him or her to see the park in a new light.\nA framing device might also simply be a defining image of the narrative or art that is used at the beginning and end of the work. \n\nAn example of this is in the film \"Chariots of Fire\" which begins and ends with the characters running along a beach, accompanied at both times by the movie’s famous theme music. This scene, although chronologically occurring in the middle of the film and unimportant to the straightforward plot, serves to convey a defining emotion and tone that sets the context for the main story.\n\n"}

People of all ages and backgrounds engage in humor, but the way they use it can vary greatly. Although humor styles can vary slightly depending on the situation, they tend to be a relatively stable personality characteristic among individuals. That is, individuals are fairly consistent in the ways they use humor over time.\n\nThe Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) has emerged as a robust model for understanding the individual differences in humor styles. Humor can be used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationship with others. Humor can be relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental (either to the self or others). The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating. Some styles of humor promote health and well-being, while other styles can be potentially detrimental to mental and physical health.\n\nThe Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed by Rod Martin and Patricia Doris (2003) to measure individual differences in styles of humor. Humor has been shown to be a personality characteristic that remains relatively stable over time. Humor is sometimes viewed as a one-dimensional trait. However, individuals seem to differ in the ways in which they use humor in their everyday lives, and different styles of humor seem to have different outcomes. The Humor Styles Questionnaire was developed to identify the ways in which individuals differ in humor styles and how these differences influence health, well-being, relationships, and other outcomes.\n\nThe Humor Styles Questionnaire is a 32-item self-report inventory used to identify how individuals use humor in their lives. Participants respond to the degree to which they agree with each statement (e.g., \"I enjoy making people laugh\") on a scale from 1 (\"totally disagree\") to 7 (\"totally agree\"). The questionnaire measures two main factors in humor. The first factor measures whether humor is used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationships with others. The second factor measures whether the humor is relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental and destructive. The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating.\n\nAffiliative humor is defined as the style of humor used to enhance one's relationships with others in a benevolent, positive manner. This style of humor is typically used in a benevolent, self-accepting way. Individuals high in this dimension often use humor as a way to charm and amuse others, ease tension among others, and improve relationships. They are often spontaneous in their joke telling, frequently participate in witty banter, and enjoy laughing with others. Affiliative humor is similar to self-defeating humor because both styles of humor enhance the relationships with others. However, unlike self-defeating humor, affiliative humor is not used at one's own expense.\n\nA number of outcomes are associated with the use of affiliative humor. Individuals who report high levels of affiliative humor are more likely to initiate friendships. In an organizational setting, affiliative humor has been shown to increase group cohesiveness and promote creativity in the workplace. Affiliative humor is also associated with increased levels of (explicit) self-esteem, psychological well-being, emotional stability, and social intimacy. They are also more likely to exhibit higher levels of implicit self-esteem (independently of their level of explicit self-esteem).\n\nThis style of humor is associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety. Individuals who use affiliative humor tend to have higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience as personality characteristics.\n\nExamples of items targeting affiliative humor on the HSQ include:\n\nSelf-enhancing humor is a style of humor related to having a good-natured attitude toward life, having the ability to laugh at yourself, your circumstances and the idiosyncrasies of life in constructive, non-detrimental manner. It is used by individuals to enhance the self in a benevolent, positive manner. This type of humor is best understood as a type of coping or emotion-regulating humor in which individuals use humor to look on the bright side of a bad situation, find the silver lining or maintain a positive attitude even in trying times.\n\nSelf-enhancing humor is associated with a number of personality variables as well as psychological, physical and health-related outcomes. Individuals who engage more in the self-enhancing humor style are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. In an organizational setting, self-enhancing humor has been shown to promote creativity and reduce stress in the workplace. The self-enhancing style of humor has also been shown to be related to increased levels of self-esteem, optimism, and psychological well-being, as well as decreased levels of depression and anxiety. Individuals who use the self-enhancing humor style are more likely to exhibit extraversion and openness to experience as personality characteristics and less likely to exhibit neuroticism.\n\nExamples of self-enhancing humor on the HSQ include:\n\nAggressive humor is a style of humor that is potentially detrimental towards others. This type of humor is characterized by the use of sarcasm, put-downs, teasing, criticism, ridicule, and other types of humor used at the expense of others. Aggressive humor often disregards the impact it might have on others. Prejudices such as racism and sexism are considered to be the aggressive style of humor. This type of humor may at times seem like playful fun, but sometimes the underlying intent is to harm or belittle others. Aggressive humor is related to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness.\n\nIndividuals who exhibit higher levels of aggressive humor tend to score higher on measures of hostility and general aggression. Males tend to use aggressive humor more often than women.\n\nExamples of aggressive humor on the HSQ might include:\n\nSelf-defeating humor is the style of humor characterized by the use of potentially detrimental humor towards the self in order to gain approval from others. Individuals high in this dimension engage in self-disparaging humor in which laughter is often at their own expense. Self-defeating humor often comes in the form of pleasing others by being the \"butt\" of the joke. This style of humor is sometimes seen as a form of denial in which humor is used as a defense mechanism for hiding negative feelings about the self.\n\nA variety of variables are associated with self-defeating humor. Individuals who more frequently use self-defeating humor show increased depressive symptoms. Individuals who use this style of humor tend to have higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness. Self-defeating humor is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychiatric symptoms. It is also associated with lower levels of self-esteem, psychological well-being and intimacy.\n\nExamples of self-defeating items on the Humor Styles Questionnaire might include:\n"}
{"id": "44089260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44089260", "title": "Humour in translation", "text": "Humour in translation\n\nHumour in translation can be caused by translation errors, because of irregularities and discrepancies between certain items that translators attempt to translate. This could be due to the ignorance of the translator, as well as the untranslatability of the text as a result of linguistic or cultural differences. In addition, translation errors can be caused by the language incompetence of the translator in the target language, resulting in unintended ambiguity in the message conveyed. Translation errors can distort the intended meaning of the author or speaker, to the point of absurdity and ludicrousness, giving a humorous and comedic effect.\nTranslation errors can cause accidental humour, which is similar to intentional humour. Like intentional humour, accidental humour is also a combination of linguistics and culture-specific features, with humour generating devices (like words and phrases) embedded in it, and is just as competent in conveying humour.\n\nMost translation errors are due to the untranslatability of the language and the failure of linguistic domestication and foreignization processes. For instance, idiomatic expressions of Chinese like 多多少少 ( [ˈduɔ duɔ ʃaʊ ʃaʊˈ] ) means ‘to an extent’ in English. However, if literally translated, the same phrase can mean ‘many many few few’, losing its original meaning and creating a ludicrous expression of meaning. A case of untranslatability is evident when Coca-Cola first entered the Chinese market in 1928. Initially there was no official representation of Coca Cola’s name in Mandarin, and random phonetic translation of Coca Cola using random Chinese characters of similar phonetics were used, resulting in the name conveying ridiculous meanings like \"female horse fastened with wax\" or \"bite the wax tadpole\" when read. There was hence a need to find four Chinese characters with pronunciations and phonology approximated the sounds \"Coca Cola\" without producing a nonsensical or adverse meaning when combined into a written phrase. This brand blunder was eventually solved when the Chinese words 可口可乐 were used instead; meaning to be translated as \"to allow the mouth to be able to rejoice,\" but conceptually acceptable.\n\nHence the combination and translation of words expressed must conform to the target culture and literal language interpretation or it would result in hilarious misunderstandings. Prime examples of such errors comes in the form of poorly translated sign posts, notices and menus that fails to cater the intended meaning to both foreign and local speakers.\n\nTranslation errors have been used widely for commercial and entertainment purposes (intentional humour). A prominent example is the comedy video, \"Japanese Titanic\" by the YouTube comedy duo, Smosh. Garnering more than 8.5 million views to date, the farcical video script was produced by translating the original dialogue of the movie \"Titanic\" into Japanese dialogue via an online translator application, then translating the Japanese dialogue back into English.\n\nColloquial expressions and conventions in the source language, can cause humour or result in a strange interpretation from the listener or reader in instances when they are not translated into equivalent expressions or conventions in the target language, and instead are translated mechanically or word-for-word.\n\nDifficulties with translation can arise from differences in word order, or from culture-bound expressions, and often also because of the inflexibility of machine translation. Also, it is due partly to the existence of multiple cultural, linguistic and semantic factors that machine translation often requires the aid of a human translator to convey the intended message of the source text.\n\nTranslation difficulties can, therefore, cause translation errors, which can result in humour. A more specific elaboration of various causes of translation errors will be discussed in the following section.\n\nBelow are some components of linguistic stimulus theories that attempts to explain the way humour might be derived from translations, as adapted from \"Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English\"'\n\nExternal factors like cultural awareness, time considerations, social class and educational considerations, along with internal factors like situation and narrative strategy also plays a big part in the effect of translation on humour.\n\nWords that are homonymic, paronymic, alliterative or rhyming, or metalinguistic devices of language can be used to produce humour. Also, wordplay which includes the use of puns, one liners, limericks, witticisms, among various others, can be another way to produce humour.\n\nFor example, these are some funny translations done by machine translators:\n\nHumour can result from the interlocutor’s inability to understand homonyms, homographs or semantically related synonym words. Similarly, words with superordinate and subordinate relationships are confused.\n\nOverlapping semantics are difficult to distinguish, especially in translation. Words with multiple meanings (polysemous words) are mostly untranslatable, especially if they contain many connotations.\nConfusion of sense relations can also result because of semantic overlap. Confusion of sense relations in the set includes the improper use of superonym for hyponym, hyponym for superonym, a whole word for a partial word, a partial word for a whole word, antonym, confusion of co-hyponyms, and misuse of near-synonyms.\n\nAn example of semantic overlap found in a golf course:\n\n\"ANY PERSONS (EXCEPT PLAYERS) CAUGHT COLLECTING GOLF BALLS ON THIS COURSE WILL BE PROSECUTED AND HAVE THEIR BALLS REMOVED\" \n\nThe interlocutor's erroneous choice of word \"removed\" instead of \"confiscated\" results in accidental humor in the context as shown in the example above. Semantically, \"removed\" is a commonly used word to express the action ‘take away’ and both are related in terms of sense. \"Removed\" thus may be used as a superordinate form that includes the action of \"taking away\". The humorous aspect of this situation is intensified with the strong use of word \"removed\" in the phrase \"have their balls removed\", relates to the sexual innuendo of castration instead of the much less extreme action of confiscation. With the overlapping of semantics, the intended message is thus misinterpreted and accidental humor is resulted.\n\nOther examples:\nLexico-semantic clusterings can result in paradigmatic errors. It reflects the relations between related words and expressions, which is mainly of paradigmatic relations. The humor above is triggered by the translated text consisting of a script-switch trigger, which then results in the double reading. The irony is not lost in the contexts provided.\n\nIn machine translation from Chinese to English the phrase \"Fuck the certain price of goods\" has become proverbial for absurd machine mistranslations. That text was on a Chinese / English bilingual sign in a supermarket and should have read \"Dry goods department\". The Simplified Chinese character 干 (link: 干) can mean \"do\" and \"dry\" and \"fuck\".\n\nLexical gaps concerns words or phrases with no direct translation in any given language.\n\nHumor, then, results from the interlocutor's inability to grasp the lexical gaps in target language and linguistic representations may either be over generalised or under generalised to the point of absurdity.\n\nThe humour comes from the translator filling in an English lexical gap based on the lexical noun, \"miss\" by adding a prefix \"mis-\". English employs the two verbs \"miss the carriage\" and \"miscarriages\" to mean vastly different actions. There is a lexical gap in English because the action of \"missing a carriage\" cannot be expressed with the same import and the same economy of verbalisation. The misuse of this lexical gap and overgeneralisation conflates the ludicrous idea of the horse-driven tours with no miscarriages.\n\nFrom the example above, the interlocutor did not understand English derivations of ‘doer’ nouns such as, \"specialist\", or suppletion such as, \"experts\" and mistakenly uses the derivational pattern to coin a lexeme from \"method\". Accidental humour ensues as a result of the same word coinciding with the unlikely homophone \"Methodist\", which refers to the Christian religious denomination, creating a ridiculous situation in the context of dentistry.\n\nAn American slogan for Salem cigarettes was, \"Salem - Feeling Free,\". When translated for marketing in the Japanese market, it means, \"When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty\". This is an example of the translator trying to fill in the connotations of the lexical unit \"free\", perhaps because of limited vocabulary competency and thus resulting in an intralingual error. In this case there are actually Japanese terms equivalent to the adjective, \"free\" ( e.g. : 自由な).\n\nAll being said, languages do have a productive (linguistics) and recursion property that can also allow words and phrases to combine creatively to fill in the lexical gaps.\n\nFor example, Telugu expressions above can seem nearly impossible to translate. But with the usage of English to translate and establish the context, the meanings of the expression can be derived to be understandable.\n\nIn some cases, incidental humor is produced when interlocutors erroneously uses lexemes based on vague morpho-phonological similarity to the target word.\n\nJapan's second-largest tourist agency was rather bewildered when it initially entered English markets and began receiving overwhelming requests for sexual tours. When they finally realized it, Kinki Nippon Tourist Company decided to change its name.\n\nAn interesting and amusing example would be the pronunciation of English words with Chinese translatability by actor Xiao Xiao Bin in the 2010 comedy-martial arts film \"Just Call Me Nobody\":\n\nThe examples from (1) to (7) illustrates the complete loss of the original meaning of the English words. Though the English pronounced sounds almost phonetically correct, the pronunciation is easily translatable to a Chinese lexeme of a depressing meaning (e.g. : ‘All die’). With the juxtaposition of the intended and accidental meaning with the cheerful pragmatics of the film, the translation becomes a hilariously erroneous one.\n\nMisspelled words can be portrayed as the most basic level of inducing unintentional humor that occur in all translations, especially in signs or restaurants' menus. The ability to create humor out of misspelled words in translations happens particularly when the lexical items in a phrase or sentence are very well-known and common to English speakers but in a particular context, the lexical items appears to possess a totally different meaning that could be inappropriate at times.\n\nAll these examples clearly show how inadvertent spelling of words can give rise to humorous transcriptions to anyone who possess a fair flair of English. In examples (4-6, 8, 9), ‘crap’, ‘shiting’, ‘porn’, ‘food’, ‘shit’ were blatantly misspelled by the translators in a way that they all share the same phonological but a complete different semantics form of another already existing pejorative word in English; ‘crab’, ‘shitting’, ‘pond’, ‘foot’ and ‘sheet’ respectively. Thus, all these examples produce unexpected smutty farce-comedy for readers, where humour seeps in as a natural corollary of this linguistic coincidence. Innocuous as the spelling mistakes may seem, the examples above (1-3, 7, 10) were also misspelled to other words that have a total different meanings as the intended words. ‘Dumping’ means the act of removing waste or garbage and it was associated with a food - ‘dumplings’. Likewise, ‘footwear’, which is worn on your foot, is written as ‘food-wear’. Additionally, ‘discount’ is written as ‘dis-cunt’ whereby cunt is an obscene word. Lastly, ‘tested’ and ‘tasted’ have a complete distinct meanings. ‘Tested’ means to identify or characterize a substance or constituents whereas ‘tasted’ means to sense the flavor of something. Thus in the case of example 10, humour not only springs from the misspelled word ‘tasted’ but is also accidentally heightened by the existence of the phrase ‘diagnostic for blood, urine, semain, stool and pregnancy’, which creates a state of intolerable linguistic redundancy. Hence, in these ways, misspelling can give a tantalising feeling of amusement to readers.\n\nUsing the wrong reference may change the translator's intended meaning and led to multiple comical interpretations for the readers, thus, producing various humorous scripts. \nFor example,\n\n(1) A sign in a Chinese Safari Park states \"大象在此 请留在车上 Elephants Here Please Stay In Your Car\"\n\nThe translator intended to refer the general public that are visiting the park as the implicit reference marker of the sign by using the co-referential anaphor 'Your', but failed to do so and instead, the explicit anaphor 'Your' unintentionally picks up 'Elephants' as the textual referent. Thus, this give rise to a humorous script that looks as though that the sign is meant for the elephants and not the people. In addition, this example highlights the importance of having punctuation to serve as a cohesion device because if the translator were to put a full stop or exclamation point after the word 'Elephants', the anaphor 'your' would have been interpreted literally for the readers. Therefore, it would have also ruled out any possibilities of humorous reading.\n\n(2) An article in Soviet Weekly reports \"There will be a Moscow Exhibition of Arts by 15,000 Soviet Republic painters and sculptors. These were executed over the past two years.\"\n\nSimilarly, there is a mishap of the anaphoric reference marker 'these', which to the interpretation of readers, refers to 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Thus, it conveys the idea that they were only executed over the past two years, as a result, generating laughter among readers. In terms of the translator's intentions, the reference marker 'these' actually refers textually to the referent 'Arts' or, perhaps, 'the painters and sculptors' works' and not 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Hence, this script lacks of an eligible textual referent to accurately bring across the intended message. Although this script is easily decipherable based upon one's basic knowledge, it still did not fail to cause laughter and humor to readers.\n\nWord order is the way in which syntactic constituents of a language arrange itself in a phrase or a sentence. Different languages employ different structures of word order. Direct translation of one language to another may result in wrong placement of a phrase in relation to the other constituents in the sentence. This may cause a change to the initial meaning of the translator and hence, may trigger a humorous script.\n\nBecause of to the incorrect placement of the adverbial phrase ‘daily except Thursday’ at the end of the sentence, this script generates unintentional humor in its translation. The adverbial phrase ‘daily except Thursday’ became a post-modifier which had misguided the readers into thinking that the script is about the act of burying ‘famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers’, instead of conveying the act of people visiting the cemetery. Apparently, the translator wanted to avoid a possible awkwardness of phrasing the post-modifier after the appropriate act, but was unaware that the parentheses applied would also enclose another awkward and comical adverbial at the same time.\n\nLikewise, the humour in this case is also caused by the wrong placement of the prepositional phrase ‘with nuts’ as a post-modifier of ‘the ladies’ instead of its intended referent ‘cocktails’ as a post-modifier. Although the mishap is triggered by the mistaken word order, which can be changed to \"Special cocktails with nuts for the ladies\", it would still have remained as an awkward sentence because of the polysemous word ‘nuts’. Thus, if the word ‘nuts’ were to be replaced with ‘cashews’, any humorous translation error would not have been present. Therefore, it should be noted that attachment sites of prepositional phrases are a notorious source of ambiguity in English.\n"}

{"id": "254364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254364", "title": "Mathematical fallacy", "text": "Mathematical fallacy\n\nIn mathematics, certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept of mathematical fallacy. There is a distinction between a simple \"mistake\" and a \"mathematical fallacy\" in a proof: a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof just in the same way, but in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is some concealment in the presentation of the proof. For example, the reason validity fails may be a division by zero that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a certain quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way. Therefore, these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions. Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are conditional, and are not applicable in the cases that are the exceptions to the rules.\n\nThe traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, so that the meaning of fallacy is here slightly different from the logical fallacy. The latter applies normally to a form of argument that is not a genuine rule of logic, where the problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to deeper insights into a subject (such as the introduction of Pasch's axiom of Euclidean geometry and the five colour theorem of graph theory). \"Pseudaria\", an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to Euclid.\n\nMathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics. In elementary algebra, typical examples may involve a step where division by zero is performed, where a root is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values of a multiple valued function are equated. Well-known fallacies also exist in elementary Euclidean geometry and calculus.\n\nExamples exist of mathematically correct results derived by incorrect lines of reasoning. Such an argument, however true the conclusion, is mathematically invalid and is commonly known as a \"howler\". For example, the calculation (anomalous cancellation):\nAlthough the conclusion formula_2 is correct, there is a fallacious, invalid cancellation in the middle step. Another classical example of a howler is by simply substituting the scalar variables of the characteristic polynomial by the matrix.\n\nBogus proofs, calculations, or derivations constructed to produce a correct result in spite of incorrect logic or operations were termed \"howlers\" by Maxwell. Outside the field of mathematics the term \"howler\" has various meanings, generally less specific.\n\nThe division-by-zero fallacy has many variants. The following example uses division by zero to \"prove\" that formula_3, but can be modified to prove that any number equals any other number.\n\n\n\"Q.E.D.\"\n\nThe fallacy is in line 5: the progression from line 4 to line 5 involves division by \"a\" − \"b\", which is zero since \"a\" equals \"b\". Since division by zero is undefined, the argument is invalid.\n\nMany functions do not have a unique inverse. For instance, while squaring a number gives a unique value, there are two possible square roots of a positive number. The square root is multivalued. One value can be chosen by convention as the principal value; in the case of the square root the non-negative value is the principal value, but there is no guarantee that the square root given as the principal value of the square of a number will be equal to the original number; e.g. the principal square root of the square of −2 is 2.\n\nCalculus as the mathematical study of infinitesimal change and limits can lead to mathematical fallacies if the properties of integrals and differentials are ignored. For instance, a naive use of integration by parts can be used to give a false proof that 0 = 1. Letting formula_20 and formula_21, we may write:\n\nafter which the antiderivatives may be cancelled yielding 0 = 1. The problem is that antiderivatives are only defined up to a constant and shifting them by 1 or indeed any number is allowed. The error really comes to light when we introduce arbitrary integration limits \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nSince the difference between two values of a constant function vanishes, the same definite integral appears on both sides of the equation.\n\nFallacies involving disregarding the rules of elementary arithmetic through an incorrect manipulation of the radical.\n\nCare must be taken when taking the square root of both sides of an equality. Failing to do so results in a proof of\nProof:\n\nThe fallacy is in the second to last line, where the square root of both sides is taken: \"a\" = \"b\" only implies \"a\" = \"b\" if \"a\" and \"b\" have the same sign, which is not the case here. In this case it implies \"a\" = –\"b\" and should read 5-9/2 = -(4-9/2), which, by adding 9/2 on both sides, correctly reduces to 5 = 5.\n\nAs another example of the danger of taking the square root of both sides of an equation, consider the fundamental identity\nwhich holds as a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. Then, by taking a square root,\nso that\nBut evaluating this when \"x\" = π implies\nor\nwhich is incorrect.\n\nThe error in each of these examples fundamentally lies in the fact that any equation of the form\nhas two solutions, provided \"a\" ≠ 0,\nand it is essential to check which of these solutions is relevant to the problem at hand. In the above fallacy, the square root that allowed the second equation to be deduced from the first is valid only when cos \"x\" is positive. In particular, when \"x\" is set to π, the second equation is rendered invalid.\n\nWhen both sides of an equation are squared, sometimes solutions are induced that were not present in the original equation.\n\nAn example of this kind of fallacy, is the following invalid proof that formula_41:\nWhen the square root was extracted, it was the \"negative\" root −2, rather than the \"positive\" root, that was relevant for the particular solution in the problem.\n\nInvalid proofs utilizing powers and roots are often of the following kind:\n\nThe fallacy is that the rule formula_47 is generally valid only if both \"x\" and \"y\" are positive (when dealing with real numbers), which is not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, imaginary roots are obfuscated in the following:\n\nThe error here lies in the last equality, where we are ignoring the other fourth roots of 1, which are −1, \"i\" and −\"i\" (where \"i\" is the imaginary unit). Since we have squared our figure and then taken roots, we cannot always assume that all the roots will be correct. So the correct fourth roots are \"i\" and −\"i\", which are the imaginary numbers defined to square to −1.\n\nWhen a number is raised to a complex power, the result is not uniquely defined (see Failure of power and logarithm identities). If this property is not recognized, then errors such as the following can result:\n\nThe error here is that the rule of multiplying exponents as when going to the third line does not apply unmodified with complex exponents, even if when putting both sides to the power only the principal value is chosen. When treated as multivalued functions, both sides produce the same set of values, being .\n\nMany mathematical fallacies in geometry arise from using in an additive equality involving oriented quantities (such adding vectors along a given line or adding oriented angles in the plane) a valid identity, but which fixes only the absolute value of (one of) these quantities. This quantity is then incorporated into the equation with the wrong orientation, so as to produce an absurd conclusion. This wrong orientation is usually suggested implicitly by supplying an imprecise diagram of the situation, where relative positions of points or lines are chosen in a way that is actually impossible under the hypotheses of the argument, but non-obviously so. Such a fallacy is easy to expose by drawing a precise picture of the situation, in which some relative positions will be different from those in the provided diagram. In order to avoid such fallacies, a correct geometric argument using addition or subtraction of distances or angles should always prove that quantities are being incorporated with their correct orientation.\n\nThe fallacy of the isosceles triangle, from , purports to show that every triangle is isosceles, meaning that two sides of the triangle are congruent. This fallacy has been attributed to Lewis Carroll.\n\nGiven a triangle △ABC, prove that AB = AC:\n\"Q.E.D.\"\n\nAs a corollary, one can show that all triangles are equilateral, by showing that AB = BC and AC = BC in the same way.\n\nThe error in the proof is the assumption in the diagram that the point O is \"inside\" the triangle. In fact, O always lies at the circumcircle of the △ABC (except for isosceles and equilateral triangles where AO and OD coincide). Furthermore, it can be shown that, if AB is longer than AC, then R will lie \"within\" AB, while Q will lie \"outside\" of AC (and vice versa). (Any diagram drawn with sufficiently accurate instruments will verify the above two facts.) Because of this, AB is still AR + RB, but AC is actually AQ − QC; and thus the lengths are not necessarily the same.\n\nThere exist several fallacious proofs by induction in which one of the components, basis case or inductive step, is incorrect. Intuitively, proofs by induction work by arguing that, if a statement is true in one case, it is true in the next case, and hence by repeatedly applying this it can be shown to be true for all cases. This \"proof\" shows that all horses are the same colour.\n\n\nThe fallacy in this proof arises in line 3. For N = 1, the two groups of horses have N − 1 = 0 horses in common, and thus are not necessarily the same colour as each other, so the group of N + 1 = 2 horses is not necessarily all of the same colour. The implication \"Every N horses are of the same colour, then N+1 horses are of the same colour\" works for any N greater than one, but fails to be true when N = 1. The basis case is correct, but the induction step has a fundamental flaw. If we were additionally given the fact that any two horses shared the same colour, we could correctly induct from the base case of N = 2.\n\n\n"}

It can be conducted for a variety of reasons, including political, commercial, scientific, and so on.\n\nIn the commercial sphere, this activity is usually carried out in house or by a media monitoring service, a private company that provides such services to other companies, organisations and individuals on a subscription basis.\n\nThe services that media monitoring companies provide typically include the systematic recording of radio and television broadcasts, the collection of press clippings from print media publications, the collection of data from online information sources. The material collected usually consists of any media output that makes reference to the client, its activities and/or its designated topics of interests. The monitoring of online consumer sources such as blogs, forums and social networks is more specifically known as buzz monitoring which informs the company of how its service or product is perceived by users.\n\nWhile monitoring social media it can be beneficial for a company to respond to as many posts as possible. Not all comments will be positive ones, but it is good for the customers to know they are being heard. It is also important to keep in mind to avoid deleting any unfavorable content from a social media page you control. You should assume that something on the Internet was seen by at least one person, no matter how quickly you delete it. Deleting the comment can make the company look even worse and give the idea of a cover-up which implies guilt on the company’s part.\n\nMost media monitoring is done within private public relations agencies or businesses in house public relations sectors. Publicists will track the number of times the company was mentioned within different platforms. Some of the main platforms include magazines, newspaper, blogs, and social media. These entries are referred to as “clippings” and are compiled into monthly reports by the Public Relations firm. These clippings are then presented to the client along with the circulation and impressions from these platforms. Circulation is how many subscribers or viewers the platform has, and impressions are calculated by multiplying the circulation by three. Impressions are only calculated for print media because it is assumed print media will be circulated past the original subscribers. These figures are calculated to show the client approximately how many people their message has reached. Media monitoring is a beneficial tool to evaluate the efforts and progress of a PR firm.\n\nIn academia media monitoring is deployed by social scientists in an attempt to discover e.g. biases in the way the same event is presented in different media, among the media of different countries etc. The use of large scale monitoring techniques by computer scientists enabled the exploration of different aspects of the media system such as the visualisation of the media-sphere, the sentimental and objectivity analysis of news content etc.\n\nMedia monitoring is practically achieved by a combination of technologies—including audio and video recording, high speed text scanners and text recognition software—and human readers and analysts. The automation of the process is highly desirable and can be partially achieved by deploying data mining and machine learning techniques.\n\n"}

A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public art galleries, and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a \"de facto\" art gallery, providing space for art installations, performances (music, film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.\n\nIn 1989, the Helsinki Festival established its Night of the Arts, \"when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue\". A year later, the mayor of Nantes, Jean-Marc Ayrault's program included renovating the central city and establishing a \"contemporary patrimony\", which led arts programmer Jean Blaise to create a late-night cultural festival, \"Les Allumées\" (\"Things Alight\"). His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6 pm to 6 am, over six years with artists from six cities.\n\nThey were as follows:\n\nIn 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual White Nights Festival in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the Scarlet Sails celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included pop culture (e.g. the Rolling Stones in the open air at Palace Square) in 2007 and high culture events (\"Stars of the White Nights Festival\" at the Mariinsky Theatre under Valery Gergiev) every year since 1993.\n\nIn 1997, the Long Night of Museums, took place in the newly re-united Berlin with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.\n\nIn 2001, when Bertrand Delanoë became Mayor of Paris, his deputy, Christophe Girard, invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born. The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. \"The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since.\"\n\nThe idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as \"Nuits Blanches Europe\". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates.\n\nIn 2013, Melbourne hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, laneways, shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport. This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia.\n\nContinuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community. In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the \"Noche en Blanco\" was made between 2013 and 2015.\n"}

{"id": "22348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22348", "title": "Opera", "text": "Opera\n\nOpera (; English plural: \"operas\"; Italian plural: \"opere\" ) is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers. Such a \"work\" (the literal translation of \"opera\") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.\n\nOpera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition. Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater, \"Singspiel\" and \"Opéra comique\". In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and self-contained arias. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama.\n\nOpera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost \"Dafne\", produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his \"reform\" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially \"The Marriage of Figaro\" (\"Le nozze di Figaro\"), \"Don Giovanni\", and \"Così fan tutte\", as well as \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\"), and \"The Magic Flute\" (\"Die Zauberflöte\"), landmarks in the German tradition.\n\nThe first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), Neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and Minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed.\n\nThe words of an opera are known as the libretto (literally \"small book\"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte. Traditional opera, often referred to as \"number opera\", consists of two modes of singing: recitative, the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech, and aria (an \"air\" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as singspiel, opéra comique, operetta, and semi-opera, the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as arioso. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail below. During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: \"secco\" (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by \"basso continuo\", which was usually a harpsichord and a cello; or \"accompagnato\" (also known as \"strumentato\") in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, \"accompagnato\" had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed \"endless melody\". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his \"The Rake's Progress\" have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail below.\n\nThe Italian word \"opera\" means \"work\", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin \"opera\", a singular noun meaning \"work\" and also the plural of the noun \"opus\". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Italian word was first used in the sense \"composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined\" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.\n\n\"Dafne\" by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the \"Camerata de' Bardi\". Significantly, \"Dafne\" was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance. The members of the Camerata considered that the \"chorus\" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of \"restoring\" this situation. \"Dafne,\" however, is lost. A later work by Peri, \"Euridice\", dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to Claudio Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\", composed for the court of Mantua in 1607. The Mantua court of the Gonzagas, employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the concerto delle donne (till 1598), but also one of the first actual \"opera singers\"; Madama Europa.\n\nOpera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a \"season\" (Carnival) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\", for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower Francesco Cavalli helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the Arcadian Academy, which came to be associated with the poet Metastasio, whose libretti helped crystallize the genre of opera seria, which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called opera buffa.\nBefore such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an \"opera-within-an-opera.\" One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell'arte, a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of \"intermezzi\", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.\n\n\"Opera seria\" was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of \"secco\" recitative interspersed with long \"da capo\" arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of \"opera seria\" the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male castrato voice, which was produced by castration of the singer before puberty, which prevented a boy's larynx from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as Farinelli and Senesino, as well as female sopranos such as Faustina Bordoni, became in great demand throughout Europe as \"opera seria\" ruled the stage in every country except France. Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like Handel found himself composing the likes of \"Rinaldo\" and \"Giulio Cesare\" for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the classical period as well, for example in the operas of Mozart, who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of opera seria include Alessandro Scarlatti, Vivaldi and Porpora.\n\nOpera seria had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. Francesco Algarotti's \"Essay on the Opera\" (1755) proved to be an inspiration for Christoph Willibald Gluck's reforms. He advocated that \"opera seria\" had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 Melchior Grimm published \"\", an influential article for the Encyclopédie on lyric and opera librettos. Several composers of the period, including Niccolò Jommelli and Tommaso Traetta, attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a \"beautiful simplicity\". This is evident in his first reform opera, \"Orfeo ed Euridice\", where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.\n\nGluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte, notably \"Le Nozze di Figaro\", \"Don Giovanni\", and \"Così fan tutte\", which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to \"opera seria\" was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as \"Idomeneo\" and \"La clemenza di Tito\", he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.\n\nThe bel canto opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Pacini, Mercadante and many others. Literally \"beautiful singing\", \"bel canto\" opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" and \"La Cenerentola\", as well as Bellini's \"Norma\" and Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\".\nFollowing the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by Giuseppe Verdi, beginning with his biblical opera \"Nabucco\". This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of Italian nationalism in the post-Napoleonic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: \"Rigoletto\", \"Il trovatore\" and \"La traviata\". The first of these, \"Rigoletto\", proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be \"an unending string of duets\". \"La traviata\" was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first \"realistic\" operas, because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French Grand Opera, \"Don Carlos\", and ending his career with two Shakespeare-inspired works, \"Otello\" and \"Falstaff\", which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In \"Falstaff\", Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, \"Falstaff\" contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors Giacomo Puccini, Richard Strauss, and Benjamin Britten.\n\nAfter Verdi, the sentimental \"realistic\" melodrama of verismo appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" and Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as Giacomo Puccini's \"La bohème\", \"Tosca\", and \"Madama Butterfly\". Later Italian composers, such as Berio and Nono, have experimented with modernism.\n\nThe first German opera was \"Dafne\", composed by Heinrich Schütz in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, Sigmund Staden produced the first \"Singspiel\", \"Seelewig\", a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in Hamburg presented German operas by Keiser, Telemann and Handel. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as Graun, Hasse and later Gluck, chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.\n\nMozart's \"Singspiele\", \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (1782) and \"Die Zauberflöte\" (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by Beethoven with his \"Fidelio\", inspired by the climate of the French Revolution. Carl Maria von Weber established German Romantic opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian bel canto. His \"Der Freischütz\" (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include Marschner, Schubert and Lortzing, but the most significant figure was undoubtedly Wagner.\n\nWagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of Weber and Meyerbeer, he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" (a \"complete work of art\"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of leitmotifs, recurring themes often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as \"Der fliegende Holländer\", \"Tannhäuser\" and \"Lohengrin\"; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as tonality, in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, \"Tristan und Isolde\", \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\", \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" and \"Parsifal\", he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of \"endless melody\". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from Germanic or Arthurian legend. Finally, Wagner built his own opera house at Bayreuth with part of the patronage from Ludwig II of Bavaria, exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.\n\nOpera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, Richard Strauss accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous \"Salome\" and the dark tragedy \"Elektra\", in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, \"Der Rosenkavalier\", where Mozart and Viennese waltzes became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include Alexander von Zemlinsky, Erich Korngold, Franz Schreker, Paul Hindemith, Kurt Weill and the Italian-born Ferruccio Busoni. The operatic innovations of Arnold Schoenberg and his successors are discussed in the section on modernism.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II, an admirer of the French-language operettas composed by Jacques Offenbach, composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was \"Die Fledermaus\", which is still regularly performed today. Nevertheless, rather than copying the style of Offenbach, the operettas of Strauss II had distinctly Viennese flavor to them, which have cemented the Strauss II's place as one of the most renowned operetta composers of all time.\n\nIn rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of King Louis XIV. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an Academy of Music and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with \"Cadmus et Hermione\", Lully and his librettist Quinault created \"tragédie en musique\", a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive recitative which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was Jean-Philippe Rameau, who composed five \"tragédies en musique\" as well as numerous works in other genres such as opéra-ballet, all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian opera seria throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead. After Rameau's death, the German Gluck was persuaded to produce six operas for the Parisian stage in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: \"opéra comique\". This was the equivalent of the German singspiel, where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by Monsigny, Philidor and, above all, Grétry. During the Revolutionary period, composers such as Méhul and Cherubini, who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly \"comic\" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. Gossec's \"Le triomphe de la République\" (1793).\nBy the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian bel canto, especially after the arrival of Rossini in Paris. Rossini's \"Guillaume Tell\" helped found the new genre of Grand Opera, a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, Giacomo Meyerbeer. Meyerbeer's works, such as \"Les Huguenots\", emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter \"opéra comique\" also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of Boïeldieu, Auber, Hérold and Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece \"Les Troyens\", the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Jacques Offenbach created operetta with witty and cynical works such as \"Orphée aux enfers\", as well as the opera \"Les Contes d'Hoffmann\"; Charles Gounod scored a massive success with \"Faust\"; and Georges Bizet composed \"Carmen\", which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of Romanticism and realism, became the most popular of all opéra comiques. Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns and Léo Delibes all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's \"Manon\", Saint-Saëns' \"Samson et Dalila\" and Delibes' \"Lakmé\". Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique. At the same time, the influence of Richard Wagner was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from Claude Debussy. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.\n\nOther notable 20th-century names include Ravel, Dukas, Roussel and Milhaud. Francis Poulenc is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include \"Dialogues des Carmélites\") have gained a foothold in the international repertory. Olivier Messiaen's lengthy sacred drama \"Saint François d'Assise\" (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.\n\nIn England, opera's antecedent was the 17th-century \"jig\". This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently libellous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French masque was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. Inigo Jones became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In Ben Jonson's \"Lovers Made Men\" (1617), \"the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo\". The approach of the English Commonwealth closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the dramatist Sir William Davenant produced \"The Siege of Rhodes\". Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by \"The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru\" (1658) and \"The History of Sir Francis Drake\" (1659). These pieces were encouraged by Oliver Cromwell because they were critical of Spain. With the English Restoration, foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, Thomas Shadwell's \"Psyche\", patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by Molière and Jean-Baptiste Lully. William Davenant produced \"The Tempest\" in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a Shakespeare play (composed by Locke and Johnson). About 1683, John Blow composed \"Venus and Adonis\", often thought of as the first true English-language opera.\n\nBlow's immediate successor was the better known Henry Purcell. Despite the success of his masterwork \"Dido and Aeneas\" (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the semi-opera format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as Shakespeare in Purcell's \"The Fairy-Queen\" (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in \"The Prophetess\" (1690) and \"Bonduca\" (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator John Dryden) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.\nFollowing Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne, both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being \"Thomas and Sally\" in 1760. His opera \"Artaxerxes\" (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, \"Love in a Village\" (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Charles Burney wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\".\n\nBesides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was George Frideric Handel, whose \"opera serias\" filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like John Frederick Lampe, who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of Michael William Balfe, and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.\n\nThe only exceptions were ballad operas, such as John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" (1728), musical burlesques, European operettas, and late Victorian era light operas, notably the Savoy Operas of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\" (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876), but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of \"English\" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's \"Daily Telegraph\" agreed, describing \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" as \"a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage\". Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&S series, including \"Haddon Hall\" and \"The Beauty Stone\", but \"Ivanhoe\" (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record until Broadway's \"La bohème\") survives as his only Grand Opera.\n\nIn the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of Ralph Vaughan Williams and in particular Benjamin Britten, who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently Sir Harrison Birtwistle has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera \"Punch and Judy\" to his most recent critical success in The Minotaur. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, Michael Nyman, has been focusing on composing operas, including \"Facing Goya\", \"\", and \"Love Counts\". Today composers such as Thomas Adès continue to export English opera abroad.\n\nAlso in the 20th century, American composers like Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, Gian Carlo Menotti, Douglas Moore, and Carlisle Floyd began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as Philip Glass, Mark Adamo, John Corigliano, Robert Moran, John Coolidge Adams, André Previn and Jake Heggie.\n\nOpera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the Italian operatic troupes and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and aristocracy. Many foreign composers such as Baldassare Galuppi, Giovanni Paisiello, Giuseppe Sarti, and Domenico Cimarosa (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the Italian language. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like Maksym Berezovsky and Dmitry Bortniansky were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was \"Tsefal i Prokris\" by the Italian composer Francesco Araja (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers Vasily Pashkevich, Yevstigney Fomin and Alexey Verstovsky.\n\nHowever, the real birth of Russian opera came with Mikhail Glinka and his two great operas \"A Life for the Tsar\" (1836) and \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as \"Rusalka\" and \"The Stone Guest\" by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, \"Boris Godunov\" and \"Khovanshchina\" by Modest Mussorgsky, \"Prince Igor\" by Alexander Borodin, \"Eugene Onegin\" and \"The Queen of Spades\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and \"The Snow Maiden\" and \"Sadko\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian nationalism across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general Slavophilism movement.\n\nIn the 20th century, the traditions of Russian opera were developed by many composers including Sergei Rachmaninoff in his works \"The Miserly Knight\" and \"Francesca da Rimini\", Igor Stravinsky in \"Le Rossignol\", \"Mavra\", \"Oedipus rex\", and \"The Rake's Progress\", Sergei Prokofiev in \"The Gambler\", \"The Love for Three Oranges\", \"The Fiery Angel\", \"Betrothal in a Monastery\", and \"War and Peace\"; as well as Dmitri Shostakovich in \"The Nose\" and \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\", Edison Denisov in \"L'écume des jours\", and Alfred Schnittke in \"Life with an Idiot\" and \"Historia von D. Johann Fausten\".\n\nSpain also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as zarzuela, which had two separate flowerings: one from the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, and another beginning around 1850. During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.\n\nCzech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with Bedřich Smetana, who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular \"The Bartered Bride\". Antonín Dvořák, most famous for \"Rusalka\", wrote 13 operas; and Leoš Janáček gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including \"Jenůfa\", \"The Cunning Little Vixen\", and \"Káťa Kabanová\".\n\nIn Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky (1813–1873) whose most famous work \"Zaporozhets za Dunayem\" (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include Mykola Lysenko (\"Taras Bulba\" and \"Natalka Poltavka\"), Heorhiy Maiboroda, and Yuliy Meitus. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in Georgia under the leadership Zacharia Paliashvili, who fused local folk songs and stories with 19th-century Romantic classical themes.\nThe key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was Ferenc Erkel, whose works mostly dealt with historical themes. Among his most often performed operas are \"Hunyadi László\" and \"Bánk bán\". The most famous modern Hungarian opera is Béla Bartók's \"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\".\n\nStanisław Moniuszko's opera \"Straszny Dwór\" (in English \"The Haunted Manor\") (1861–64) represents a nineteenth-century peak of Polish national opera. In the 20th century, other operas created by Polish composers included \"King Roger\" by Karol Szymanowski and \"Ubu Rex\" by Krzysztof Penderecki.\n\nThe first known opera from Turkey (the Ottoman Empire) was \"Arshak II\", which was an Armenian opera composed by an ethnic Armenian composer Tigran Tchoukhajian in 1868 and partially performed in 1873. It was fully staged in 1945 in Armenia.\n\nThe first years of the Soviet Union saw the emergence of new national operas, such as the \"Koroğlu\" (1937) by the Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. The first Kyrgyz opera, \"Ai-Churek\", premiered in Moscow at the Bolshoi Theatre on 26 May 1939, during Kyrgyz Art Decade. It was composed by Vladimir Vlasov, Abdylas Maldybaev and Vladimir Fere. The libretto was written by Joomart Bokonbaev, Jusup Turusbekov, and Kybanychbek Malikov. The opera is based on the Kyrgyz heroic epic \"Manas\".\n\nChinese contemporary classical opera, a Chinese language form of Western style opera that is distinct from traditional Chinese opera, has had operas dating back to \"The White Haired Girl\" in 1945.\n\nIn Latin America, opera started as a result of European colonisation. The first opera ever written in the Americas was \"La púrpura de la rosa\", by Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco, although \"Partenope\", by the Mexican Manuel de Zumaya, was the first opera written from a composer born in Latin America (music now lost). The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was \"A Noite de São João\", by Elias Álvares Lobo. However, Antonio Carlos Gomes is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as \"Il Guarany\". Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires—with the opera \"Aurora\", by Ettore Panizza, being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include Felipe Boero and Alberto Ginastera.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of atonality. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with Richard Wagner, and in particular the Tristan chord. Composers such as Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy, Giacomo Puccini, Paul Hindemith, Benjamin Britten and Hans Pfitzner pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by Giuseppe Verdi in his \"Falstaff\". Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.\nOperatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, Arnold Schoenberg and his student Alban Berg, both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), dodecaphony. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, \"Erwartung\" (1909, premiered in 1924) and \"Die glückliche Hand\" display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used Sprechstimme.\n\nThe two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, \"Wozzeck\" (1925) and \"Lulu\" (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.\n\nComposers thus influenced include the Englishman Benjamin Britten, the German Hans Werner Henze, and the Russian Dmitri Shostakovich. (Philip Glass also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as minimalist, usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)\n\nHowever, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of neoclassicism. An early leader of this movement was Ferruccio Busoni, who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical number opera \"Arlecchino\" (first performed in 1917). Also among the vanguard was the Russian Igor Stravinsky. After composing music for the Diaghilev-produced ballets \"Petrushka\" (1911) and \"The Rite of Spring\" (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio \"Oedipus Rex\" (1927). Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including \"Renard\" (1916: \"a burlesque in song and dance\") and \"The Soldier's Tale\" (1918: \"to be read, played, and danced\"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of \"Melodrama\". Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works \"The Nightingale\" (1914), and \"Mavra\" (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore serialist technique and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style diatonic number opera \"The Rake's Progress\" (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many other composers.\n\nA common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of Benjamin Britten's operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; Mark Adamo's two-act realization of \"Little Women\" is scored for 18 instrumentalists.\n\nAnother feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. \"The Death of Klinghoffer\", \"Nixon in China\", and \"Doctor Atomic\" by John Adams, \"Dead Man Walking\" by Jake Heggie, and \"Anna Nicole\" by Mark-Anthony Turnage exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60. Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for classical music since the last decades of the 20th century. In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.\n\nSmaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a \"patchwork quilt\" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers. Nevertheless, some smaller companies have found ways of drawing new audiences. Opera Carolina offer discounts and happy hour events to the 21- to 40-year-old demographic. In addition to radio and television broadcasts of opera performances, which have had some success in gaining new audiences, broadcasts of live performances in HD to movie theatres have shown the potential to reach new audiences. Since 2006, the Met has broadcast live performances to several hundred movie screens all over the world.\n\nBy the late 1930s, some musicals began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935), influenced by jazz styles, and \"Candide\" (1956), with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on Broadway but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. Popular musicals such as \"Show Boat\", \"West Side Story\", \"Brigadoon\", \"\", \"Passion\", \"Evita\", \"The Light in the Piazza\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses. \"The Most Happy Fella\" (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the New York City Opera. Other rock influenced musicals, such as \"Tommy\" (1969) and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (1971), \"Les Misérables\" (1980), \"Rent\" (1996), \"Spring Awakening\" (2006), and \"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\" (2012) employ various operatic conventions, such as through composition, recitative instead of dialogue, and leitmotifs.\n\nA subtle type of sound electronic reinforcement called acoustic enhancement is used in some modern concert halls and theatres where operas are performed. Although none of the major opera houses \"...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre\", many use a sound reinforcement system for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in \"Tosca\" or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).\n\nOperatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.\n\nSingers and the roles they play are classified by voice type, based on the tessitura, agility, power and timbre of their voices. Male singers can be classified by vocal range as bass, bass-baritone, baritone, tenor and countertenor, and female singers as contralto, mezzo-soprano and soprano. (Men sometimes sing in the \"female\" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed sopranist or countertenor. The countertenor is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for castrati—men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by size—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, coloratura, soubrette, spinto, or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.\n\nYet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the \"Basso Buffo\" who often must be a specialist in patter as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the \"Fach\" system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken drama were often put on by the same repertory company.\n\nA particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, \"premiere dugazon\" and \"deuxieme dugazon\", were named after successive stages in the career of Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the Parisian theatres are \"baryton-martin\" and soprano \"falcon\".\n\nThe soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a castrato. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the Classical period. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high A (Handel, for example, only wrote one role extending to a high C), though the castrato Farinelli was alleged to possess a top D (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's \"Dido and Aeneas\" to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing \"witches, bitches, and britches\" roles. In recent years many of the \"trouser roles\" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.\n\nThe tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the \"bel canto\" era, such as Donizetti's sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during \"La fille du régiment\". With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as \"Heldentenor\"; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's \"Turandot\". Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in \"opera seria\" in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in \"Don Giovanni\" to the nobility of Wotan in Wagner's \"Ring Cycle,\" to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's \"Don Carlos\". In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's \"Così fan tutte\" to Posa in Verdi's \"Don Carlos\"; the actual designation \"baritone\" was not standard until the mid-19th century.\n\nEarly performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a castrato, and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as Senesino and Farinelli, became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or prima donna), Anna Renzi, dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with Faustina Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni, who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an haute-contre (a high tenor), of which Joseph Legros (1739–1793) was a leading example.\nThough opera patronage has decreased in the last century in favor of other arts and media (such as musicals, cinema, radio, television and recordings), mass media and the advent of recording have supported the popularity of many famous singers including Maria Callas, Enrico Caruso, Amelita Galli-Curci, Kirsten Flagstad, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres,\nMario Del Monaco, Risë Stevens, Alfredo Kraus, Franco Corelli, Montserrat Caballé, Joan Sutherland, Birgit Nilsson, Nellie Melba, Rosa Ponselle, Beniamino Gigli, Jussi Björling, Feodor Chaliapin, Cecilia Bartoli, Renée Fleming, Marilyn Horne, Bryn Terfel and \"The Three Tenors\" (Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo, and José Carreras).\n\nBefore the 1700s, Italian operas used a small string orchestra, but it rarely played to accompany the singers. Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the basso continuo group, which consisted of the harpsichord, \"plucked instruments\" such as lute and a bass instrument. The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's \"...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing\". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral ritornello to mark the end of a singer's solo. During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives \"...as special\"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as Domenico Sarro, Leonardo Vinci, Giambattista Pergolesi, Leonardo Leo, and Johann Adolf Hasse added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.\n\nThe orchestra has also provided an instrumental overture before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. Peri's \"Euridice\" opens with a brief instrumental ritornello, and Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) opens with a toccata, in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets. The French overture as found in Jean-Baptiste Lully's operas consist of a slow introduction in a marked \"dotted rhythm\", followed by a lively movement in fugato style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in Henry Purcell's \"Dido and Aeneas\". Handel also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as Giulio Cesare.\n\nIn Italy, a distinct form called \"overture\" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of Alessandro Scarlatti, and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century. It uses three generally homophonic movements: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the gigue or minuet, and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called \"sonatina form\" (sonata form without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.\n\nIn Italian opera after about 1800, the \"overture\" became known as the \"sinfonia\". Fisher also notes the term \"Sinfonia avanti l'opera\" (literally, the \"symphony before the opera\") was \"an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work\". In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, \"Vorspiel\", \"Einleitung\", Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.\n\nThe role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The orchestration of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as \"Tristan\", the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or leitmotifs, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which \"...elevated its status to that of a prima donna.\" Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to \"Das Rheingold\" calls for six harps.\n\nAs the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the concertmaster, would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of music director became termed the conductor, and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the orchestra pit and the singers up on stage.\n\nSince the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" or \"Don Carlos\" are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.\n\nTill the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian. After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers.\"The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship,\" explains mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick. \"[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called surtitles) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction, today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's proscenium arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a RAI broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.\n\nToday, operas are only rarely performed in translation. Exceptions include the English National Opera, the Opera Theater of St. Louis, Opera Theater of Pittsburgh, and Opera South East, which favor English translations. Another exception are opera productions intended for a young audience, such as Humperdinck's \"Hansel and Gretel\" and some productions of Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nOutside the US, and especially in Europe, most opera houses receive public subsidies from taxpayers. In Milan, Italy, 60% of La Scala's annual budget of €115 million is from ticket sales and private donations, with the remaining 40% coming from public funds. In 2005, La Scala received 25% of Italy's total state subsidy of €464 million for the performing arts. In the UK, Arts Council England provides funds to Opera North, the Royal Opera House, Welsh National Opera, and English National Opera. Between 2012 and 2015, these four opera companies along with the English National Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and Northern Ballet accounted for 22% of the funds in the Arts Council's national portfolio. During that period, the Council undertook an analysis of its funding for large-scale opera and ballet companies, setting recommendations and targets for the companies to meet prior to the 2015–2018 funding decisions. In February 2015, concerns over English National Opera's business plan led to the Arts Council placing it \"under special funding arrangements\" in what \"The Independent\" termed \"the unprecedented step\" of threatening to withdraw public funding if the Council's concerns were not met by 2017. European public funding to opera has led to a disparity between the number of year-round opera houses in Europe and the United States. For example, \"Germany has about 80 year-round opera houses [as of 2004], while the U.S., with more than three times the population, does not have any. Even the Met only has a seven-month season.\"\n\nA milestone for opera broadcasting in the U.S. was achieved on December 24, 1951, with the live broadcast of \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\", an opera in one act by Gian Carlo Menotti. It was the first opera specifically composed for television in America. Another milestone occurred in Italy in 1992 when \"Tosca\" was broadcast live from its original Roman settings and times of the day: The first act came from the 16th-century Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at noon on Saturday; the 16th-century Palazzo Farnese was the setting for the second at 8:15 P.M.; and on Sunday at 6 A.M., the third act was broadcast from Castel Sant'Angelo. The production was transmitted via satellite to 105 countries.\n\nMajor opera companies have begun presenting their performances in local cinemas throughout the United States and many other countries. The Metropolitan Opera began a series of live high-definition video transmissions to cinemas around the world in 2006. In 2007, Met performances were shown in over 424 theaters in 350 U.S. cities. \"La bohème\" went out to 671 screens worldwide. San Francisco Opera began prerecorded video transmissions in March 2008. As of June 2008, approximately 125 theaters in 117 U.S. cities carry the showings. The HD video opera transmissions are presented via the same HD digital cinema projectors used for major Hollywood films. European opera houses and festivals including the Royal Opera in London, La Scala in Milan, the Salzburg Festival, La Fenice in Venice, and the Maggio Musicale in Florence have also transmitted their productions to theaters in cities around the world since 2006, including 90 cities in the U.S.\n\nThe emergence of the Internet has also affected the way in which audiences consume opera. In 2009 the British Glyndebourne Festival Opera offered for the first time an online digital video download of its complete 2007 production of \"Tristan und Isolde\". In 2013 season the festival streamed all six of its productions online. In July 2012 the first online community opera was premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival. Titled \"Free Will\", it was created by members of the Internet group Opera By You. Its 400 members from 43 countries wrote the libretto, composed the music, and designed the sets and costumes using the Wreckamovie web platform. Savonlinna Opera Festival provided professional soloists, an 80-member choir, a symphony orchestra, and the stage machinery. It was performed live at the festival and streamed live on the internet.\n\nNotes\nMain sources\n\nOther sources\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "490309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=490309", "title": "Peep show", "text": "Peep show\n\nA peep show or peepshow is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or magnifying glass. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a sex show or pornographic film which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of depth perception, while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.\n\nPeep shows, also known as peep box or raree show (\"rarity show\") can be traced back to the early modern period (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. \nAround 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer Leon Battista Alberti is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the magic lantern that could project images. \n\nIn the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera. Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken recitation that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes. \n\nPeep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland. Some artists from the 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting, like Pieter Janssens Elinga and Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.\nFrom around 1700 many of these \"perspective boxes\" or \"optica\" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives. From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the zograscope, which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box. \nPeep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the dissolving views that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.\n\nIn the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as \"Holland machines\". They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.\n\n19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including \"la yang p'ien\" (). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with puppets or pictures outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.\nIn Ottoman Syria a form of peep show called \"sanduk al-ajayib\" (\"wonder box\") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. \"Sanduk al-ajayib\" stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell. \n\nOther common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or masques, court ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.\nRaree shows were precursors of toy theatres, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to optical toys like Chinese fireworks, the diorama, the stereoscope and the magic lantern.\n\nSome peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the masques and pageants of their time.\n\nPeep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as \"What the Butler Saw\", since before the turn of the twentieth century. \n\nIn contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of pornographic films or a live sex show which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. \n\nFor live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a striptease and sexually explicit poses. In Barcelona female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include paper towel dispensers, for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a \"private dance\", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.\n\nResearch on peep show establishments in California examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding sex businesses such as peep show establishments and X-rated movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego. Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant. Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.\n\nRegal Show World was an adult entertainment business on lower Market Street in San Francisco, California. The company's slogan was \"Where you are king\". The business had a peep show and an adult video arcade. The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a \"double in the bubble\" show in which two performers worked simultaneously. During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers. At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to unionize and \"signed union authorization cards for representation by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Local 790\".\n\nThe business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a privately held company in San Francisco that was founded in 1990. Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, Market Street Cinema, and the Campus Theater. Bijou Group, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization circa 1994. In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to \"economic reasons\". At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize. The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers \"signed cards calling for a union election\", and the theater was closed.\n\nThe former Lusty Lady peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be unionized. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a worker cooperative.\n\n\n\nRegal Show World\n\n"}

It is more intimate than stage magic because it doesn't require expensive, large-scale stage equipment and can thus be performed closer to the audience and without a stage. Many of the tricks performed by platform magicians are sufficiently angle-sensitive as to make them impossible to perform as micromagic. Most working magicians are parlor/platform magicians.\n\nMany magicians consider the term \"parlor\" to be old-fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians\" by T.A. Waters, \"The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance.\"\n\nParlor, or club, magicians generally work without assistants and within a few miles of their homes (unlike stage magicians, who may have several in their crew – both backstage and on stage – and may travel thousands of miles between jobs). This is because payment is less for parlor magicians (but still generally more than for close-up performers). Performances of this category of magic include civic and fraternal organizations, business groups, private parties, youth groups, church societies, public dinners, and similar venues.\n\nCommon platform magic tricks include the \"Miser's Dream\" (where a seemingly endless supply of coins is produced from thin air), sucker tricks (like the \"die box\", where a giant die is put in a two-compartment box; the magician makes it vanish but the audience believe he simply shifts it to the other compartment; eventually the magician opens both sides of the box and the die is gone; it has appeared in a previously-empty hat); audience participation tricks (like the breakaway wand, where a wand remains rigid for the magician but falls apart every time the volunteer touches it); production effects (like the square circle, in which a bottomless, topless box with a screened front encloses a bottomless, topless cylinder. Both are shown empty and put together again; the magician then produces large quantities of silk scarves, fruit, bottles, and so on from the \"empty\" cylinder, inside the square box); and so on. There are countless effects that could be considered as fitting into this classification.\n\nPlatform magicians are not as well known to the general public as stage magicians such as David Copperfield and Lance Burton. Some better-known ones include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2895199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2895199", "title": "Precursors of film", "text": "Precursors of film\n\nMuch of film as an art form grew out of several earlier traditions in the fields of oral storytelling and literature (relating to the screenplay), theatre (relating to the theatre director/film director, a cast of actors, a production team that can include a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer) and visual art. Especially after the silent film era sound design and music (relating to the soundtrack and film score) became important factors.\n\nThe technology of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of projection, lenses, photography and optics, with sound recording and reproduction becoming an important part of film after the silent film era.\n\nPrecursors of film are often referred to as precinema, or 'pre-cinema'. Terms like these are disliked by several historians, partly because they seem to devalue the individual qualities of these media by presenting them as a small step in the development of a later invention. For instance: the flip book, zoetrope and phenakistiscope are very tactile devices that allow study and play by manipulating the motion by hand, while the projected image in cinema is untangible. It should also be noted that such devices as the zoetrope were not replaced by cinema: they were still used after the breakthrough of film. Furthermore, many early media examples are also part of a tradition that not only shaped cinema, but also home video, video games, computer-generated imagery, virtual reality and much more. The study of early media devices is also part of a wider and less teleological approach called media archaeology.\n\nMany of the precursors of film are also referred to as \"philosophical toys\", or \"optical toys\".\n\nThe earliest projection of images was most likely done in primitive shadowgraphy dating back to prehistory. It evolved into more refined forms of shadow puppetry, mostly with flat jointed cut-out figures which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen. The shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Plato seemed to hint at shadow puppetry in his \"Allegory of the Cave\" (circa 380 BCE) but no other signs of shadow play in ancient Greece are known and Plato's idea was clearly a hypothetical allegory. Shadow puppetry was possibly developed in India around 200 BCE, but also has a long history in Indonesia (records relating to Wayang since 840 CE), Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, China (records since around 1000 CE) and Nepal. It later spread to the Ottoman empire and seems not to have reached Europe before the 17th century. It became very popular in France at the end of the 18th century. Around the time cinema was developed several theaters in Montmartre showed elaborate \"Ombres Chinoises\" shows that were very successful. The famous Le Chat noir produced 45 different shows between 1885 and 1896.\n\nProjection of images can occur naturally when rays of light pass through a small hole and produce an inverted image on a surface in a dark area behind the hole. This phenomenon is known as camera obscura or pinhole image. Its oldest known recorded description is found in Chinese Mohist writings dated to circa 400 BCE. However, people have probably witnessed and made use of occurrences of the phenomenon since prehistoric times. It has been suggested that distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave paintings were possibly based on distortions seen in pinhole images formed through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide. Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits, especially in temple worship, are thought to possibly have been conjured up by means of camera obscura or proto magic lantern projections. \nIn Arab and European science the camera obscura was used in darkened rooms since circa 1000 CE to study light and especially sun eclipses.\n\nVery occasionally the camera obscura was thought of as an instrument for live projections of performances to entertain an audience inside a darkened room. Purportedly Arnaldus de Villa Nova did so at the end of the 13th century. In 1589 Giambattista della Porta imagined how the camera obscura could be used to project hunting scenes, battles, games or anything desired. Real or artificial forests, rivers, mountains as well as animals could be used for scenes on an outside stage and projected into a dark room with spectators.\n\nThe use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project clearer images has been dated back to 1550.\n\nIn 1572, the oldest known suggestion for the camera to become mobile was described as a lightweight wooden hut to be carried around on two wooden poles. More practical solutions followed in the 17th century in the shape of tents and eventually as portable wooden boxes with a viewing pane and a mirror to get an upright image. The camera obscura became increasingly popular as a drawing and painting aid for artists.\n\nThe \"trotting horse lamp\" [走馬燈] has been known in China since before 1000 CE. It is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern and appear to chase each other. Some versions showed more motion with the heads, feet or hands of figures connected with fine iron wire to an extra inner layer and triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. The lamp would typically show images of horses and horse-riders.\n\nSeveral scholars and inventors, like Giovanni Fontana (circa 1420), Leonardo da Vinci (circa 1515) and Cornelis Drebbel (1608) possibly had early image projectors before the invention of the Magic Lantern. Athanasius Kircher's 1645 first edition of \"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae\" included a description of his forerunner to the magic lantern: the \"Steganographic Mirror\". This was a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. Kircher also suggested projecting live flies and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror. The book was widely distributed and may have offered some inspiration for Christiaan Huygens' invention of the magic lantern in 1659.\n\nMoving images were possibly projected with the magic lantern since its invention; Christiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches for slides show a skeleton taking his skull off his neck and placing it back. Techniques to add motion to the painted glass slides were described since circa 1700. These usually involved parts (for instance limbs) painted on one or more extra pieces of glass moved by hand or small mechanisms across a stationary slide which showed the rest of the picture.\n\nIn 1770 Edmé-Gilles Guyot detailed how to project a magic lantern image on smoke to create a transparent, shimmering image of a hovering ghost. This technique was used in the phantasmagoria shows that became very popular in several parts of Europe between 1790 and the 1830s. Other techniques were developed to produce convincing ghost experiences. The lantern was handheld to move the projection across the screen (which was usually an almost invisible transparent screen behind which the lanternist operated hidden in the dark). A ghost could seem to approach the audience or grow larger by moving the lantern towards the screen, sometimes with the lantern on a trolley on rails, just like a tracking shot in films. Multiple lanterns not only could make ghosts move independently, but were also occasionally used for superimposition in the composition of complicated scenes. By experimenting with superimposition dissolving views were invented and became a separate popular magic lantern show, especially in England in the 1830s and 1840s. Dissolving views typically showed a landscape changing from a winter version to a spring or summer variation by slowly diminishing the light from one version while introducing the aligned projection of the other slide. Another use of dissolving views, projected with a triple lantern, showed a sleeping figure while images of dreams were superimposed above its head and dissolved from one scene to another. This is similar to the use of a dissolve in film.\n\nBetween the 1840s and 1870s several abstract magic lantern effects were developed. This included the chromatrope which projected dazzling colorful geometrical patterns by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions.\n\nOccasionally small jointed shadow puppets had been used in phantasmagoria shows. Magic lantern slides with jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels were also produced commercially and patented in 1891. A popular version of these \"Fantoccini slides\" had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet. Named after the Italian word for animated puppets, like marionettes or jumping jacks.\n\nSeveral possible examples of very early sequential images can be found in paleolithic cave paintings, on a 5,200-year old pottery bowl found in Iran and in an Egyptian mural approximately 4000 years old, found in the tomb of Khnumhotep at the Beni Hassan cemetery. However, it is very unlikely that these could be viewed in motion.\n\nThe theory of Thaumatrope induction was presented by Peter Mark Roget in 1824 in his paper \"Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures\". This explained the concept called 'persistence of vision'. Two years later, the first of many gadgets to create the illusion of movement was marketed by John Ayrton Paris. The card, called the \"Thaumatrope\", gave an optical illusion when spun. Michael Faraday also began to experiment with visual illusions at this time, creating a revolving wheel.\nMoving images were produced on revolving drums and disks in the 1830s with independent invention by Simon von Stampfer (Stroboscope) in Austria, Joseph Plateau (Phenakistoscope) in Belgium and William Horner (zoetrope) in Britain. The Zoetrope, a.k.a., the \"Daedalum\" was a revolving cylinder which gave the illusion of motion to the pictures inside. Charles-Émile Reynaud developed an early animation device in 1877, which he called the Praxinoscope.\n\nOther mechanisms followed: in 1832 Joseph Plateau created the Anorthoscope and Phenakistiscope; in 1833 Simon Stampler developed the Stroboscope; in 1853, Franz von Uchatius invented the Kinetoscope which projected moving drawings;\n\nPreceding cinema by thousands of years, plays and dances already included elements like scripts, sets, lighting, costumes, production, direction, actors, audiences, storyboards, and film scores. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism applied, such as mise en scene. However, moving images and sound were not recorded intended for replaying as in film. \n\nPuppetry, another ancient art form, shares elements with animation and claymation.\n\nIn 1740 and 1748, David Hume published \"Treatise of Human Nature\" and \"An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding\", arguing for the associations and causes of ideas with visual images, forerunners to the language of film.\n\nOptics developed during the scientific revolution with a theory of lenses. Photographic film was created in the 19th century. Phonographic recording of sound was invented in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1861 Samuel Goodale patented a hand-turned stereoscope device which rapidly moves stereo images past a viewer; and in the same year Coleman Sellers II built the Kinematoscope - a series of stereoscopic pictures on glass plates, linked together in a chain, and mounted in a box. The simple and convenient flip book was patented in 1868 and has endured as a commercial product.\n\nThe crucial invention of celluloid was made in 1855 by Alexander Parkes, a substance he initially called Parkesine. This was marketed from 1869 by John and Isaiah Hyatt.\n\nThe first real sequence photographed in real-time, rather than consisting of a series of posed photographs, was created in the US in 1878 by British photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Under the sponsorship of Leland Stanford, he photographed a horse named Sallie Gardner in rapid motion by using a series of separate still cameras. The experiment took place on June 15 at Stanford's stock farm in Palo Alto, California, with the press present, and was meant to determine whether a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at the same time. The cameras were arranged in a line parallel to the edge of the track and spaced 27 inches apart. Each camera shutter was triggered by a thread as the horse passed and each exposure was made in only one thousandth of a second. Muybridge would publish many cards, plates and books of his chronopotograph sequences. He also had an artist paint sequences onto a glass disc that could be used to project the images onto a screen with a device he called a zoopraxiscope, which can be regarded as one of the first movie projectors. His innovative process was an intermediate stage toward motion pictures and cinematography.\n\nÉtienne-Jules Marey invented a chronophotographic gun in 1882, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames on the same picture. He used the chronophotographic gun for studying animals and human locomotion. An early projector, along similar lines to Muybridge's zoopraxiscope, was built by Ottomar Anschütz in 1887. His Electrotachyscope used 24 images on a rotating glass disk. In 1894 his invention projected moving images in Berlin.\n\nAs a result of the work of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey, researchers in the late 19th century began to realize that motion picture capture and display was a distinct practical possibility.\nThe Frenchman Louis Le Prince began work on such a project in the 1880s, while working in Leeds, England. Le Prince had been inspired by Muybridge's pioneering experiments, and he patented his first invention, a 16 lens camera, in 1887. The first 8 lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward allowing the other 8 lenses to operate on the film. Although the camera was capable of 'capturing' motion, it wasn't a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint and thus the projected image jumped about.\n\nBy May 1887, after much trial and error, Le Prince was finally able to develop and patent the first single lens camera in 1888, leading to the birth of the modern motion-picture film over the next decade. Le Prince shot the first sequences of moving film in the world, what would become known as \"Roundhay Garden Scene\", shot on October 14, 1888 in Roundhay, Leeds.\n"}
{"id": "726909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=726909", "title": "Problem play", "text": "Problem play\n\nThe problem play is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of realism in the arts, especially following the innovations of Henrik Ibsen. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context. Critic Chris Baldick writes that the genre emerged \"from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts.\" He summarises it as follows:\n\nThe critic F. S. Boas adapted the term to characterise certain plays by William Shakespeare that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any tragicomic dramas that do not fit easily into the classical generic distinction between comedy and tragedy.\n\nWhile plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and satyr plays, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as Alcestis.\n\nF. S. Boas used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were \"Measure for Measure\", \"All's Well That Ends Well\" and \"Troilus and Cressida\". He wrote that \"throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome\". Later critics have used the term for other plays, including \"Timon of Athens\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\".\n\nWhile social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as Alexandre Dumas, fils, who dealt with the subject of prostitution in \"The Lady of the Camellias\" (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, \"No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth.\"\n\nThe most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in \"A Doll's House\" (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in \"Ghosts\" (1882) and provincial greed in \"An Enemy of the People\" (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by George Bernard Shaw and other later dramatists.\n\nThe genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's \"Hindle Wakes\" (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This \"resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle\" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction \"the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment.\"\n\nIn America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as Angelina Weld Grimké's, \"Rachel\". It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's \"Paragraph 218\" (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by Erwin Piscator.\n\n"}

Cecily O'Neill describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as\" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action\", constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches. It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every culture in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an empathetic adult (usually the parent) in role.\n\nProcess drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up scenario. When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, \"How do communities deal with change?\", \"How do we accept other people into our community?\" or themes such as environmental sustainability, betrayal, truth and other ethical and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a pedagogical outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the loggers, people who live in the forest community and environmentalists. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the \"other\" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic. Process drama does what the character Atticus Finch advocates: the ability to work for social justice comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to \"try on\" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.\n\nProcess drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.\n"}
{"id": "156593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156593", "title": "Puppetry", "text": "Puppetry\n\nPuppetry is a form of theatre or performance that involves the manipulation of puppets – inanimate objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a puppeteer. Such a performance is also known as a . The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in storytelling.\n\nThere are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are finger puppets, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and sock puppets, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's \"mouth\". A hand puppet is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around (Punch and Judy puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A \"live-hand puppet\" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. Marionettes are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.\n\nPuppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years BC. Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as sacred objects in rituals, as symbolic effigies in celebrations such as carnivals, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in transformative arts.\nPuppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago. Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies. Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre. There is evidence that they were used in Egypt as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread. Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and ivory have also been found in Egyptian tombs. Hieroglyphs also describe \"walking statues\" being used in ancient Egyptian religious dramas. Puppetry was practiced in ancient Greece and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of Herodotus and Xenophon, dating from the 5th century BCE.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt. Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and masks) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies. Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and masked performance. In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.\n\nThere is slight evidence for puppetry in the Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC. Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases. The epic \"Mahabharata\", Tamil literature from the Sangam Era, and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including Ashokan edicts, describe puppets. Works like the \"Natya Shastra\" and the \"Kamasutra\" elaborate on puppetry in some detail.\n\nThe Javanese \"Wayang\" theater was influenced by Indian traditions. Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in Sanskrit plays was known as \"Sutradhara\", \"the holder of strings\". \"Wayang\" is a strong tradition of puppetry native of Indonesia, especially in Java & Bali. In Java, wayang kulit, an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is Wayang golek.\n\nChina has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in \"pi-yung xi\", the \"theatre of the lantern shadows\", or, as it is more commonly known today, Chinese shadow theatre. By the Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.\nIn Taiwan, budaixi puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, somersaults in the air.\n\nJapan has many forms of puppetry, including the bunraku. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. Chikamatsu Monzaemon, considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience. The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.\n\nIn Korea, the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King. In Korean, the word for puppet is \"Kkoktugakshi\". \"Gagsi\" means a \"bride\" or a \"young woman\", which was the most common form the dolls took. A kkoktugakshi puppet play has eight scenes.\n\nThailand has Hun Krabok, a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.\n\nVietnam developed the art form of water puppetry, that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.\n\nIndia has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic \"Mahabharata\" there are references to puppets. The Rajasthani Puppet from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, Ramdas Padhye, subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.\n\n\nIndia has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed. The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.\n\n\nIndia has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Tholpavakoothu (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of shadow puppetry that is unique to Kerala, India. The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.\n\nRod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. \nGlove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.\n\nThe tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the \"dholak\"with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.\n\nAfghanistan has produced a form of puppetry known as buz-baz. During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a markhor while playing a dambura.\n\nMiddle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. Karagoz, the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the Mongols from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to Anatolia by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from Egypt. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when Yavuz Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in Istanbul where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent, developed an interest in the plays.\n\nIn other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as \"khayal al-zill\", a metaphor translated as \"shadows of the imagination\" or \"shadow of fancy\", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, \"the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also...\"special effects\" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience\"\n\nIn Iran, puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular . Other genres of puppetry emerged during the Qajar era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. \"Kheimeh Shab-Bazi\" is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a storyteller called a \"morshed\" or \"naghal\". These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (\"Ghahve-Khane\"). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets. A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera \"Rostam and Sohrab\".\n\nAlthough there are few remaining examples of puppets from ancient Greece, historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The Greek word translated as \"puppet\" is \"νευρόσπαστος\" (\"nevrospastos\"), which literally means \"drawn by strings, string-pulling\", from \"νεῦρον\" (\"nevron\"), meaning either \"sinew, tendon, muscle, string\", or \"wire\", and \"σπάω\" (\"spaō\"), meaning \"draw, pull\". Aristotle referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs. Plato's work also contains references to puppetry. The \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the \"common people\" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of Dionysus at the Acropolis.\n\nIn ancient Greece and ancient Rome clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.\n\nItaly is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. Xenophon and Plutarch refer to them. The Christian church used marionettes to perform morality plays. It is believed that the word marionette originates from the little figures of the Virgin Mary, hence the word \"marionette\" or \"Mary doll. Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more ribald and slapstick. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called Commedia dell'arte. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes Shakespeare's plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.\n\nIn Sicily, the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as \"The Song of Roland\". These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called \"Opera dei pupi\", or \"Opera of the puppets\". The \"Opera dei pupi\" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition, in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century.\n\nThe 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in aristocratic circles, as a celebration of the Age of Enlightenment. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice. In the 19th century, the marionettes of Pietro Radillo became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.\n\nGuignol is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent Lyon troupe: \"Guignol amuses children… and witty adults\". Laurent Mourguet, Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice dentistry, which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.\nHis first shows featured Polichinelle, a character borrowed from the Italian commedia dell'arte. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the gendarme Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.\n\nThe traditional British \"Punch and Judy\" puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian commedia dell'arte. The character of \"Punch\" derives from the character Pulcinella, which was Anglicized to \"Punchinello\". He is a manifestation of the Lord of Misrule and Trickster, figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally \"Joan\", but later became \"Judy\". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar \"Punch and Judy\" puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable booth. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and Waldo Lanchester, both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in Malvern, Worcestershire, regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of George Bernard Shaw. One of Shaw's last plays, \"Shakes versus Shav\", was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.\n\nFrom 1957-1969, Gerry Anderson produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with Roberta Leigh's \"The Adventures of Twizzle\" and ending with \"The Secret Service\". Many of these series (the most famous of which was \"Thunderbirds\") employed a technique called Supermarionation, which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with \"Terrahawks\" and the unaired pilot \"Space Police\" in 1987.\n\nCurrent British puppetry theatres include the Little Angel Theatre in Islington, London, Puppet Theatre Barge in London, Norwich Puppet Theatre, the Harlequin Puppet Theatre, Rhos-on-Sea, Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, Biggar, Lanarkshire, Scotland. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. Don Austen, a British puppeteer, worked with Jim Henson's Creature Shop, and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including Horse and Bamboo Theatre, and Green Ginger, which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political satire in the British television series \"Spitting Image\". Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including \"Warhorse\", at the Royal National Theatre and \"Madam Butterfly\" at the English National Opera.\n\nMany regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is \"Jan Klaassen\" (and Judy is \"Katrijn\"); in Denmark \"Mester Jackel\"; in Russia \"Petrushka\"; and in Romania \"Vasilache\". In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.\nThere is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian commedia dell'arte. The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called Kasperle of Kaspar while Judy is called Grete. In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. Gluck, Haydn, de Falla and Respighi all composed adult operas for marionettes.\n\nIn 1855, Count Franz Pocci founded the Munich Marionette Theatre. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. Albrecht Roser has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in Stuttgart. His characters \"Clown Gustaf\" and \"Grandmother\" are well-known. \"Grandmother\", while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.\n\nIn Lindau, the Lindau Marionette Opera was founded in 2000 by Bernard Leismueller and Ralf Hechelmann. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, \"Swan Lake\".\n\nIn Augsburg, the historic Augsburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1943 by Walter Oehmichen. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, Klaus Marschall and Juergen Marschall.\n\nMuch earlier in nearby Salzburg, Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1913 by Professor Anton Aicher and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of Gretl Aicher. It performs mainly operas such as \"Die Fledermaus\" and \"The Magic Flute\" and a small number of ballets such as \"The Nutcracker\". The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.\n\nThere is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.\n\nMarionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in Prague, and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages. Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War. The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre. Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer, and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.\n\nIn 1920 and 1926 respectively, Josef Skupa created his most famous puppet characters: comical father Spejbl and his rascal son Hurvínek. In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre. An important puppet organisation is the National Marionette Theatre in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of Mozart's opera \"Don Giovanni\". The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky (\"Cakes and Puppets\"), founded by Marek Bečka. Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946. Jiří Trnka was an acknowledged leader in this area. Miroslav Trejtnar is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.\n\nThroughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies. In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as vaudeville and music hall, but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.\n\nThe Teotihuacan culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. Native Americans also used ceremonial puppets.\nIn 1519, two puppeteers accompanied Hernando Cortez on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in North America.\n\nDuring the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals, working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.\n\nSome advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the United States. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with Howdy Doody of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. Bil Baird worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, Cora Eisenberg had their own marionette theatre in New York. Ventriloquist, Edgar Bergen also made a major contribution. In the 1960s Peter Schumann's Bread and Puppet Theater developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, Jim Henson was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as Muppets. Initially, through the children's television show \"Sesame Street\", and later in \"The Muppet Show\" and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. Wayland Flowers also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, Madame.\n\nSid and Marty Krofft are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely HR Puffinstuff and Lidsville\n\nPuppets also have been used in the \"Star Wars\" films, notably with the character of Yoda. His voice and manipulation was provided by Frank Oz.\n\nThe Aboriginal peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.\n\nIn Australia in the 1960s, Peter Scriven founded the Marionette Theatre of Australia and had beautiful marionette productions such as The Tintookies, Little Fella Bindi, The Explorers and The Water Babies. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by Barbara Turnbull and her husband Bill Turnbull (puppeteer) toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane. David Poulton toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.\n\nDavid Hamilton, one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster Jamie Dunn was famous for his Muppet-style character, Agro (puppet) who featured on several Seven Network television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the United States by puppeteers from the Jim Henson Company, Brett Hansen and his Brisbane based Larrikin Puppets company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. Cabaret Puppet Theatre, based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults. In Melbourne Handspan Theatre 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.\nA post-graduate course existed at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer Norman Hetherington was famous for his marionette, Mr. Squiggle who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from \"squiggles\" sent in by children from around the country. Richard Bradshaw OAM is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of UNIMA Australia, former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.\n\nRod Hull also made a contribution with his puppet Emu. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. Snuff Puppets is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in Melbourne, their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.\n\nFrom early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, Heinrich von Kleist wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the \"lack of self-consciousness\" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.\n\nSergei Obraztsov explored the concept of \"kukolnost\" ('puppetness'), despite Joseph Stalin's insistence on realism.\nOther pioneers, including Edward Gordon Craig and Erwin Piscator were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. Maeterlinck, Shaw, Lorca and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as Picasso, Jarry, and Léger began to work in theatre. Craig's concept of the \"übermarionette\"—in which the director treats the actors like objects—has been highly influential on contemporary \"object theatre\" and \"physical theatre\". Tadeusz Kantor frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.\n\nKantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as Richard Foreman and Robert Wilson who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms \"putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it\" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as Tony Sarg, Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, Bil Baird, Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, Peter Schumann, Dattatreya Aralikatte, Jim Henson, Dadi Pudumjee, and Julie Taymor have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of Bread and Puppet Theatre, Bob Frith of Horse and Bamboo Theatre, and Sandy Speiler of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.\n\nThe Jim Henson Foundation, founded by puppeteer and Muppet creator Jim Henson, is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists. Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in Boise, Idaho continue the avant garde satirical tradition for millennials.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44737911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44737911", "title": "Salus-Grady libel law", "text": "Salus-Grady libel law\n\nThe Salus-Grady libel law, also known as the Pennsylvania anti-cartoon law, was enacted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1903 to discourage political criticism from the press. Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker championed the controversial law in response to an ongoing set of cartoons that mocked his successful 1902 gubernatorial campaign and his tenure as governor. Upset by being caricatured as a parrot, Pennypacker denounced what he deemed \"the sensational devices and the disregard of truth\" employed by the press. The law broadened the circumstances under which a newspaper could be sued for libel, and made editors liable in their personal capacity to such lawsuits. Rather than having the chilling effect Pennypacker desired, the law backfired spectacularly. Charles Nelan and other artists drew cartoons more contemptuous than the previous ones, and nationally circulating newspapers joined the Pennsylvanian newspapers in protesting against the law. The law languished along with Pennypacker when he stepped down from office in 1907, as his successor quickly repealed the controversial measure.\nThe start of the 20th century coincided with an increasingly vocal press and journalists who targeted their subjects with editorial cartoons and investigative reports. Feeling threatened, politicians in several states proposed laws that would place restrictions upon these unflattering images. The conflict between journalist and political figure would come to a head in Pennsylvania when the Republican Party nominated Samuel W. Pennypacker, then a sitting judge in Philadelphia, for the office of governor. Pennypacker's short temper and arrogance made him an easy target. Although he was perceived as an honest judge, Pennypacker refused to acknowledge the corruption present in Pennsylvania's political environment, declaring that the government had \"no ills that are worthy of mention.\" Pennypacker strongly defended the party boss, Matthew S. Quay, and attributed his nomination not to Quay's behind-the-scenes maneuvering, but to the strength of his own record as a judge. He saw his own nomination as an unprecedented achievement of honest politics.\n\nCharles Nelan, a cartoonist working for the anti-Quay \"North American\" newspaper out of Philadelphia, capitalized on the candidate's remarks by drawing him as a conceited parrot. Referencing the parrot's propensity for mimicry, the caricatured bird repeated the words of party elders: metaphorically, Nelan accused Pennypacker of being a rubber stamp for the desires of Quay and his cronies. Later cartoons similarly implied that the judge was tainted by his association with Quay, but Pennypacker won the governor's race anyway. Despite his victory, Pennypacker harbored ill will against the cartoonists, with his inaugural address criticizing \"sensational journals\" as a \"terror to the household, a detriment to the public service, and an impediment to the courts of justice.\"\n\nThe Salus-Grady libel law was preceded by an unsuccessful bill introduced by Frederick Taylor Pusey to ban \"any cartoon or caricature or picture portraying, describing or representing any person, either by distortion, innuendo or otherwise, in the form or likeness of beast, bird, fish, insect, or other unhuman animal, thereby tending to expose such person to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\" But the legislators did not count on the ingenuity of the cartoonists who immediately began ridiculing Governor Pennypacker and other officials with caricatures in the guise of vegetables and inanimate objects. Politicians were depicted as turnips, trees, chestnut burrs, squash, beer steins, and other non-animal forms. Philadelphia's \"North American\" newspaper proposed a new coat of arms for Pennsylvania featuring an impaled cartoonist's head, a gag and muzzle, a dwarf on a stool, a pussy cat, and a jackass in knee-high boots. State representative Samuel W. Salus and state senator John C. Grady took a different approach, proposing that newspaper editors be made liable in their personal capacity to libel lawsuits, and their bill was passed. The law was never enforced, and Pennypacker was hounded for his entire term as governor by critical cartoons. After his predecessor's term was finished, the new administration of Governor Edwin Sydney Stuart swiftly rescinded the law.\n\n"}
{"id": "7288221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7288221", "title": "Sasuke (TV series)", "text": "Sasuke (TV series)\n\nSasuke (サスケ; stylized in Japan as SASUKE) is a Japanese sports entertainment television special in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage obstacle course. An edited version, named Ninja Warrior, is screened in at least 18 other countries.\n\nRecorded on location at Midoriyama studio in Yokohama, it airs on Tokyo Broadcasting System between Japanese television drama seasons. The show's name \"Sasuke\" is named after Sarutobi Sasuke, a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling. Each three-hour special (with the exception of \"Sasuke\" 24 which lasted 5 hours) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 35 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, except in 2017). The show is produced by TBS and is one of the spin-offs of , another sports entertainment competition, which aired on G4 under the name \"Unbeatable Banzuke\". Until the 10th competition, \"Sasuke\" was broadcast as a special part of \"Muscle Ranking\", but it became an independent program when \"Muscle Ranking\" was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time \"Sasuke\" did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness. After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to \"Sasuke\", TBS renamed the show Sasuke Rising for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS renamed the show once again Sasuke Ninja Warrior since the 35th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. \"Sasuke\" consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in \"Sasuke\" 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 35 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were in the 4th competition (1999), Makoto Nagano in the 17th competition (2006), Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st competition (2015).\n\nThe popularity of \"Sasuke\" has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. \"Kunoichi\", perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of \"Sasuke\" restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n\"American Ninja Warrior\" is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with \"Sasuke\" (with American finalists participating on the \"Sasuke\" course in Japan), it was at one point the G4 network's highest rated show. As of season 4, \"American Ninja Warrior\"'s popularity has allowed it to move to the NBC network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter \"Sasuke\" even after the inception of \"ANW\".\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France (TF1), Germany (RTL), Italy (NOVE of Discovery Networks) in 2016, and Israel (Keshet Media Group) . An Australian version launched on Nine Network in July 2017. Netflix also started airing \"Ultimate Beastmaster\", broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a \"Sasuke\" inspired show.\n\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, Bulgaria, China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.\n\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the \"Sasuke\" course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.\n\nThe six consisted of:\n\n\n† – Nagano touched the top of the Shin-Cliffhanger after swinging from the second to the third ledge. He disqualified himself, admitting his error and bowing out after he reached the next platform.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> – Nagano was allowed a second attempt at the First Stage due to a malfunction of the Slider Jump.\n\n\n† – Takeda had no number in the 18th tournament. He was around the 86th person to run the course.\n\n† – Yamamoto was hurt in the 7th competition when he dislocated his shoulder and in the 23rd he re-injured his shoulder.\n\n\n\n† – In the 12th competition, Yamada was disqualified on the Spider Walk for failing to remove his gloves used on the Chain Reaction obstacle. \nAlthough he was disqualified, he did manage to clear the 2nd Stage with 3.4 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Sasuke New Stars (in contrast to the All stars) are new younger competitors who have made a name for themselves on the recent editions of the course. \"Shin Sedai\" or New Stars became famous since \"Sasuke\" 17, after Shunsuke Nagasaki made it to the Final Stage. There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in \"Sasuke\" 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage. Membership in the New Stars has included the following:\n\n\n\n\n† – Kanno touched part of the frame with his foot and climbed along the side of the platform, thereby going off the course.\n‡ – Kanno withdrew before Double Salmon Ladder because of a shoulder injury.\n†† – Kanno dislocated his shoulder immediately after clearing the Warped Wall, and timed out on top of the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n† – Kishimoto did not run the course because of his back injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld-class athletes, including Olympians, have attempted \"Sasuke\":\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in \"Sasuke\" over the years, including professional team handball player Daisuke Miyazaki, who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in \"Sasuke\" 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In \"Sasuke\" 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in \"Sasuke\" 26, he failed the First Stage Rolling Escargot.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: Tomoko Hagiwara, Koki Sakamoto, and Daisuke Nakano. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic gymnasts (and twin brothers) Paul and Morgan Hamm, have competed in \"Sasuke\". Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further – in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\nDecathlete Paul Terek competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of \"Pro Sportsman No. 1\" in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd \"American Ninja Challenge\" competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in \"Sasuke\" 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to \"Sasuke\" in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in \"Sasuke\" 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\nHenry Cejudo, gold medal-winning wrestler at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a free runner from G4's \"American Ninja Challenge 2\", first competed in \"Sasuke\" 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in \"\", a televised professional parkour tournament.\n\nLevi did not compete in \"American Ninja Warrior\" 3 to try to earn a spot for \"Sasuke\" 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.\n\nLevi however did compete \"American Ninja Warrior\" 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.\n\nHe has not competed in \"American Ninja Warrior\" ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.\nIn the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.\n\n\n\n† - Hamm cleared the Second Stage with 0.1 seconds left, but walked through the gates without hitting the buzzer and as a result, was disqualified.\n\n\n\n† - Levi was supposed to compete in the 26th tournament, having earned a spot in the \"American Ninja Warrior\" preliminaries, but was ultimately unable to do so after breaking his wrist on \"\", which occurred prior to the 26th tournament. His spot in the tournament went to ANW alternate, Adam LaPlante (who failed on the Halfpipe Attack in Stage 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulgarian gymnast and six-time Olympian (1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012) Yordan Yovchev (spelled on G4 as Jordan Jovtchev) first competed in the 8th competition. During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in \"Sasuke\" 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again. He also competed in \"Sasuke\" 23, where he managed to pass all of the other obstacles but sadly timed out on the final rope ladder.\n\n\nSouth Korean gymnast Yeo Hong-chul, silver medalist in the men's vault at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He competed four times but has never gotten past the First Stage. In the 7th competition, he was unable to beat the Rolling Log; In the 8th, he failed the Quintuple Step; In the 11th, he timed out on the Warped Wall. And in the 12th, he timed out on the Rope Climb.\n\nSpanish gymnast Gervasio Deferr, 2000 and 2004 Olympic Champion in the vault and 2008 silver medalist in the floor exercise, competed in the 10th competition but timed out a few feet from the buzzer on the First Stage's Rope Climb.\n\n\n\nK-1 mixed martial artist Genki Sudo has competed in five tournaments, failing at the Jump Hang (6th, 12th), the Rolling Log (13th), Duodectuple Step (23rd), and the Log Grip (24th). Another mixed martial artist, Sanae Kikuta competed in the 8th and 10th tournaments, where he fell off of the Rolling Log in the First Stage; in the 12th tournament, he fell on the Plank Bridge in the First Stage.

He had a surprising fail on the modified Fish Bone (35th).\n\nFormer Pride Fighting Championships and Pancrase Japanese mixed martial artist and pro wrestler Ikuhisa Minowa, competing in DREAM known as \"Minowaman\", was featured in the 26th competition wearing red wrestling tights, pads, and boots. He failed the second obstacle, \"Hazard Swing\" after jumping from the swing, and missing the rope on the platform, falling into the water below. He also competed in the 29th competition, but failed the first obstacle, the \"Long Jump\", where he landed feet first onto the sandbox and jumped backwards into the water. Japanese featherweight mixed martial artist from DREAM Hideo Tokoro (announced as a \"freelance fighter\") was featured right after Minowaman in the 26th competition where he failed to grab the rope to swing himself to the other side in the first obstacle \"Step Slider\".\n\nSeveral professional wrestlers have also competed, including Tiger Mask, The Great Sasuke (referred to as \"Great Ninja Warrior\" in the US and UK versions), Minoru Suzuki, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Kota Ibushi and Naohiro Hoshikawa. Suzuki and Tanahashi were the Triple Crown Heavyweight and IWGP Heavyweight Champion, respectively, during their runs in the course.\n\nSeveral Japanese or Japan-based entertainers have taken part in \"Sasuke\", including action movie star Kane Kosugi and his brother Shane. Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition. He reached the Final Stage in the 8th competition, becoming, alongside Yordan Yovchev, the first foreigner to make it that far. Competing in heavy rain, Kane timed out on the Rope Climb; he has not competed since. Shane timed out on the Second Stage's Wall Lift in the 2nd competition, then failed the First Stage's Rolling Log in the 3rd competition. In the 4th, he came close to completing the First Stage but timed out on the Rope Climb. In the 6th and 7th competitions, he made it to the Third Stage, failing both times on the Body Prop. In the 8th competition, he failed to get past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Unlike his brother, Shane competed in the 9th competition, where he failed the Big Boulder in the First Stage.\n\nOther entertainers who have competed include , host of several NHK children's programs; Shigeyuki Nakamura, a champion of the Muscle Gym event in \"Kinniku Banzuke\"; actor-singer Kazumi Morohoshi, a former member of the band Hikaru Genji who is now a solo artist; actor/announcer Kenjirō Ishimaru; and actors Masaki Nomura and Shōei.

Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. Shōei competed three times.

He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in \"Sasuke\" 30. In \"Sasuke\" 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orugōru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.\n\nVoice actress Tomoko Kaneda competed in \"Sasuke\" 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband Wataru Mori, an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since \"Sasuke\" 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in \"Sasuke\" 20 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in \"Sasuke\" 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in \"Sasuke\" 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In \"Sasuke\" 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in \"Sasuke\" 35.\n\nGolden Bomber members Kenji Darvish and Yutaka Kyan also competed in \"Sasuke\" 31. Kyan failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Darvish had previously competed in \"Sasuke\" 28 and 30 and failed the First Stage. In \"Sasuke\" 31, he finally completed the First Stage and failed the Cross Slider in the Second Stage.

In \"Sasuke\" 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In \"Sasuke\" 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting in \"Sasuke\" 35.\n\nModel Shimon Okura competed in \"Sasuke\" 30. He failed on the Log Grip on the First Stage. He came again to \"Sasuke\" 31, doing better on the Log Grip, but he missed the nets on the Jump Hang Kai. Then he joined \"Sasuke\" 32. He fell on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he tried to get to the red sandbag.\n\nA.B.C-Z member Ryoichi Tsukada competed in \"Sasuke\" 31; he timed out at the Lumberjack Climb. Then, he competed again on \"Sasuke\" 32. He completed the new obstacle Tie Fighter and Double Pendulum, but he failed to reach the top of the Warped Wall. In \"Sasuke\" 33, he cleared the First Stage for the first time. He failed Salmon Ladder Up. Johnny's Jr. Hikaru Iwamoto failed the transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill. He failed on the TIE Fighter in \"Sasuke\" 35.\n\nSeveral Japanese comedians have taken part in \"Sasuke\", including (\"The Monkey\"), Koriki Choshu (\"the most famous gut in Japan\" and 2nd on G4's Craziest Contestants Poll), Passion Yara (\"screaming wacko\" and 5th on G4s craziest contestants poll), Masaki Sumitani (\"Razor Ramon H.G.\" or \"Hard Gay\"), Yoku Hata (\"Guitar Samurai\"), Tetsurō Degawa, and . Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges – for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st–3rd competitions), a record that is shared with \"Sasuke\" all-star Makoto Nagano, but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in \"Sasuke\" 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include Yoshio Kojima, who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26–28), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman Masumi Yagi was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian Eiko Kano (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian competed nine times in \"Sasuke\". He debuted in \"Sasuke\" 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In \"Sasuke\" 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In \"Sasuke\" 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In \"Sasuke\" 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for \"Sasuke\" 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In \"Sasuke\" 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in \"Sasuke\" 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in \"Sasuke\" 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in \"Sasuke\" 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the late action star, which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n45-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-\"Sasuke\" tournament (except \"Sasuke\" 22), starting with \"Sasuke\" 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former \"Super Sentai\" stuntwoman Chie Nishimura, who did so in the 2nd tournament. She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in \"Sasuke\" 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in \"Sasuke\" since.\n\nAll three women who achieved \"kanzenseiha\" on \"Kunoichi\" \"(Women of Ninja Warrior)\", the female equivalent of \"Sasuke\", have also competed in \"Sasuke\" itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican gymnast Kacy Catanzaro, who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during \"American Ninja Warrior\" qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for \"Sasuke\" 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and \"American Ninja Warrior\" standout, stuntwoman Jessie Graff – the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (\"ANW All-Stars\") – was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in \"Sasuke\" 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in \"Sasuke\" history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in \"Sasuke\". In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament.\n\nIn fall 2007, the G4 network held a contest called the \"American Ninja Challenge\", whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in \"Sasuke\" 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's \"Attack of the Show!\" on August 28–30 to demonstrate their \"Ninja Warrior\" skills. On August 31, Michigan State University Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, Greenville, South Carolina native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's \"Ninjafest\". Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's \"Ninjafest 2\" on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in \"Sasuke\" 20th tournament; both are free runners. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's \"Ninjafest 3\" on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in \"Sasuke\" 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg – the first woman to qualify – of Valley Village, California. They joined \"American Ninja Challenge\" 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from \"Attack of the Show!\", Olivia Munn and Kevin Pereira, to compete in \"Sasuke\" 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe ulnar nerve injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of \"Ninjafest 4\". The competitors' videos were judged by \"Attack of the Show\" Olivia Munn. The winner, David Campbell, was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 Jessie Graff went on to compete in \"Sasuke\" 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1–100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on \"Sasuke\". All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\nAired: September 26, 1998\n\nAired: March 13, 1999\n\nAired: October 16, 1999\n\nAired: March 18, 2000\n\nAired: September 9, 2000\n\nNote: This is the first tournament where no one failed the Second Stage.\n\nAired: March 17, 2001\n\n^Went 2 1/2 meters up then fell down.\n\nAired: September 29, 2001\n\n^ Jovtchev fell off the Spider Climb after the walls split at the 15 second limit.\n\nAired: March 16, 2002\n\nAired: September 25, 2002\n\nAired: March 21, 2003\n\nAired: October 1, 2003\n\nAired: April 6, 2004\n\nAired: January 4, 2005\n\nAired: July 20, 2005\n\nAired: December 30, 2005\n\nAired: October 11, 2006\n\nAired: March 21, 2007\n\nAired: September 19, 2007\n\nNote: This is the first tournament where nobody cleared the Second Stage, marking the earliest end of a tournament.\n\nAired: March 26, 2008\n\nAired: September 17, 2008\n\nAired: March 30, 2009\n\nAired: September 27, 2009\n\nAired: January 1, 2010\n\nAired: March 28, 2010\n\nAired: January 2, 2011\n\nAired: October 3, 2011\n\nAired: December 27, 2012\n\nAired: June 27, 2013\n\nAired: July 3, 2014\n\nAired: July 1, 2015\n\nAired: July 3, 2016\n\nNote: This is the second tournament where no one failed the Second Stage.\n\nAired: March 26, 2017\n\nAired: October 8, 2017\n\nAired : March 26, 2018\n\nOne hundred participants are given the opportunity to attempt the First Stage, a course which primarily tests one's speed. The object is to hit the buzzer at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th \"Sasuke\" competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being \"Sasuke\" All-Stars), a record in \"Sasuke\" history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first \"Kunoichi\", where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n+ — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock. From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. \"Sasuke\"\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a \"Sasuke\" competition.\n\n+ — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n+ — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\nTo date, the Final Stage has known six forms. Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as \"kanzenseiha\" (), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on \"Ninja Warrior\" as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated \"Sasuke\" in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15 meter (49 ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to . It consists of a Spider Climb followed by a Rope Climb. After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared Yordan Yovtchev during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20 meter (66 ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5 meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of \"Sasuke Rising\". Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4 m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18–24 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7–17 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24 m. The Spider Climb (スパイダークライム) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5 m, while the Rope Climb (綱登り) was slightly modified in length at 11.5 m from that of its original predecessor, at 10 m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35 second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was ¥2,000,000 (about US$). The prize has now increased to ¥4,000,000 (about US$) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a Nissan Fuga was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of the international versions with their own \"Sasuke\"/\"Ninja Warrior\" courses, excluding the original Japanese version and its rebroadcast in other countries.\n\nThese winners are not including the \"kanzenseiha\" (Total Victory) winners from the original Japanese version, or under any other varied rules (including \"Team Ninja Warrior\" in Denmark and the United States).\n\nThe program previously aired on G4 in the United States under the name Ninja Warrior. Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese play-by-play commentary and interviews with the competitors have English subtitles, while the competitor profiles, replays, and introductions were dubbed by voice actor Dave Wittenberg.\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of \"Ninja Warrior\" stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the Esquire Network on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if \"Ninja Warrior\" would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show \"American Ninja Warrior\" to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by \"USA Today\" says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\"\n\nThe popularity of the \"American Ninja Challenge\" has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called \"American Ninja Warrior\", which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by Akbar Gbaja-Biamila and Matt Iseman. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by \"Sasuke\" First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n\"American Ninja Warrior\" aired only the American finalists during the \"Sasuke\" obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA second season was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in \"Sasuke\" 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals. This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the \"Sasuke\" obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider). The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the \"Sasuke\" course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the \"Sasuke\" competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former \"American Gladiators\" champion and gladiator Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. David Campbell, despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, \"Sasuke\" 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe third season of \"American Ninja Warrior\" debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time \"Sasuke\" veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard, Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and \"\" competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow \"Jump City: Seattle\" competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from \"Jump City\" who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan , second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time \"Sasuke\" veteran Brian Orosco all saw their \"Sasuke\" dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to \"Sasuke\", nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for \"Sasuke\" 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, David Campbell almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 K-Swiss Endorsement Deal, the competitors at \"Sasuke\" 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA fourth season of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted \"American Ninja Warrior\" title. The entire format was changed as well – regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its fifth season on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its sixth season on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and Esquire Network with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its seventh season in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during \"Sasuke\" 34.) The network has renewed the show once again for its eighth season in 2016 with new qualifying cities including Los Angeles and Oklahoma City. The network has renewed the show for its ninth season in 2017 with three new cities: San Antonio, Daytona Beach, and Cleveland. The tenth season of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall.\n\nIn 2014, the first \"Sasuke\"-based team competition was started, pitting five \"Sasuke\" All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five \"American Ninja Warrior\" stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural \"Sasuke\"/\"Ninja Warrior\" world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in Aoba-ku in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from \"Sasuke\", while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from \"American Ninja Warrior\". The match was composed of four rounds – one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6–0 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\nWith the success of \"American Ninja Warrior\", Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called \"Team Ninja Warrior\" on October 9, 2015. The spin-off consists of 24 teams of three members featuring past and current \"ANW\" contestants from the first seven seasons.

The \"Ninja Killer\" and \"Warrior Wipeout\" sections remain, but there is only one advertisement break halfway through the show.\n\nThe show was voiced-over by Stuart Hall for its first three series, aired between 2007 and 2008. In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over. Challenge has now removed Hall's commentary from the first three series, following his imprisonment in June 2013, and re-dubbed them with new commentary by North.

{"id": "143196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143196", "title": "The Beatles Anthology", "text": "The Beatles Anthology\n\nThe Beatles Anthology is a television documentary, a three-volume set of double albums, and a book focusing on the history of the Beatles. Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all participated in the making and approval of the works, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"Anthology\" project, while John Lennon had archival interviews.\n\nThe documentary series was first broadcast in November 1995, with expanded versions released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1996 and on DVD in 2003. The documentary used interviews with the Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances. The \"Anthology\" book, released in 2000, paralleled the documentary in presenting the group's history through quotes from interviews.\n\nThe initial volume of the album set (\"Anthology 1\") was released the same week of the documentary's airdate, with the subsequent two volumes (\"Anthology 2\" and \"Anthology 3\") released in 1996. They included unreleased performances and outtakes presented in roughly chronological order, along with two new songs based on demo tapes recorded by Lennon after the group broke up: \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", both produced by Jeff Lynne.\n\nApproximately coinciding with the release of the \"Free as a Bird\" single and \"Anthology 1\" album (the first of three double-CD albums), \"The Beatles Anthology\" series of documentaries was broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom and ABC television in the United States in 1995. The \"Anthology\" series takes a form similar to that of the \"Anthology\" book, by being a series of first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external \"objective\" narration. Footage in the \"Anthology\" series features voice-over recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others. As well as telling their story through archival footage, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series; John Lennon appears only in historic archival footage. The Beatles' wives, past and present, do not appear (excluding archival footage such as video from India and the music video for Harrison's song \"Something\").\n\nThe series, which was made over five thousand hours of planning and production, is composed of numerous film clips and interviews that present a complete history of the band from the Beatles' own personal perspectives. When it aired on ABC, the series comprised six hour-long programs, aired on three nights in November 1995. The series was later released, as eight expanded episodes, on VHS, laserdisc and as a boxed set of five DVDs (4 discs with 2 episodes apiece and a disc of extras).\n\nAir dates on ABC:\n\n\nPart 1 of the series drew 17 million households, meaning an average of 27.3 million viewers, which was much better than usual for ABC at the time, but behind most broadcasts of \"Friends\" on NBC, which in its second season was averaging 29.4 million viewers per episode.\n\nIn promoting the series during this time, ABC identified itself as \"A-Beatles-C\" – an homage to the mid-1960s Cousin Felica-era \"77 W-A-Beatles-C\" call sign of the network's flagship NYC AM radio station – and several of the network's prime-time sitcoms replaced their regular opening credit themes with Beatles tracks.\n\nTo accompany the \"Anthology\" series, three albums were issued, each containing two CDs or three vinyl LPs of mostly never-before-released Beatles material (the exceptions being the Tony Sheridan-era material), although many of the tracks had appeared on bootlegs for many years prior.\n\nTwo days after the first television special in the series had aired, \"Anthology 1\" was released to stores, and included music recorded by the Quarrymen, the famous Decca Records audition tapes, and various out-takes and demos from the band's first four albums. It also included the song \"Lend Me Your Comb\", omitted from the collection \"Live at the BBC\", released the previous year (1994). The song \"Free as a Bird\" was included at the very start. 450,000 copies of \"Anthology 1\" were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever. The band's first drummer Pete Best, replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962 before the Beatles recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.\n\n\"Anthology 2\" was released on 17 March 1996. The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for \"Help!\", \"Rubber Soul\", \"Revolver\", \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour\". These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", previously available only to bootleg collectors. The new song \"Real Love\" – which, like \"Free as a Bird\", was based on an unfinished Lennon recording – was also included in the two-CD collection.\n\n\"Anthology 3\" was released on 28 October 1996. The third collection featured out-takes and demos from \"The Beatles\" (\"White Album\"), \"Abbey Road\" and \"Let It Be\", as well as several songs from Harrison and McCartney which later became post-Beatle tracks.\n\nThe three album covers, when laid side-by-side, become one long painted collage of various peeling posters and album covers representing the different stages of the Beatles' career. This was the work of Klaus Voormann, who also created the album cover for \"Revolver\" in 1966. The \"Anthology\" covers required Voormann to recreate elements of his cover for \"Revolver\" within the collage. During the music video for \"Free as a Bird\", the \"Anthology\" collage appears as posters on a shop window as the camera pans quickly across the street. The design also adorned the VHS, laserdisc and DVD releases, again to be properly encountered by laying the cases side-by-side. Upon the release of \"Anthology 3\", HMV stores made available a limited edition cardboard sleeve designed to hold all three CD volumes of which each side of the sleeve make up half of the collage.\n\nAll three albums were made digitally available on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011, alongside a new \"Anthology Highlights\" album which featured a selection of tracks from all three albums and reached number 184 on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s United States Top Current Albums chart.\n\n\nIn October 2000, \"The Beatles Anthology\" book was released, which included interviews with all four band members and others involved, plus rare photos. Many of the interviews quoted are from those featured in the documentary films. The book is designed as a large-format hardback, with imaginative artwork throughout, and several visually impressive and colourful spreads featuring graphics relevant to the proceeding chronology, photographic arrays and a variety of text styles and layouts. The book went straight to the top of the \"New York Times\" bestsellers list. In 2002, the book was released as a large-format paperback.\n\nDuring early 1995 as work on \"The Beatles Anthology\" continued, Yoko Ono and McCartney recorded an avant-garde piece called \"Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue\". Ono provided vocals and McCartney played bass, while Sean Lennon, Linda McCartney, and McCartney's children played various instruments. The piece was broadcast on Japanese public television in memory of the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nThe track \"Carnival of Light\" recorded during the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" sessions was intended to be released on the \"Anthology 2\" album, but was vetoed by George Harrison.\n\nIt was reported that McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked on a new composition called \"All for Love\" in March 1995, intended as a track on \"Anthology 3\", but the effort was abandoned. No version of the song has reached the public.\n\nEach of the three \"Anthology\" albums was accompanied by a promotional CD sampler sent to radio stations shortly before the official release dates. These CDs have since become highly sought collector's items. Even rarer is a vinyl version of the sampler for \"Anthology 2\", which was only sent to college radio stations and featured a different cover (though the contents were the same).\n\nIn October 1996 there was a strictly limited release from EMI, a slip case cover to house all three CD volumes, which have since become extremely rare, fetching high prices among collectors.\n\nThe success of the \"Anthology\" albums was parodied by the release of the Rutles' \"Archaeology\" some months later. Delays in the release of the third volume of the Beatles' series ultimately meant that the Rutles' parody arrived in shops on the same day as its inspiration.\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic parodied \"The Beatles Anthology\" in an \"Al TV\" special. He said he had a copy of a fictional \"Anthology 17\", which he claimed would not be available to the public for a while. He played for the audience a track of Paul McCartney brushing his teeth and Ringo Starr shaving before \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\n\"The Beatles Anthology\" was also parodied on the short-lived \"Dana Carvey Show\", which was being aired on ABC around the same time that \"Anthology\" was being televised on the network.\n"}
{"id": "1032668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1032668", "title": "The California Raisins", "text": "The California Raisins\n\nThe California Raisins were a fictional rhythm and blues animated musical group as well as advertising and merchandising characters composed of anthropomorphized raisins. Lead vocals were sung by musician Buddy Miles. The California Raisins concept experienced high popularity in the mid-to-late 1980s principally through claymation TV commercials and animated specials, winning an Emmy Award and one nomination.\n\nThe concept was originally created for a 1986 Sun-Maid commercial on behalf of the California Raisin Advisory Board when one of the writers, Seth Werner (at the time with the advertising firm Foote, Cone & Belding SF, and now with big) came up with an idea for the new raisin commercial, saying, \"We have tried everything but dancing raisins singing 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'\" (the 1968 song popularized by Marvin Gaye). To their surprise, the commercial became wildly popular, paving the way for several future commercials and opportunities through other media. The commercials were produced by Vinton Studios using their claymation technique, with character designs by Michael Brunsfeld. The following year, the Raisins appeared in the Emmy Award-winning \"A Claymation Christmas Celebration\", singing the Christmas carol \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\".\n\nThe California Raisins released four studio albums on Priority Records between 1987 and 1988, and their signature song, \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\" landed on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. However, the Raisins would continue to make their strongest impression through animated endeavors, and the characters proved popular enough that they were used to endorse Post's Raisin Bran cereal.\n\nOn November 4, 1988, CBS aired a primetime special entitled \"Meet the Raisins!\". The musical mockumentary was again created by Vinton Studios and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. It also provided the band members more personality and individual names: A.C., Beebop (drums), Stretch (bass), and Red (guitar/piano). A Saturday morning cartoon series, \"The California Raisin Show\", debuted the following year but lasted merely 13 episodes. While cel animated by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, it maintained Will Vinton's creative direction. A sequel to the original CBS special aired in 1990 under the title \"The Raisins: Sold Out!: The California Raisins II\". This special saw the Raisins hiring a new manager with the goal of making a comeback.\n\nMany of the items created for the campaign have become part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Merchandise sales included toys and Raisins images on nearly every conceivable medium: lunch boxes, notebooks, clothing, posters, bedsheets, and even a Halloween costume just to name a few. A California Raisins Fan Club began in 1987 which included a Grapevine Gazette Newsletter and various memorabilia. Blackthorne Publishing also released a 6-issue comic book series entitled \"The California Raisins 3-D\" which included 3D glasses; these would later be re-released in the \"Ultimate Collection\" trade paperback.\n\nSeveral California Raisins music albums were also released, featuring classic Motown and rock standards. These albums were included in the Smithsonian collection and were illustrated and art-directed by Helane Freeman, who later became famous for her work on \"Hannah Montana\" and \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", among other Disney programs.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable piece of California Raisins merchandise, however, came in the form of small, non-poseable California Raisins figures. The Hardee's restaurant chain offered these as part of a promotion for their Cinnamon 'N' Raisin biscuits. Different collections were produced in 1987, 1988, 1991, and finally in 2001 (the latter adding Carls Jr. due to their late '90s acquisition of Hardee's) for their new stylization. This latest incarnation can still be seen on the California Raisin Marketing Board website.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Capcom produced a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled \"\", in which the player controlled a California Raisin through five side-scrolling levels battling various evil fruit and vegetable characters that have stolen the Raisins' music. The game was completed and several video game critics reviewed it, but it was never released on the open market.\n\nAlthough popular with the public, the California Raisin campaign eventually failed because its production cost the raisin growers almost twice their earnings. CALRAB, the organization who made the campaign, was also closed on July 31, 1994 due to disagreements with raisin producers over the fairness of required payments to the organization.\n\nOn March 28, 1997 \"Entertainment Weekly\" published \"The 50 Best Commercials of All Time\" as its cover story. The article ranked The California Raisins' premiere advertisement, \"Lunchbox,\" at #15 with comments by ad agency executive Claude Jacques and described the Raisins as \"The coolest wrinkled musicians this side of the Stones.\"\n\nThe vast amount of California Raisins merchandise has made for a substantial collectors' market. It even led to an unauthorized collectibles guide published in 1998, cataloging the many items based on the clay characters.\n\nIn 2002, the Food Network program \"Unwrapped\" featured a segment on The California Raisins featuring interviews with Will Vinton, David Altschul, and Mark Gustafson of Vinton Studios. Concept illustrations of the Raisins were also featured as interviewees discussed the characters' creation.\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"'Tis the Fifteenth Season\", The California Raisins were spoofed as \"The California Prunes\", on a special entitled \"Christmas with the California Prunes\". Lisa dismisses it as \"offensive to both Christians \"and\" prunes.\"\n\nAn article published by AnimateClay.com in the late 2000s details the whereabouts of the original claymation sculptures used by Vinton Studios. The figures were kept in a box for several years and headed for the trash before being obtained by Webster Colcord, a former employee of Vinton. Several photos were taken providing a close look at the Raisins' internal armatures and detailing their extremely poor condition, including the absence of the A.C. puppet's head.\n\nAs of the 2010s, packages of Sun-Maid Natural California Raisins still modestly feature an updated California Raisin character. This figure is also included on CalRaisins.org.\n\nIn 2010, claymation versions of the California Raisins were featured in the special Christmas episode of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", '\"A Very Sunny Christmas.\"\n\nIn 2014, the California Raisins made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial \"The '80s Called\".\n\nIn 2017, an episode of \"The Simpsons\" called \"The Cad and the Hat\" included a couch gag segment featuring the California Raisins being killed by Homer.\n\nIn 2018, an episode of \"The Americans\" called \"Rififi\" feature a cereal box featuring the California Raisins on the back.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that a live-action/CGI reboot of the California Raisins would be produced, with president of The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation, Rusty Citron, as one of the people behind the project.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7216989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7216989", "title": "The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy", "text": "The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy\n\nThe Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy (also known as Billy & Mandy) is an American animated television series created by Maxwell Atoms for Cartoon Network, and is the 14th of the network's Cartoon Cartoons (albeit on when it was part of \"Grim & Evil\", due to the \"Cartoon Cartoons\" brand being temporarily discontinued earlier in June 2003; the show itself is considered by some to still be a \"Cartoon Cartoon\" show regardless). It follows two children named Billy—a slow-witted happy-go-lucky boy—and Mandy—his dark and cynical best friend—who, after winning a limbo game to save Billy's pet hamster, gain the mighty Grim Reaper as their best friend in eternal servitude and slavery.\n\n\"Billy & Mandy\" began as a series of segments on \"Grim & Evil\", from which it was spun-off, along with \"Evil Con Carne\", on August 24, 2001. The show ran as a separate series from June 13, 2003 to November 9, 2007, but a telefilm, titled \"\", aired on October 12, 2008, officially bringing the series to a close. In addition to the episodes, three movies, two special episodes, and nineteen shorts were made, with 3 award wins for the series as a whole. \"Billy & Mandy\" has also been made into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise. Reruns can currently be seen on Boomerang.\n\nThe series is centered around the exploits of Billy (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz), a completely idiotic and happy-go-lucky boy; Mandy (Grey DeLisle), a cynical and merciless girl, and Grim (Greg Eagles), the Grim Reaper who is often tormented by the duo. After cheating at a limbo match against Grim (in retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he is enslaved in a permanently unwanted friendship with the children. Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a love-hate relationship with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude.\n\nBilly and Mandy use Grim's supernatural abilities and powers to venture into supernatural locations or environments, such as the Underworld, or the Netherworld, inhabited by an assortment of grotesque monstrous beasts. The pair also use Grim's enormously strong supernatural abilities or ties with a number of beastly characters to achieve goals or desires for themselves, often with twisted results. Famed fictional monsters including Dracula, the Wolfman, and the bogeyman are also comically depicted in the series.\n\nSupporting characters include Irwin (Vanessa Marshall), a nerdy awkward boy who has a crush on Mandy; Harold (Richard Steven Horvitz), Billy's father who is even dumber than his son; Gladys (Jennifer Hale), Billy's loving yet mentally unstable mother; Mindy (Rachael MacFarlane), the snobby, stuck-up, and spoiled queen bee of Billy and Mandy's school; Sperg (Greg Eagles), the local bully who has a sensitive side; Fred Fredburger (C.H. Greenblatt), a simple-minded, irritating underworld creature who loves frozen yogurt and nachos; Dracula (Phil LaMarr), a selfish elderly vampire who's revealed to be Irwin's paternal grandfather in the final season of the show.\n\nThe show lacks continuity for the most part, as many episodes end with characters killed, exiled, or stuck in a situation. Characters sometimes display an awareness of some events from previous episodes, but there are no clear character arcs or coherent plot lines tying the show together.\n\nThe series had its genesis in 1995, when Maxwell Atoms, while he was a junior at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, made a two-minute short film for his thesis project. Titled \"Billy and Mandy in: The Trepanation of the Skull and You\", it centers around Billy and Mandy (prototype versions) discussing trepanning with each other. In the end, Mandy drills Billy's head, causing him to pass out after too much blood loss even though he says he feels great. The short had never been shown publicly until April 30, 2016, during the first annual TromAnimation Film Festival. After the screening, Atoms uploaded the film, albeit in a deteriorating state after years of storage, on his YouTube channel.\n\nThe show's existence is the result of a viewer poll event by way of telephone and the Internet called \"Cartoon Network's Big Pick\" which was held from June 16 to August 25, 2000. The three final choices were \"Grim and Evil\" (later splitting into two separate series: \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\" and \"Evil Con Carne\"), \"Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?\" and \"Longhair and Doubledome\". Out of the three, \"Grim and Evil\" attained the most votes with 57%; \"Robot Jones\" came in second place at 23% while \"Longhair and Doubledome\" received 20% of the vote.\n\nOriginally part of \"Grim & Evil\", \"Billy & Mandy\" served as the main show. In each episode, an \"Evil Con Carne\" short was put between two \"Grim\" shorts. On occasion, it was the other way around, with two \"Evil\" shorts and one \"Grim\" short. The series premiered on August 24, 2001, during the \"Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Big Pick Weekend\".\n\nOn June 13, 2003, the network separated the two segments and gave each their own full-length program. The short-lived \"Evil Con Carne\" show was cancelled once the already-produced season had aired. Some characters from \"Evil Con Carne\" occasionally appeared on \"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\". General Skarr become an official character on the show in the episode \"Skarred for Life\", where he becomes Billy's new next-door neighbor, and in \"Company Halt\", the ninth episode of the final season which functions as the true series finale for \"Evil Con Carne\", Ghastly, Hector, Boskov, and Stomach restart their evil organization and convince Skarr to join them, but their plans are ultimately foiled by Billy and Mandy, and Skarr goes back to living his life as a normal person.\n\n\"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\" received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network's top rated and most popular series. Common Sense Media gave the show a 3/5 star rating and stated that it has \"goofy punchlines and obscure cultural references\", and recommends the viewer age be at least 8 years old. The series has won one Annie Award, two Emmy Awards and including those three wins, has been nominated a total of nine times for various awards. New episodes were broadcast on Cartoon Network Fridays at 7:30pm to over 1 million viewers an episode.\n\nThree TV movies were made for the series. The first one was called \"Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure\" and was released on DVD in April, 2007. Common Sense Media gave the movie 2/5 stars and is meant for kids over the age of 8 calling it \"undeniably gross and just as undeniably funny\". DVDverdict.com gave the movie a good review as well.\n\nA second movie, \"Wrath of the Spider Queen\", was also released in 2007. It was based on a spider queen from Grim's distant past, who tries to take revenge on him because she was meant to be the reaper. Meanwhile, keeping up with the spider theme, Billy learns to love his spider son Jeff.\n\nOn October 12, 2008, a third and final spin-off movie, titled \"Underfist: Halloween Bash\", premiered. The movie's primary focus is on Irwin, Jeff the Spider, Hoss Delgado, General Skarr, and Fred Fredburger accidentally coming together to defeat an invasion of chocolate bar monsters, led by an evil marshmallow bunny, on Halloween night.\n\nThe score composers for the series are Gregory Hinde, Drew Neumann and Guy Moon. In addition, two songs were made for the show by Aurelio Voltaire, the episode \"Little Rock of Horrors\", which parodies the musical \"Little Shop of Horrors\", features a song titled \"BRAINS!\" and, in \"Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure\", the song \"Land of the Dead\" is played in the opening credits. Both songs are a part of the album \"Spooky Songs For Creepy Kids\". The season two episode \"Battle of the Bands\" also featured the song \"Darkness\" by metal band SPF 1000. There was also an instance at the end of the Christmas special entitled \"Billy & Mandy Save Christmas\", where the end credits music is the song \"Round and Round\" by heavy metal band Ratt.\n\nA video game inspired by the series was developed by Midway Games, and released on October 2, 2006. It is a 3D fighting game. The video game received fair to good reviews: GameSpot gave it a 6.6/10 by Greg Mueller, he goes on to say that while it is fun for the \"first few hours\" and has \"Fast-paced gameplay\" the game action \"gets old quickly\" and has a very short story mode. IGN gave the game a good score of 7.2/10 highlighting its presentation and appeal. Metacritic gave the game a rating of 61/100 based on 10 critic reviews.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "104952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=104952", "title": "Tragicomedy", "text": "Tragicomedy\n\nTragicomedy is a literary genre that blends aspects of both tragic and comic forms. Most often seen in dramatic literature, the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.\n\nThere is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the classical age. It appears that the Greek philosopher Aristotle had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in \"Poetics\", he discusses tragedy with a dual ending. In this respect, a number of Greek and Roman plays, for instance \"Alcestis\", may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot. The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright Plautus, who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play \"Amphitryon\". The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a \"tragicomoedia\":\n\nPlautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on Renaissance aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory. For \"rule mongers\" (the term is Giordano Bruno's), \"mixed\" works such as those mentioned above, more recent \"romances\" such as \"Orlando Furioso\", and even \"The Odyssey\" were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes. Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (\"tragedia de lieto fin\") was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays. Even more important was Giovanni Battista Guarini. Guarini's \"Il Pastor Fido\", published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day. Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting. All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.\n\nIn England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different. In the sixteenth century, \"tragicomedy\" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions. These were the features Philip Sidney deplored in his complaint against the \"mungrell Tragy-comedie\" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: \"The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.\" Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: Shakespeare's last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.\n\nBy the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. John Fletcher's \"The Faithful Shepherdess\", an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608. In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: \"A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie.\" Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death. But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.\n\nSome of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably Philip Massinger and James Shirley, wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. Richard Brome also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from John Ford to Lodowick Carlell to Sir Aston Cockayne, made attempts in the genre.\n\nTragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well. The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the \"tragedy with a happy ending\" eventually developed into melodrama, in which form it still flourishes.\n\nThe more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing defined it as a mixture of emotions in which \"seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure.\" Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and \"dark\" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett. Also it can be seen in absurdist drama. Friedrich Dürrenmatt, the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play \"The Visit\" (1956) as a tragicomedy. Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-World War II British theatre, with authors as varied as Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard, John Arden, Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter writing in this genre. Many writers of the metamodernist and postmodernist movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or gallows humor. A notable example of a metamodernist tragicomedy is David Foster Wallace's 1996 magnum opus, \"Infinite Jest\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21000608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21000608", "title": "Turkey bowling", "text": "Turkey bowling\n\nTurkey bowling is a sport which is based on ordinary bowling: a frozen turkey serves as a bowling ball and 10 plastic bottles of soft drinks or water are the bowling pins. The turkey is bowled down a smooth surface, for example, ice or a soap covered sheet of painters plastic (using a bar of soap). It is commonly associated with Thanksgiving.\nTurkey bowling is popular in minor league ice hockey in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe original variant involves turkey bowling in an aisle of a grocery store. A Derrick Johnson claims to have invented turkey bowling in 1988 when he worked as a grocery clerk at a Newport Beach Lucky's branch, while observing a manager slide a frozen turkey across the floor and accidentally topple a soda bottle.\n\nDerrick became a self-appointed commissioner of the \"Poultry Bowlers Association\" and codified the rules and terminology, such as \"the fowl line\" (cf. \"foul line\"), \"the gobbler\" (three strikes in a row; cf. turkey (bowling)), \"the Butterball\" (a gutterball) and \"the wishbone\" (a 7-10 split).\n\nTurkey bowling was featured in the 1995 novel \"Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story\" by Christopher Moore, where it was the favorite sport of \"The Animals\", a wild group of night grocery stockers (continued in the sequels \"You Suck: A Love Story\" and \"\").\n\nEpisode 14 of \"10 Items or Less\" TV series was \"Turkey Bowling\".\n\nThe \"Guy's Grocery Games\" episode \"Frozen Food Fight\" featured a round where two contestants bowled a frozen turkey at nine soda bottles; the combined number knocked down was the number of non-frozen items each was allowed to use in their next dish.\n\nEvery Thanksgiving morning, Cleveland's Fox affiliate WJW-TV does its annual Turkey Bowl from a Giant Eagle store in the Greater Cleveland, Ohio area. The WJW version of turkey bowling uses 15 cans of canned cranberry sauce, stacked in a pyramid shape, and uses a one-bowl-per-round knockout tournament format. In the 2010 edition it was hosted by morning features and man about town reporter Kenny Crumpton and morning meteorologist Angelica Campos. In WJW-TV's version people win prizes anything ranging from Giant Eagle Gift Cards to monetary prizes. The contest is broadcast on WJW live and streamed around the world on WJW's Web site, with the contests taking up the full closing segment (around 7 minutes) of each half-hour of WJW's morning newscast. The broadcast began in 1999.\n\nAnimal rights proponents, who oppose the use of animals in sports, claim that turkey bowling is disrespectful to animals and sends mixed messages which may encourage violence to animals or people. Another objection is perceived disrespect to the central attribute of Thanksgiving. In 2003, an upcoming event for the title of UK Great Turkey Bowling Champion at Manchester Evening News Arena was protested against by animal rights campaigners; as a result, plastic turkeys were used instead of real frozen turkeys. In 2007 an animal sanctuary rescued a live turkey, which was in a cage, from a turkey bowling event in New York State.\n"}
{"id": "380286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380286", "title": "Wit", "text": "Wit\n\nWit is a form of intelligent humour, the ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny. A wit is a person skilled at making clever and funny remarks. Forms of wit include the quip, repartee, and wisecrack.\n\nAs in the wit of Dorothy Parker's set, the Algonquin Round Table, witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as in many epigrams), and perhaps more ingenious than funny.\n\nA quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of a point, and a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort. (Wilde: \"I wish I'd said that.\" Whistler: \"You will, Oscar, you will\".)\n\nWit in poetry is characteristic of metaphysical poetry as a style, and was prevalent in the time of English playwright Shakespeare, who admonished pretension with the phrase \"Better a witty fool than a foolish wit\". It may combine word play with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-aloud funny; in fact wit can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings that are being versified. English poet John Donne is the representative of this style of poetry.\n\nMore generally, one's wits are one's intellectual powers of all types. Native wit — meaning the wits with which one is born — is closely synonymous with common sense. To live by one's wits is to be an opportunist, but not always of the scrupulous kind. To have one's wits about one is to be alert and capable of quick reasoning. To be at the end of one's wits (\"I'm at my wits' end\") is to be immensely frustrated.\n\n\n"}
