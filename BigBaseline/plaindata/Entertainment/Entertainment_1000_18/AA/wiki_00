The term \"2.5D musical\" was coined to describe stories presented in two-dimensional medium being brought to real life.\n\nApproximately 70 2.5D musicals were produced in 2013 and attracted at least 1.6 million people, most of them young women in their teens and 20s. 2.5D musicals are often seen as the starting point of many young actors in Japan.\n\n2.5D musicals are defined through make-up and costuming that accurately depicts the actor as the original character, along with exaggerated acting that mimics the original expressions in the original work. It also include special effects and stunts that reenact the setting and tone of the original work. Directors of the musicals are usually the ones who write the lyrics to the songs. With the evolution of technology, some of the modern 2.5D musicals uses projection mapping, in which backgrounds and special effects are projected onto the stage and screens. According to the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, the term not only applies to musicals, but also plays, comedies, and dramas.\n\nThe first successful manga-based musical production was \"The Rose of Versailles\" in 1974 by the Takarazuka Revue. At the time, these plays were simply known as \"musicals\" or \"anime musicals.\" Around the 1990s, a number of musicals and small stage skits produced were based on anime and manga series aimed at elementary school girls, such as \"Sailor Moon\", \"Akazukin Chacha\", and \"Hime-chan's Ribbon\", which performed moderately well, but were not popular and were known as . However, in 2000, \"Hunter x Hunter\" became revolutionary at the time because the voice cast for the original anime series had also played the characters on stage.\n\nJapanese media-based musicals rose to popularity in 2003 with \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\" through word-of-mouth and social media, which soon became a starting point for many up-and-coming actors. The shows attracted more than 2 million people during its run and was notable for using stage effects to simulate a tennis match, and it was popular enough to include its first overseas shows in South Korea and Taiwan in 2008. After its success, many productions based on anime, manga, and video games soon followed, some of the well-documented ones including \"Naruto\", \"Yowamushi Pedal\", \"Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!\" among others. Unlike productions featuring the Takarazuka Revue, which are supported by fans of the troupe, these musicals mainly draw anime and manga fans and other audiences that usually do not see plays on a regular basis.\n\nThe term \"2.5D musicals\" was codified in 2014 when the initial director of \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\", Makoto Matsuda, first established the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association. At first, despite the success of \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\", he did not consider it a formal stage production on par with most modern theater performances imported from Western works such as Broadway productions. However, after a group of South Korean musical professionals had acknowledged \"Black Butler\"'s production value and standards in performing arts, Matsuda decided to bring the genre worldwide. Plays certified by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association offer theater glasses that contain subtitles in Chinese and English for people who do not speak Japanese. Starting in 2014, many 2.5D musicals have also been performed abroad in places like China, Taiwan, the United States, and parts of Europe.\n\nIn 2018, \"2.5D Musical Studies\" was added as a program at the Tokyo School of Anime. In April 2018, actor Kenta Suga, who has starred as Gaara in \"Naruto\" and Hinata in \"Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!\" became appointed as the overseas ambassador by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, succeeding Ryo Kato.\n\n"}

A barker would often conduct a brief free show, introducing performers and describing acts to be given at the feature performance. Professional barkers strongly disliked the term and instead referred to themselves as \"talkers\". \n\nPerhaps the most famous fictional barkers are Billy Bigelow, the protagonist of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic stage musical \"Carousel\", and Tin Man, a supporting protagonist from the 1978 musical film \"The Wiz\" portrayed by Nipsey Russell. Bigelow, in turn was an Americanized version of Liliom, the protagonist of Hungarian author Ferenc Molnár's non-musical play \"Liliom\", on which \"Carousel\" is based.\n\nAlso the film \"The Barker\" from 1928 stands for this profession.\n\n"}

It is located in Voroshylovskyi Raion, in the west it matches with stadium Shakhtar, and in the north there is the Second city pond.\n\nPark was open in 1932. There are rides, playgrounds, alleys for hiking and other recreational facilities available for visitors.\nThe park is named after Alexander Sergeevich Shcherbakov, who was the Secretary of the Donetsk Oblast Party Committee in 1938. However, the original name was different – at first the park was named after Pavel Petrovich Postyshev, but the park was renamed after the last had been arrested.\n\nThe park is located in Skoromoshnaya gully, which was the meeting place for workers of Yuzovsky metallurgical plant and the nearby coal mines in the 19th century. A travelling circus stayed here and mass celebrations were held. In 1891 the river was blocked by a dam, resulting in a first city pond that provided the steel works with water. In 1931 they decided to create a park, and in September 1932 10 000 Komsomol members and the city pioneers started work on park creation. 120 hectares of the open steppe land area near river Bakhmutka (First city pond) in the Skomoroshnaya gully was allocated for the park.\nIn 1933 the alleys were established lined with chestnut trees, lime trees and poplars. On opening day about sixty thousand people visited the park. Amusement rides started functioning in 1934. Later, the area of the park was increased to 200 hectares, yet reduced to 96 hectares by 2000. At the initial planning except the Central Park there were separate functional zones: a Central Beach park, Amusement park, Regional Park \"Medium Ponds\", landscape park \"Urban forest\" and the \"Upper\" landscape park. The park is located along the coastline of connected ponds, and landscape compositions, most open to the water area direction. In the center the terraces are situated, the lowest of which is the parterre, which is the basis of the composition. The stadium Shakhtar is built on the upper terrace in 1936 (designed by architects Georgy Nawrocki and S. Severin). In 1932 the park held an agricultural exhibition, for which pavilions were built. Before 2008 entrance to the park from Stadionnaya street looked like a group of columns with cornices; in 2008 it was decorated with ornate metal gates and became a major entrance. In the postwar period in the park there were about a hundred names of tree and shrub species, and the 1955 edition \"Donbass Parks\" referred to Shcherbakov park as to one of the best parks in Donbas. On November 15, 2008 Donetsk journalists established \"Alley of Journalists\". In 2006 reconstruction of the large park started, \"Donetskproekt\" fulfilled the pre-design for improvement of the waterfront in the park. During the reconstruction the pond embankment was reinforced and purged. In 2008 forged pavilion was established in the park and rosary with variety of roses was made.\n\nThe sculptural decoration of the park of the Soviet times was ideology-determined. White statue of Joseph Stalin was established in front of the bridge framed in acacia and dominated over the whole complex of the central park. Behind the back of Stalin statue there was a sculpture of athlete jumping into the water and the fountain with athletes' sculptures who were holding a vase in outstretched hands. In the fountain bowl there was a sculpture of a Sportswoman with ball. Stadium \"Shakhtar\" was decorated with monumental sculptures on the second floor. The sculptures of the postwar period were dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park. During the renovation of the park in 2006-2008, a statue of the ancient girl with a jar was placed on the banking of the \"First\" pond. Also in 2008, in order to commemorate the City and the Miner's Day the \"Good Angel of Peace\" was established in the Park as international symbol of patronage. On the statue basis the names of famous Ukrainian patrons are carved: Nickolay Tereshchenko, Bogdan Khanenko, Vasiliy Tarnovskiy, Rinat Akhmetov and others. In 2008, 46 wooden sculptures depicting fantasy characters were established in the Park.\n\nThe fountain with athletes sculptures was dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park, and replaced by a fountain, surrounded by a parapet. A cascade of fountains was organized from the central area to the bridge. Fountains of the 1970s were dismantled in the 2000s (decade). In 2007 a new fountain, consisting of 6 cups, lined with marble was open in the park. 200 lights are used in the fountain construction. During the renovation of the Park in 2006 - 2008 at the entrance from Stadionnaya street a new fountain was installed.\n\nChildren's Railway named after Kirov was launched on November 24, 1936. The train consisted of two coupled together trams and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the World War II outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt. The park also previously had a musical shell, a summer theater for 1000 spectators, \"Green\" summer cinema for 2,200 seats, a dance floor, a restaurant, parachute tower (existed until 1970), reading, chess and checkers pavilions. Currently 23 kinds of amusement rides are working in the park, the boat station offers boats and catamarans to hire. In 2009 Dolphinarium \"Nemo\" was open as a part of the national complex of cultural and recreational centres «Nemo». The (at the time abandoned) dolphinarium was destroyed in a fire in November 2016.\n\n\n"}

It includes two books, two live-action theatrical films, two video games, and a ride.\n\n\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is a 1964 children's book by British author Roald Dahl. The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was first published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1964 and in the United Kingdom by George Allen & Unwin in 1967.\n\n\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\" is the sequel to \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", continuing the story of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka as they travel in the Great Glass Elevator. \"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\" was first published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in 1972, and in the United Kingdom by George Allen & Unwin in 1973.\n\n\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" is a 1971 musical film adaptation of the 1964 novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" by Roald Dahl. It was directed by Mel Stuart, and starred Gene Wilder as Wonka. The film tells the story of Charlie Bucket as he receives a golden ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in Munich in 1970, and the film was released on June 30, 1971. It received positive reviews, but it was a box office disappointment despite the fact that it recouped its budget. However, it developed into a cult film due to its repeated television airings and home video sales. In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is a 2005 film adaptation of the 1964 book of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film was directed by Tim Burton. The film stars Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. The storyline concerns Charlie, who takes a tour he has won, led by Wonka, through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world. Development for another adaptation of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", filmed previously as \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", began in 1991, 20 years after the first film version, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while Warner Bros. either considered or discussed the role of Willy Wonka with Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith and Adam Sandler. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" represents the first time since \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" that Elfman contributed to the film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, where Burton avoided using digital effects as much as possible. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was released to critical praise and was a box office success, grossing approximately $475 million worldwide, but received mixed to negative reviews when compared with the original 1971 film.\n\nA direct-to-video animated crossover film adaptation starring Tom and Jerry, entitled \"Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\", was released in 2017. It stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to Gene Wilder, who died less than a year before the release.\n\nIn October 2016 it was confirmed that Warner Bros are planning a prequel film depicting Willy Wonka's \"early adventures\" prior to the events depicted in the books and films. However, Warner Bros claims that this movie will not be an origin story. In February 2018, Paul King entered final negotiations to direct the film. In November 2018, the producer confirmed it would be a prequel film, which would explore the adventures of Wonka before he opened the chocolate factory.\n\n\"Roald Dahl's Willy Wonka\" is a musical that combines elements of both Roald Dahl's book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and of the 1971 movie \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" with newly created material. The musical has several versions: the original version which premiered in 2004, the Junior version, the Kids version, and the Theatre for Young Audience version. All are owned by Music Theatre International, the company that owns the Willy Wonka license.\n\nThe Estate of Roald Dahl sanctioned an operatic adaptation called \"The Golden Ticket\". It was written by composer Peter Ash and British librettist Donald Sturrock. \"The Golden Ticket\" has completely original music and was commissioned by the American Lyric Theater, Lawrence Edelson (producing artistic director), and Felicity Dahl. The opera received its world premiere at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis on 13 June 2010, in a co-production with American Lyric Theater and Wexford Festival Opera.\n\nA musical based on the novel, titled \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" premiered at the West End's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in May 2013 and officially opened on 25 June. The show is directed by Sam Mendes, with new songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, and stars Douglas Hodge as Willy Wonka. The production broke records for weekly ticket sales. Coincidentally, Hodge was also the voice of a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory audiobook, as part of a package of Roald Dahl CDs read by celebrities.\n\nThere are two \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" video games, one made in 1985 and another in 2005. The games are based on the book of the same name.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride is a dark ride located in the Cloud Cuckoo Land area of Alton Towers theme park, Staffordshire, England. It is based upon the famous Roald Dahl book of the same name, and takes its thematic inspiration from the illustrations of Quentin Blake. The ride is split into two segments, the first being a boat ride along the chocolate river inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Passengers encounter all the characters from the book (going from Augustus Gloop to Veruca Salt) either as simple animatronics or CGI projections. After disembarking the boats the second segment begins with a short pre-show video (involving Mike Teevee). The video is presented as if the viewers are actually trapped within the TV set. The ride continues inside one of two 'Great Glass Elevators' which simulate passengers taking an airborne trip through the rest of the factory. Each elevator is a static room with semi-translucent walls and ceiling on which CGI animations are projected from the outside, and only the floor trembles slightly to give the impression of movement.\n\nList indicator(s)\n\n"}
{"id": "5928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5928", "title": "Clown", "text": "Clown\n\nA clown is a comic performer who employs slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.\n\nClowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. \n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the circus clown, which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or \"Varieté\" shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by Joseph Grimaldi (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe comedy that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. \n\nThe \"fear of clowns,\" circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term coulrophobia.\n\nThe \"\"clown\" character developed out of the zanni \"rustic fool\" characters of the early modern commedia dell'arte, which were themselves directly based on the \"rustic fool\"\" characters of ancient Greek and Roman theatre.\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as \" sklêro-paiktês\" (from \"paizein\" \"to play (like a child)\") or \"deikeliktas\", besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was \"fossor\", literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was first recorded c. 1560 (as \"clowne, cloyne\") in the generic meaning \"rustic, boor, peasant\". \nThe origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with \"clumsy\".\nIt is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of fool characters in Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and \"The Winter's Tale\".\nThe sense of \"clown\" as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on Elizabethan \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe harlequinade developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for Harlequin's slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by Joseph Grimaldi, who played Clown in Charles Dibdin's 1800 pantomime \"Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World\" at Sadler's Wells Theatre, where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.\n\nThe circus clown developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from Philip Astley's London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian George L. Fox became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\nTom Belling senior (1843–1900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (\"Dummer August\") character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for Circus Renz in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera \"Pagliacci\" (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's \"Auguste\" character was further popularized by Nicolai Poliakoff's \"Coco\" in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French \"clown\", Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian \"klovn\", Romanian \"clovn\" etc.\n\nItalian retains \"Pagliaccio\", a Commedia dell'arte zanni character, and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French \"Paillasse\", Spanish \"payaso\", Catalan/Galician \"pallasso\", Portuguese \"palhaço\", Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish \"palyaço\", German \"Pajass\" (via French), Yiddish פּאַיאַץ (\"payats\"), Russian пая́ц.\n\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the tramp or hobo. Examples include Marceline Orbes, who performed at the Hippodrome Theater(1905), Charlie Chaplin's \"The Tramp\" (1914), and Emmett Kelly's \"Weary Willie\" based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by Otto Griebling during the 1930s to 1950s. Red Skelton's Dodo the Clown in \"The Clown\" (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".\n\nIn the United States, Bozo the Clown was an influential \"Auguste\" character since the late 1950s. \"The Bozo Show\" premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. McDonald's derived its mascot clown, Ronald McDonald, from the \"Bozo\" character in the 1960s. Willard Scott, who had played \"Bozo\" during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the \"Bozo\" template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (\"Bozo\"-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"Clown Care\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. Clowns of America International (established 1984) and World Clown Association (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a \"Bozo\"-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the evil clown character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.\n\nThere are different types of clowns portrayed around the world. They include\n\nThe classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition\nhas a precedent in the pairing of Pierrot and Harlequin in the Commedia dell'arte.\nOriginally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.\n\nIn the 18th-century English Harlequinade, Harlequin was now paired with Clown.\nAs developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nThe \"white clown\", or \"clown blanc\" from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste. They are also distinguished as the \"sad clown\" (blanc) and \"happy clown\" (auguste).\n\nThe Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe \"contra-auguste\" plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the Pierrot character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque \"Auguste\" types. Francesco Caroli and Glenn \"Frosty\" Little are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the \"Bozo\" type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of Abbott and Costello, Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible. In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by Joseph Grimaldi in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star George \"G.L.\" Fox. Following English Joseph Grimaldi, Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.\n\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or hobo. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps Otto Griebling and Emmett Kelly. Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Sacha Baron Cohen would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the \"hobo\", \"tramp\" or \"bum\" clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is attitude. According to American circus expert Hovey Burgess, they are :\n\nClowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.\n\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as tightrope, juggling, unicycling, Master of Ceremonies, or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the orchestra. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\nFrameworks are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act. Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\nShows are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n\n\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few \"gags\" or several \"bits\". Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the \"artiste\" by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car\" stunt; doing just about anything with a rubber chicken, tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"clown bikes\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such \"clowns\" have an important position are termed \"clown societies\", and a \"clown\" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a \"ritual clown\".\n\nThe most ancient \"clowns\" have been found in the Fifth dynasty of Egypt, around 2400 BC. Unlike court jesters, clowns have traditionally served a socio-religious and psychological role, and traditionally the roles of priest and clown have been held by the same persons.\nPeter Berger writes that \"It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society\". For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a physical performance discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.\n\nIn Native American mythology, the Trickster channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character. A Heyoka is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles. The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse. The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a Winkte.\n\nMany native tribes have a history of clowning.\nThe Canadian Clowning method developed by Richard Pochinko and furthered by his former apprentice, Sue Morrison, combines European and Native American clowning techniques.\n\nIn this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the medicine wheel. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Sometimes also referred to as sight reading, it is a technique used by actors and other performers in theatre, television, and film performance fields. \n\nCold readings are common in performance classes, and furthermore are employed frequently in actor auditions to allow the producer or playwright to get a general idea of the actors' performing capabilities. They are also employed by playwrights who need to hear their play read aloud for the first time by actors, and as such they form an initial integral component of the collaborative creative theatrical process, which may or may not include the eventual production of the play itself. (Public performances of cold readings also serve as entertainment in their own right, particularly in the context of community theater, and less public readings can serve as creative incubators for more established playwright and theatrical talent during the course of play development.) Many actors and other performers and public speakers take classes and practice at length to improve the quality of their cold readings.\n\nCold reading can also be used in conjunction with improvisations to gauge a performer's ability to perform new works. A good dramatic cold reader is able to communicate with fluency and clarity and to project speech rhythms and rhymes well. The reader should also be able to bring out the intent, mood and characterization of a piece through appropriate articulation and body language.\n"}
{"id": "179375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179375", "title": "Comedian", "text": "Comedian\n\nA comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh. This might take many forms including jokes, satirical observations, amusing situations, acting foolish (as in slapstick) or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian. Other practises include the sitcom, sketch comedy and improv.\n\nA popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn, is, \"A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny\", which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.\n\nA lot of creative and original comedy is based on surrealism and absurdity. Early pioneers in these comedic forms include Spike Milligan and Monty Python. Current examples include Vic and Bob, Noel Fielding and Sam Simmons. Elements of surreal and absurd comedy include the non-sequitur (where language or events do not follow a logical process/sequence), irony (where a message is conveyed in a way contrary to its content) and deadpan performance (in the face of surreal and absurd situations, furthering the absurdity).\n\nSince the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called alternative comedy, has grown in popularity with more offbeat and experimental style. Alternative comedy was initially inspired by punk culture and rejected old comedy forms, the establishment and bigoted humour. Ben Elton, Rik Mayall, Malcolm Hardee and Alexi Sayle were among the most well-known 1980's alternative comedians. Alternative comedy experienced a revival since around 2010, with Stewart Lee promoting the liberal, progressive values of the movement and many younger comedians in the UK banding together in groups dedicated to alternative comedy including The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society and the Weirdos Collective.\n\nMany comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, the Edinburgh Fringe, and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais. However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.\n\nComedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when Aristophanes, a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of satyr plays.\n\nThe English poet and playwright William Shakespeare wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and Stan Laurel were protégés of Fred Karno, the English theatre impresario of British music hall, and in his biography Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\". Chaplin wrote comedic silent films such as \"Modern Times\" and \"The Kid\". His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.\n\nOne of the most popular forms of modern-day comedy is stand-up comedy. Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed by one or more people standing on a stage. Bob Hope was the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, and also starred in numerous comedy films over a five-decade span. Other noted stand-up comedians include Billy Connolly, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Jerry Seinfeld, Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, Louis CK and Chris Rock.\n\nRadio has been a proving-ground for many comedians. Ricky Gervais career began at a London radio station called XFM and Chris Morris (satirist) began his career at Radio Cambridgeshire. The League of Gentlemen, Mitchell and Webb and The Mighty Boosh all transferred to television after broadcasting on BBC Radio 4. Between 2002 and 2011 BBC Radio 6 Music used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including Phil Jupitus, Stephen Merchant and Adam & Joe. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 4 Extra. Before television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy, The Goon Show and Hancock's Half Hour being among the most popular early shows.\n\nOn television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, Graham Norton, Daniel Tosh, Chris Hardwick, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and Chelsea Handler. There are sketch comedies, such as [[Kids In The Hall and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show \"[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]\" (a [[BBC]] show that influenced \"[[Saturday Night Live]]\"), then there are sitcoms, for example [[Friends]], [[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]] and [[Father Ted]], as well as popular panel shows like [[QI]], [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] and [[8 out of 10 Cats]].\n\nComedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. Comedians streaming video of their standup include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicise their work and build an audience through social media, especially [[Twitter]].\n\nThere are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. [[The Two Ronnies]] often used puns and double-entendre. [[Bec Hill]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US). [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique. Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation (eg. [[Peter Kay]]), whimsy (eg. [[Bill Bailey]]), self-deprecation (eg. [[Daniel Kitson]]) and parody (eg. [[Jennifer Saunders]]).\n\nIn a January 2014 study, conducted in the \"[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]\", scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored \"significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs.\" Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, \"the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\" However, labeling comedians' personality traits as \"psychotic\" does not mean that individual is a psychopath, since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.\n\n[[File:Kevin_Hart_2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Hart]]]]\n[[File:Jerry Seinfeld knocks on the Oval Office window.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerry Seinfeld]] (left)]]\n\"[[Forbes]]\" publishes an annual list of the most financially successful comedians in the world, similarly to their [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100 list]]. Their data sources include [[Nielsen Media Research]], [[Pollstar]], [[Box Office Mojo]] and [[IMDb]]. The list was topped by [[Jerry Seinfeld]] from 2006 until 2015, who lost the title to [[Kevin Hart]] in 2016. In that year, the eight highest paid comedians were from the United States, including [[Amy Schumer]], who became the first woman to be listed in the top ten.

{"id": "16663203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16663203", "title": "Comedy (drama)", "text": "Comedy (drama)\n\nA comedy is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh. For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the Middle Ages, the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense Dante used the term in the title of his poem, the \"Divine Comedy\" (Italian: \"Divina Commedia\").\n\nThe phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and agreed upon the predominating characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus Thomas Hobbes speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory.\" Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\nMuch comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of opposite expectations, but there are many recognized genres of comedy. Satire and political satire use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.\n\nParody borrows the form of some popular genre, artwork, or text but uses certain ironic changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). Screwball comedy derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. Black comedy is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or evil elements in human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comedic ways.\n\nA comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the Classical Greek κωμῳδία, which is a compound either of \"κῶμος\" (revel) or \"κώμη\" (village) and \"ᾠδή\" (singing): it is possible that \"κῶμος\" itself is derived from \"κώμη\", and originally meant a village revel. The adjective \"comic\" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\". The word came into modern usage through the Latin \"comoedia \"and Italian \"commedia\" and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.\n\nIn ancient Greece, comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the \"Poetics\", Aristotle states that comedy originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, Aristotle taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for Aristotle is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for Aristotle that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. \n\nOn the contrary, the Greek Philosopher Plato taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In The Republic (Plato), he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nNorthrop Frye described the comic genre as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\", \"The Anatomy of Criticism\". 1957, but this dichotomy is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation. A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.\n\n\nfrom what has been discussed\n\n"}

The rising popularity of Asian films in the 21st century has contributed to the growth of extreme cinema, although extreme cinema is still considered to be a cult-based genre. Being a relatively new genre, extreme cinema is controversial and widely unaccepted by the mainstream media. Extreme cinema films target a specific and small audience group.\n\nThe prehistory of extreme cinema can be traced back to censorship of art films and advertising tactics for classical exploitation films to Anglophone markets alongside later liberal representations of sex in the first half of the 20th Century onwards.\n\nThe name \"extreme cinema\" originated from a “line of Asian films that share a combination of sensational features, such as extreme violence, horror and shocking plots”.\n\nExtreme cinema is highly criticized and debated by film critics and the general public. There have been debates over the hypersexualization that makes these films a threat to the ‘mainstream’ community standards.\n\nThere has also been criticism over the increasing use of violence in modern-day films. Ever since the emergence of slasher-gore films in the ’70s, the rising popularity of extreme cinema has contributed to the casual violence in popular media. Some criticize the easy exposure and unintended targeting of adolescence by extreme cinema films.\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) classifies extreme cinema films into an \"R18\" rating, which is defined as “special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults.”\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "189586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189586", "title": "Fart lighting", "text": "Fart lighting\n\nFart lighting, also known as pyroflatulence or flatus ignition, is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human flatulence, often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a \"blue angel\", \"blue dart\", or in Australia, a \"blue flame\". The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much humorous derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to \"fire fart\", one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter.\n\nIn 1999 author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades, but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury. Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or fraternity houses. With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as YouTube. The people appearing in the videos are predominantly young males. In his book \"The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life\" author Mark Richard Leary explains how a great deal of unhappiness is due to people's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior and that \"stupid stunts\", including lighting flatulence, were a way to make an impression and be included in group bonding or hazing.\n\nAlthough there is little scientific discourse on the combustive properties of flatus, there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in comic routines, movies, and television; including cartoons. In \"Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa\" author Neil Slaven quotes Frank Zappa for calling fart lighting \"The manly art of fart-burning\", and another book quotes the musician Kenny Williams for saying that it demonstrates \"compression, ignition, combustion and exhaust.\"\n\nThere have been documented cases of flatulence during surgery being inadvertently ignited causing patient injury and the risk of death.\n\nThe composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of gases with the following six as major components:\n\nMethane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue hue (ΔH = −891 kJ/mol), as:\n\nHydrogen sulfide also combusts (ΔH = −519 kJ/mol) to\n\nThe odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, skatole, indole, volatile amines and short-chain fatty acids. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.\n\nSome of the gases are produced by bacteria which live in symbiosis within the large intestines of humans and other mammals. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's digestion of food into relatively simpler substances. The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by aerophagy, while the CO component results from the reaction of stomach acids (HCl) with pancreatic bile (NaHCO).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21554680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21554680", "title": "Film director", "text": "Film director\n\nA film director is a person who directs the making of a film. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's budget.\n\nThere are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.\n\nA film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a screenplay into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision. To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production. This entails organizing the film crew in such a way to achieve their vision of the film. This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set. Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew, thus, excellent communication skills are a must.\n\nSince the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary. Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \"a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\". It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.\n\nGenerally, the sole superiors of the director are the producer(s) and the studio that is financing the film. The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular age rating).\n\nDirectors also play an important role in post-production. While the film is still in production, the director sends \"dailies\" to the film editor and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an editor's cut. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the director's cut. Well-established directors have the \"final cut privilege\", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.\n\nThe director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one. It has been said that \"20-hour days are not unusual\". Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.\n\nUnder European Union law, the film director is considered the \"author\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \"auteur\" (the French word for \"author\"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.\n\nSome film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors. Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Jan de Bont, cinematographer on films as \"Die Hard\" and \"Basic Instinct\", directed \"Speed\" and \"Twister\". Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with \"Transcendence\". Other film directors have attended a film school to \"get formal training and education in their craft\". Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film. This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts. Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities. Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production. A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying. Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV. Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works. Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television. The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE.\n\nA handful of top directors made from $133.3 million to $257.95 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. In May 2011, the average United States film director made $92,220.\n\n\ne Other Side of the Camera\", Visible Ink Press, 1999\n"}

In some countries, such as the UK, the term \"gaming\" can also refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional tabletop and digital forms. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube/Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs.\n\nIn the United States, the average video game player is 30 years old and has been playing video games for over 12 years. In the UK as of 2007, the average video game player was over 23 years old, had played video games for over 10 years, and spent around 11 hours a week playing video games. According to Pew Research Center, 49% percent of adults have played a video game at some point in their life. Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'\n\nA female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.\nAccording to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games. Usage of the term \"girl gamer\" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.\n\nAlthough men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a stereotype that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more casual games which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.\n\nA gaymer, or gay gamer, is a person within the group of people who identify themselves as LGBT (gay, bisexual, lesbian, or transgender) and have an active interest in video games. This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys, one in 2006, which noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure, and another in 2009, focusing on the content that gaymers expect in video games.\nThe gaymer community provides a \"safe place\" for LGBT gamers apart from the isolation they feel from both the heteronormative gaming community and the gay community. They also believe that as homosexuality in video games increase, there will be an increased normalization of homosexuality in general. \"Gaymers are the future of video games\" said Hamed Hosseini, who is married to Mahar Buar, in Valve's gaming convention.\n\nIt is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.\n\n\nProfessional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in competitions. A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly South Korea and China, professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than 100,000 a year. In 2006 Major League Gaming contracted several \"Halo 2\" players including Tom \"Tsquared\" Taylor and members of Team Final Boss with $250,000 USD yearly deals.\n\nA retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, retro games—older video games and arcade games. They may also be called \"classic gamers\" or \"old-school gamers\", which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via emulation, or on modern hardware via ports or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).\n\nA number of taxonomies have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.\n\nThe Bartle taxonomy of player types classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\nThe MDA framework describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (\"Mechanics\"), how they build up during game to develop the gameplay (\"Dynamics\"), and what emotional response they convey to the player (\"Aesthetics\"). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. Jesse Schell extends this classification with Anticipation, Schadenfreude, Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.\n\nAn avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a pseudonym) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support, or at electronic sport conventions.\n\nSimilarly, a \"clan tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans. They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another. Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other. A \"team tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team. Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation. These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\nA clan, squad or guild is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator. Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of professional gamers, who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly performativity of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody. These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books. According to Graeme Kirkpatrick, the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with gameplay. Escapist founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"cinemaphile\".\nPeople who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify. Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.\n\nIn August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named Gamergate controversy. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. The Gamergate controversy concerns issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the Twitter hashtag #GamerGate. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.\n\nGames are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time. This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly. Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms. Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics. Market penetration of smartphones with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience, since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.\n\nWhile 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers. This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female PC gamers in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers. Connotations of \"gamer\" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.\n\nRacial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of hispanics identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of African-Americans and 7% of whites. The competitive fighting game scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant. This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a quarter. Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.\n\nCasualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly. Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of gameplay in established genres and franchises. Compared to seminal titles like \"DOOM\", more recent mass-market action games like the Call of Duty series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of interactive movies. The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in retro games but missing from new releases.\n\nThe trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game. According to Brendan Keogh, these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity. Belying these trends, games including \"The Sims\" or \"Minecraft\" have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex. According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are \"just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays \"Counter-Strike\"\" Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.\n\n"}

In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a guest artist. In performance art, the terms guest role or guest star are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a celebrity. The latter is often also credited as special guest star or special musical guest star by some production companies. \n\nIn pop music, guest appearances are often described with the words featuring, with, or and. It is abbreviated in credit lists as feat., ft., f/, or f.. \n\nIn a television series, a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes an entire story arc). \n\nIn radio and television shows, a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity.\n\nGuest appearances have been known in theatre, ballet, and classical music for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of air transport has made this practice much more practical and global.\n\nIn classical music, guest orchestra conductors are a common practice.\n\nGuest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff.\n\nThe duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary contracts for several seasons.\n\nIn the early days of the pop music industry the bands were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, Eric Clapton was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" of the Beatles. Still the term \"featuring\" was used as early as in the July 1954 UK Singles Chart by \"The Four Aces featuring Al Alberts\" with \"Three Coins In The Fountain\" at 5th place.\nGradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in rap music, and this influenced rock musicians as well.\n\nTo have a guest star on a record, the production coordinator must obtain permission from the record label of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label to be printed on the album cover, often in the form \"\"Artist name\", courtesy of \"Record Label name.\"\" The permission is not always granted and sometimes negotiations may take a long time.\n\nA common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion-driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars.\n\nIn rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance.\n\nIn theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star.\n\nCommercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from jet lags to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays.\n\nWith a television series, the appearance of a special guest star could mark the moment when a series \"jumps the shark\"; that is, a doomed attempt to reverse a decline in popularity.\n\n"}

Haynes had been a member of the Globetrotters, but had left the team due to a contract dispute to join the Magicians.

{"id": "23477542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23477542", "title": "History of theatre", "text": "History of theatre\n\nThe history of theatre charts the development of theatre over the past 2,500 years. While performative elements are present in every society, it is customary to acknowledge a distinction between theatre as an art form and entertainment and \"theatrical\" or \"performative\" elements in other activities. The history of theatre is primarily concerned with the origin and subsequent development of the theatre as an autonomous activity. Since classical Athens in the 6th century BC, vibrant traditions of theatre have flourished in cultures across the world.\n\nTheatre arose as a performance of ritual activities that did not require initiation on the part of the spectator. This similarity of early theatre to ritual is negatively attested by Aristotle, who in his \"Poetics\" defined theatre in contrast to the performances of sacred mysteries: theatre did not require the spectator to fast, drink the kykeon, or march in a procession; however theatre did resemble the sacred mysteries in the sense that it brought purification and healing to the spectator by means of a vision, the \"theama\". The physical location of such performances was accordingly named \"theatron\".\n\nAccording to the historians Oscar Brockett and Franklin Hildy, rituals typically include elements that entertain or give pleasure, such as costumes and masks as well as skilled performers. As societies grew more complex, these spectacular elements began to be acted out under non-ritualistic conditions. As this occurred, the first steps towards theatre as an autonomous activity were being taken.\n\nGreek theatre, most developed in Athens, is the root of the Western tradition; \"theatre\" is in origin a Greek word. It was part of a broader culture of theatricality and performance in classical Greece that included festivals, religious rituals, politics, law, athletics and gymnastics, music, poetry, weddings, funerals, and \"symposia\". Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and attendance at the City Dionysia as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of citizenship. Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the rhetoric of orators evidenced in performances in the law-court or political assembly, both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary. The theatre of ancient Greece consisted of three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play.\n\nAthenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state. Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BC, it flowered during the 5th century BC (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world) and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period. No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century have survived. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century it was institutionalised in competitions (\"agon\") held as part of festivities celebrating Dionysos (the god of wine and fertility). As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama), playwrights were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play. The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (\"didaskaliai\") begin from 501 BC, when the satyr play was introduced. Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from Greek mythology, though \"The Persians\"—which stages the Persian response to news of their military defeat at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC—is the notable exception in the surviving drama. When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BC, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive. More than 130 years later, the philosopher Aristotle analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of dramatic theory—his \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BC). Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods, \"Old Comedy\", \"Middle Comedy\", and \"New Comedy\". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of plays by Menander. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of error or ugliness that does not cause pain or destruction.\n\nWestern theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The Roman historian Livy wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BC, with a performance by Etruscan actors. Beacham argues that Romans had been familiar with \"pre-theatrical practices\" for some time before that recorded contact. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of Plautus's broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of Seneca. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BC had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage.\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered Greek drama. From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it. While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.\n\nThe first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama. No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both genres, Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama. By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (\"collegium poetarum\") had been formed.\n\nThe Roman comedies that have survived are all \"fabula palliata\" (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence). In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence). The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping. Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his farces are best known; he was admired for the wit of his dialogue and his use of a variety of poetic meters. All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.\n\nNo early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius. From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are \"fabula crepidata\" (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his \"Phaedra\", for example, was based on Euripides' \"Hippolytus\". Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the \"fabula praetexta\" (tragedies based on Roman subjects), \"Octavia\", but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.\n\nAs the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Eastern Roman Empire, today called the Byzantine Empire. While surviving evidence about Byzantine theatre is slight, existing records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, and other entertainments were very popular. Constantinople had two theatres that were in use as late as the 5th century. However, the true importance of the Byzantines in theatrical history is their preservation of many classical Greek texts and the compilation of a massive encyclopedia called the Suda, from which is derived a large amount of contemporary information on Greek theatre.\n\nFrom the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder that lasted (with a brief period of stability under the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century) until the 10th century. As such, most organized theatrical activities disappeared in Western Europe. While it seems that small nomadic bands traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes. These performers were denounced by the Church during the Dark Ages as they were viewed as dangerous and pagan.\n\nBy the Early Middle Ages, churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations. Symbolic objects and actions – vestments, altars, censers, and pantomime performed by priests – recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into liturgical dramas, the earliest of which is the \"Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis)\" Easter trope, dating from ca. 925. Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, Æthelwold of Winchester composed the \"Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement)\" which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance.\n\nHrosvitha (c. 935 – 973), a canoness in northern Germany, wrote six plays modeled on Terence's comedies but using religious subjects. These six plays – \"Abraham, Callimachus, Dulcitius, Gallicanus, Paphnutius, \"and \"Sapientia\" – are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-classical era. They were first published in 1501 and had considerable influence on religious and didactic plays of the sixteenth century. Hrosvitha was followed by Hildegard of Bingen (d. 1179), a Benedictine abbess, who wrote a Latin musical drama called \"Ordo Virtutum\" in 1155.\n\nAs the Viking invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century, liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy. Only in Muslim-occupied Spain were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all.\n\nThe Feast of Fools was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of burlesque and comedy crept into these performances. Although comic episodes had to truly wait until the separation of drama from the liturgy, the Feast of Fools undoubtedly had a profound effect on the development of comedy in both religious and secular plays.\n\nPerformance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into vernacular and performed by laymen. \"The Mystery of Adam \" (1150) gives credence to this theory as its detailed stage direction suggest that it was staged outdoors. A number of other plays from the period survive, including \"La Seinte Resurrection\" (Norman), \"The Play of the Magi Kings\" (Spanish), and \"Sponsus\" (French).\n\nThe importance of the High Middle Ages in the development of theatre was the economic and political changes that led to the formation of guilds and the growth of towns. This would lead to significant changes in the Late Middle Ages. In the British Isles, plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular Mystery plays were written in cycles of a large number of plays: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and Unknown (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains and clowns.\n\nThe majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. For example, at Valenciennes in 1547, more than 100 roles were assigned to 72 actors. Plays were staged on pageant wagon stages, which were platforms mounted on wheels used to move scenery. Often providing their own costumes, amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. The platform stage, which was an unidentified space and not a specific locale, allowed for abrupt changes in location.\n\nMorality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. The most interesting morality play is \"The Castle of Perseverance\" which depicts mankind's progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is \"Everyman\". Everyman receives Death's summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by Kindred, Goods, and Fellowship – only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave.\n\nThere were also a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is \"The Play of the Greenwood\" by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from France and Germany and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing sex and bodily excretions. The best known playwright of farces is Hans Sachs (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, The Second Shepherds' Play of the Wakefield Cycle is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of John Heywood (1497–1580).\n\nA significant forerunner of the development of Elizabethan drama was the Chambers of Rhetoric in the Low Countries. These societies were concerned with poetry, music and drama and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.\n\nAt the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the Great Hall of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a \"screen\" at the other for the actors. Also important were Mummers' plays, performed during the Christmas season, and court masques. These masques were especially popular during the reign of Henry VIII who had a House of Revels built and an Office of Revels established in 1545.\n\nThe end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.\n\n\"Commedia dell'arte\" troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. It originated in Italy in the 1560s. \"Commedia dell'arte\" was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called \"lazzi\", which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The plays utilised stock characters, which could be divided into three groups: the lovers, the masters, and the servants. The lovers had different names and characteristics in most plays and often were the children of the master. The role of master was normally based on one of three stereotypes: Pantalone, an elderly Venetian merchant; Dottore, Pantalone's friend or rival, a pedantic doctor or lawyer who acted far more intelligent than he really was; and Capitano, who was once a lover character, but evolved into a braggart who boasted of his exploits in love and war, but was often terrifically unskilled in both. He normally carried a sword and wore a cape and feathered headdress. The servant character (called \"zanni\") had only one recurring role: Arlecchino (also called Harlequin). He was both cunning and ignorant, but an accomplished dancer and acrobat. He typically carried a wooden stick with a split in the middle so it made a loud noise when striking something. This \"weapon\" gave us the term \"slapstick\".\n\nA troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid by taking a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the size of their role. The style of theatre was in its peak from 1575 to 1650, but even after that time new scenarios were written and performed. The Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, but since he considered the genre too vulgar, he refined the topics of his own to be more sophisticated. He also wrote several plays based on real events, in which he included \"commedia\" characters.\n\nRenaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as, the mystery plays that formed a part of religious festivals in England and other parts of Europe during the Middle Ages. Other sources include the \"morality plays\" and the \"University drama\" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of \"Commedia dell'arte\", as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre.\n\nSince before the reign of Elizabeth I, companies of players were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage. The tours of these players gradually replaced the performances of the mystery and morality plays by local players, and a 1572 law eliminated the remaining companies lacking formal patronage by labelling them vagabonds.\n\nThe City of London authorities were generally hostile to public performances, but its hostility was overmatched by the Queen's taste for plays and the Privy Council's support. Theatres sprang up in suburbs, especially in the liberty of Southwark, accessible across the Thames to city dwellers but beyond the authority's control. The companies maintained the pretence that their public performances were mere rehearsals for the frequent performances before the Queen, but while the latter did grant prestige, the former were the real source of the income for the professional players.\n\nAlong with the economics of the profession, the character of the drama changed toward the end of the period. Under Elizabeth, the drama was a unified expression as far as social class was concerned: the Court watched the same plays the commoners saw in the public playhouses. With the development of the private theatres, drama became more oriented toward the tastes and values of an upper-class audience. By the later part of the reign of Charles I, few new plays were being written for the public theatres, which sustained themselves on the accumulated works of the previous decades.\n\nPuritan opposition to the stage (informed by the arguments of the early Church Fathers who had written screeds against the decadent and violent entertainments of the Romans) argued not only that the stage in general was pagan, but that any play that represented a religious figure was inherently idolatrous. In 1642, at the outbreak of the English Civil War, the Protestant authorities banned the performance of all plays within the city limits of London. A sweeping assault against the alleged immoralities of the theatre crushed whatever remained in England of the dramatic tradition.\n\nDuring its Golden Age, roughly from 1590 to 1681, Spain saw a monumental increase in the production of live theatre as well as the in importance of theatre within Spanish society. It was an accessible art form for all participants in Renaissance Spain, being both highly sponsored by the aristocratic class and highly attended by the lower classes. The volume and variety of Spanish plays during the Golden Age was unprecedented in the history of world theatre, surpassing, for example, the dramatic production of the English Renaissance by a factor of at least four. Although this volume has been as much a source of criticism as praise for Spanish Golden Age theatre, for emphasizing quantity before quality, a large number of the 10,000 to 30,000 plays of this period are still considered masterpieces.\n\nMajor artists of the period included Lope de Vega, a contemporary of Shakespeare, often, and contemporaneously, seen his parallel for the Spanish stage, and Calderon de la Barca, inventor of the zarzuela and Lope's successor as the preeminent Spanish dramatist. Gil Vicente, Lope de Rueda, and Juan del Encina helped to establish the foundations of Spanish theatre in the mid-sixteenth centuries, while Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla and Tirso de Molina made significant contributions in the later half of the Golden Age. Important performers included Lope de Rueda (previously mentioned among the playwrights) and later Juan Rana.\n\nThe sources of influence for the emerging national theatre of Spain were as diverse as the theatre that nation ended up producing. Storytelling traditions originating in Italian Commedia dell'arte and the uniquely Spanish expression of Western Europe's traveling minstrel entertainments contributed a populist influence on the narratives and the music, respectively, of early Spanish theatre. Neo-Aristotelian criticism and liturgical dramas, on the other hand, contributed literary and moralistic perspectives. In turn, Spanish Golden Age theatre has dramatically influenced the theatre of later generations in Europe and throughout the world. Spanish drama had an immediate and significant impact on the contemporary developments in English Renaissance theatre. It has also had a lasting impact on theatre throughout the Spanish speaking world. Additionally, a growing number of works are being translated, increasing the reach of Spanish Golden Age theatre and strengthening its reputation among critics and theatre patrons.\n\nNotable playwrights:\n\nAfter public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. With the restoration of the monarch in 1660 came the restoration of and the reopening of the theatre. English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called \"Restoration comedy\". Restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness, a quality encouraged by Charles II (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish aristocratic ethos of his court. For the first time women were allowed to act, putting an end to the practice of the boy-player taking the parts of women. Socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. Restoration audiences liked to see good triumph in their tragedies and rightful government restored. In comedy they liked to see the love-lives of the young and fashionable, with a central couple bringing their courtship to a successful conclusion (often overcoming the opposition of the elders to do so). Heroines had to be chaste, but were independent-minded and outspoken; now that they were played by women, there was more mileage for the playwright in disguising them in men's clothes or giving them narrow escape from rape. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. To non-theatre-goers these comedies were widely seen as licentious and morally suspect, holding up the antics of a small, privileged, and decadent class for admiration. This same class dominated the audiences of the Restoration theatre. This period saw the first professional woman playwright, Aphra Behn.\n\nAs a reaction to the decadence of Charles II era productions, sentimental comedy grew in popularity. This genre focused on encouraging virtuous behavior by showing middle class characters overcoming a series of moral trials. Playwrights like Colley Cibber and Richard Steele believed that humans were inherently good but capable of being led astray. Through plays such as The Conscious Lovers and Love's Last Shift they strove to appeal to an audience's noble sentiments in order that viewers could be reformed.\n\nThe Restoration spectacular, or elaborately staged \"machine play\", hit the London public stage in the late 17th-century Restoration period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable scenery, baroque illusionistic painting, gorgeous costumes, and special effects such as trapdoor tricks, \"flying\" actors, and fireworks. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, \"legitimate\" Restoration drama; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.\n\nBasically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century court masque, though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from French opera, the spectaculars are sometimes called \"English opera\". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all. Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term \"opera\", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover Samuel Pepys. The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as John Dryden's \"Albion and Albanius\" would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like Thomas Shadwell's \"Psyche\" or Dryden's \"King Arthur\" would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.\n\nNeoclassicism was the dominant form of theatre in the 18th century. It demanded decorum and rigorous adherence to the classical unities. Neoclassical theatre as well as the time period is characterized by its grandiosity. The costumes and scenery were intricate and elaborate. The acting is characterized by large gestures and melodrama. Neoclassical theatre encompasses the Restoration, Augustan, and Johnstinian Ages. In one sense, the neo-classical age directly follows the time of the Renaissance.\n\nTheatres of the early 18th century – sexual farces of the Restoration were superseded by politically satirical comedies, 1737 Parliament passed the Stage Licensing Act which introduced state censorship of public performances and limited the number of theatres in London to two.\n\nTheatre in the 19th century is divided into two parts: early and late. The early period was dominated by melodrama and Romanticism.\n\nBeginning in France, melodrama became the most popular theatrical form. August von Kotzebue's \"Misanthropy and Repentance\" (1789) is often considered the first melodramatic play. The plays of Kotzebue and René Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt established melodrama as the dominant dramatic form of the early 19th century.\n\nIn Germany, there was a trend toward historic accuracy in costumes and settings, a revolution in theatre architecture, and the introduction of the theatrical form of German Romanticism. Influenced by trends in 19th-century philosophy and the visual arts, German writers were increasingly fascinated with their Teutonic past and had a growing sense of nationalism. The plays of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, and other \"Sturm und Drang\" playwrights, inspired a growing faith in feeling and instinct as guides to moral behavior.\nIn Britain, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron were the most important dramatists of their time (although Shelley's plays were not performed until later in the century). In the minor theatres, burletta and melodrama were the most popular. Kotzebue's plays were translated into English and Thomas Holcroft's \"A Tale of Mystery\" was the first of many English melodramas. Pierce Egan, Douglas William Jerrold, Edward Fitzball, and John Baldwin Buckstone initiated a trend towards more contemporary and rural stories in preference to the usual historical or fantastical melodramas. James Sheridan Knowles and Edward Bulwer-Lytton established a \"gentlemanly\" drama that began to re-establish the former prestige of the theatre with the aristocracy.\n\nThe later period of the 19th century saw the rise of two conflicting types of drama: realism and non-realism, such as Symbolism and precursors of Expressionism.\n\nRealism began earlier in the 19th century in Russia than elsewhere in Europe and took a more uncompromising form. Beginning with the plays of Ivan Turgenev (who used \"domestic detail to reveal inner turmoil\"), Aleksandr Ostrovsky (who was Russia's first professional playwright), Aleksey Pisemsky (whose \"A Bitter Fate\" (1859) anticipated Naturalism), and Leo Tolstoy (whose \"The Power of Darkness\" (1886) is \"one of the most effective of naturalistic plays\"), a tradition of psychological realism in Russia culminated with the establishment of the Moscow Art Theatre by Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko.\n\nThe most important theatrical force in later 19th-century Germany was that of Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his Meiningen Ensemble, under the direction of Ludwig Chronegk. The Ensemble's productions are often considered the most historically accurate of the 19th century, although his primary goal was to serve the interests of the playwright. The Meiningen Ensemble stands at the beginning of the new movement toward unified production (or what Richard Wagner would call the \"Gesamtkunstwerk\") and the rise of the director (at the expense of the actor) as the dominant artist in theatre-making.\n\nNaturalism, a theatrical movement born out of Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" (1859) and contemporary political and economic conditions, found its main proponent in Émile Zola. The realisation of Zola's ideas was hindered by a lack of capable dramatists writing naturalist drama. André Antoine emerged in the 1880s with his \"Théâtre Libre\" that was only open to members and therefore was exempt from censorship. He quickly won the approval of Zola and began to stage Naturalistic works and other foreign realistic pieces.\nIn Britain, melodramas, light comedies, operas, Shakespeare and classic English drama, Victorian burlesque, pantomimes, translations of French farces and, from the 1860s, French operettas, continued to be popular. So successful were the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, such as \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1878) and \"The Mikado\" (1885), that they greatly expanded the audience for musical theatre. This, together with much improved street lighting and transportation in London and New York led to a late Victorian and Edwardian theatre building boom in the West End and on Broadway. Later, the work of Henry Arthur Jones and Arthur Wing Pinero initiated a new direction on the English stage. While their work paved the way, the development of more significant drama owes itself most to the playwright Henrik Ibsen.\n\nIbsen was born in Norway in 1828. He wrote twenty-five plays, the most famous of which are \"A Doll's House\" (1879), \"Ghosts\" (1881), \"The Wild Duck\" (1884), and \"Hedda Gabler\" (1890). In addition, his works \"Rosmersholm\" (1886) and \"When We Dead Awaken\" (1899) evoke a sense of mysterious forces at work in human destiny, which was to be a major theme of symbolism and the so-called \"Theatre of the Absurd\".\n\nAfter Ibsen, British theatre experienced revitalization with the work of George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, John Galsworthy, William Butler Yeats, and Harley Granville Barker. Unlike most of the gloomy and intensely serious work of their contemporaries, Shaw and Wilde wrote primarily in the comic form. Edwardian musical comedies were extremely popular, appealing to the tastes of the middle class in the Gay Nineties and catering to the public's preference for escapist entertainment during World War 1.\n\nWhile much 20th-century theatre continued and extended the projects of realism and Naturalism, there was also a great deal of experimental theatre that rejected those conventions. These experiments form part of the modernist and postmodernist movements and included forms of political theatre as well as more aesthetically orientated work. Examples include: Epic theatre, the Theatre of Cruelty, and the so-called \"Theatre of the Absurd\".\n\nThe term theatre practitioner came to be used to describe someone who both creates theatrical performances and who produces a theoretical discourse that informs their practical work. A theatre practitioner may be a director, a dramatist, an actor, or—characteristically—often a combination of these traditionally separate roles. \"Theatre practice\" describes the collective work that various theatre practitioners do. It is used to describe theatre praxis from Konstantin Stanislavski's development of his 'system', through Vsevolod Meyerhold's biomechanics, Bertolt Brecht's epic and Jerzy Grotowski's poor theatre, down to the present day, with contemporary theatre practitioners including Augusto Boal with his Theatre of the Oppressed, Dario Fo's popular theatre, Eugenio Barba's theatre anthropology and Anne Bogart's viewpoints.\n\nOther key figures of 20th-century theatre include: Antonin Artaud, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, Frank Wedekind, Maurice Maeterlinck, Federico García Lorca, Eugene O'Neill, Luigi Pirandello, George Bernard Shaw, Gertrude Stein, Ernst Toller, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Heiner Müller, and Caryl Churchill.\n\nA number of aesthetic movements continued or emerged in the 20th century, including:\n\nAfter the great popularity of the British Edwardian musical comedies, the American musical theatre came to dominate the musical stage, beginning with the Princess Theatre musicals, followed by the works of the Gershwin brothers, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Rodgers and Hart, and later Rodgers and Hammerstein.\n\nThe earliest recorded quasi-theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the \"passion plays\" of Ancient Egypt. The story of the god Osiris was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization.\n\nModern theatre in Ghana emerged in the early 20th century.\nIt emerged first as literary comment on the colonization of Africa by Europe. Among the earliest work in which this can be seen is \"The Blinkards\" written by Kobina Sekyi in 1915. \"The Blinkards\" is a blatant satire about the Africans who embraced the European culture that was brought to them. In it Sekyi demeans three groups of individuals: anyone European, anyone who imitates the Europeans, and the rich African cocoa farmer. This sudden rebellion though was just the beginning spark of Ghanaian literary theater.\n\nA play that has similarity in its satirical view is \"Anowa\". Written by Ghanaian author Ama Ata Aidoo, it begins with its eponymous heroine Anowa rejecting her many arranged suitors' marriage proposals. She insists on making her own decisions as to whom she is going to marry. The play stresses the need for gender equality, and respect for women. This ideal of independence, as well as equality leads Anowa down a winding path of both happiness and misery. Anowa chooses a man of her own to marry. Anowa supports her husband Kofi both physically and emotionally. Through her support Kofi does prosper in wealth, but becomes poor as a spiritual being. Through his accumulation of wealth Kofi loses himself in it. His once happy marriage with Anowa becomes changed when he begins to hire slaves rather than doing any labor himself. This to Anowa does not make sense because it makes Kofi no better than the European colonists whom she detests for the way that she feels they have used the people of Africa. Their marriage is childless, which is presumed to have been caused by a ritual that Kofi has done trading his manhood for wealth. Anowa's viewing Kofi's slave-gotten wealth and inability to have a child leads to her committing suicide. The name Anowa means \"Superior moral force\" while Kofi's means only \"Born on Friday\". This difference in even the basis of their names seems to implicate the moral superiority of women in a male run society.\n\nAnother play of significance is \"The Marriage of Anansewa\", written in 1975 by Efua Sutherland. The entire play is based upon an Akan oral tradition called \"Anansesem\"(folk tales). The main character of the play is Ananse (the spider). The qualities of Ananse are one of the most prevalent parts of the play. Ananse is cunning, selfish, has great insight into human and animal nature, is ambitious, eloquent, and resourceful. By putting too much of himself into everything that he does Ananse ruins each of his schemes and ends up poor. Ananse is used in the play as a kind of Everyman. He is written in an exaggerated sense in order to force the process of self-examination. Ananse is used as a way to spark a conversation for change in the society of anyone reading. The play tells of Ananse attempting to marry off his daughter Anansewa off to any of a selection of rich chiefs, or another sort of wealthy suitor simultaneously, in order to raise money. Eventually all the suitors come to his house at once, and he has to use all of his cunning to defuse the situation. The storyteller not only narrates but also enacts, reacts to, and comments on the action of the tale. Along with this, Mbuguous is used, Mbuguous is the name given to very specialized sect of Ghanaian theatre technique that allows for audience participation. The Mbuguous of this tale are songs that embellish the tale or comment on it. Spontaneity through this technique as well as improvisation are used enough to meet any standard of modern theatre.\n\nIn his pioneering study of Yoruba theatre, Joel Adedeji traced its origins to the masquerade of the Egungun (the \"cult of the ancestor\"). The traditional ceremony culminates in the essence of the masquerade where it is deemed that ancestors return to the world of the living to visit their descendants. In addition to its origin in ritual, Yoruba theatre can be \"traced to the 'theatrogenic' nature of a number of the deities in the Yoruba pantheon, such as Obatala the arch divinity, Ogun the divinity of creativeness, as well as Iron and technology, and Sango the divinity of the storm\", whose reverence is imbued \"with drama and theatre and the symbolic overall relevance in terms of its relative interpretation.\"\n\nThe Aláàrìnjó theatrical tradition sprang from the Egungun masquerade in the 16th century. The Aláàrìnjó was a troupe of traveling performers whose masked forms carried an air of mystique. They created short, satirical scenes that drew on a number of established stereotypical characters. Their performances utilised mime, music and acrobatics. The Aláàrìnjó tradition influenced the popular traveling theatre, which was the most prevalent and highly developed form of theatre in Nigeria from the 1950s to the 1980s. In the 1990s, the popular traveling theatre moved into television and film and now gives live performances only rarely.\n\n\"Total theatre\" also developed in Nigeria in the 1950s. It utilised non-Naturalistic techniques, surrealistic physical imagery, and exercised a flexibile use of language. Playwrights writing in the mid-1970s made use of some of these techniques, but articulated them with \"a radical appreciation of the problems of society.\"\n\nTraditional performance modes have strongly influenced the major figures in contemporary Nigerian theatre. The work of Hubert Ogunde (sometimes referred to as the \"father of contemporary Yoruban theatre\") was informed by the Aláàrìnjó tradition and Egungun masquerades. Wole Soyinka, who is \"generally recognized as Africa's greatest living playwright\", gives the divinity Ogun a complex metaphysical significance in his work. In his essay \"The Fourth Stage\" (1973), Soyinka contrasts Yoruba drama with classical Athenian drama, relating both to the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's analysis of the latter in \"The Birth of Tragedy\" (1872). Ogun, he argues, is \"a totality of the Dionysian, Apollonian and Promethean virtues.\"\n\nThe proponents of the travelling theatre in Nigeria include Duro Ladipo and Moses Olaiya (a popular comic act). These practitioners contributed much to the field of African theatre during the period of mixture and experimentation of the indigenous with the Western theatre.\n\nThe history of African-American theatre has a dual origin. The first is rooted in local theatre where African Americans performed in cabins and parks. Their performances (folk tales, songs, music, and dance) were rooted in the African culture before being influenced by the American environment. African Grove Theatre was the first African-American theatre established in 1821 by William Henry Brown \n\nThe earliest form of Indian theatre was the Sanskrit theatre. It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century and flourished between the 1st century and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written. With the Islamic conquests that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely. Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Modern Indian theatre developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.\n\nThe earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century. The wealth of archaeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre. The \"Vedas\" (the earliest Indian literature, from between 1500 and 600 BC) contain no hint of it; although a small number of hymns are composed in a form of dialogue), the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The \"Mahābhāṣya\" by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama. This treatise on grammar from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.\n\nHowever, although there are no surviving fragments of any drama prior to this date, it is possible that early Buddhist literature provides the earliest evidence for the existence of Indian theatre. The Pali suttas (ranging in date from the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE) refer to the existence of troupes of actors (led by a chief actor), who performed dramas on a stage. It is indicated that these dramas incorporated dance, but were listed as a distinct form of performance, alongside dancing, singing, and story recitations. (According to later Buddhist texts, King Bimbisara, a contemporary of Gautama Buddha, had a drama performed for another king. This would be as early as the 5th century BCE, but the event is only described in much later texts, from the 3rd-4th centuries CE.)\n\nThe major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is \"A Treatise on Theatre\" (\"Nātyaśāstra\"), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The \"Treatise\" is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre. In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.\n\nUnder the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (\"sutradhara\"), who may also have acted. This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a puppeteer—the literal meaning of \"sutradhara\" is \"holder of the strings or threads\". The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique. There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played character their own age, while others played those different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the \"Treatise\" gives most attention to acting (\"abhinaya\"), which consists of two styles: realistic (\"lokadharmi\") and conventional (\"natyadharmi\"), though the major focus is on the latter.\n\nIts drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature. It utilised stock characters, such as the hero (\"nayaka\"), heroine (\"nayika\"), or clown (\"vidusaka\"). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. Kālidāsa in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient India's greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the \"Mālavikāgnimitram\" (\"Mālavikā and Agnimitra\"), \"Vikramuurvashiiya\" (\"Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi\"), and \"Abhijñānaśākuntala\" (\"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"). The last was inspired by a story in the \"Mahabharata\" and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into English and German. \"Śakuntalā\" (in English translation) influenced Goethe's \"Faust\" (1808–1832).\n\nThe next great Indian dramatist was Bhavabhuti (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: \"Malati-Madhava\", \"Mahaviracharita\" and \"Uttar Ramacharita\". Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of \"Ramayana\". The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy \"Ratnavali\", \"Priyadarsika\", and the Buddhist drama \"Nagananda\".\n\nKathakali is a highly stylised classical Indian dance-drama noted for the attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures, and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. It originated in the country's present-day state of Kerala during the 17th century and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined gestures and added themes besides more ornate singing and precise drumming.\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed. His plays are written in Bengali and include \"Chitra\" (\"Chitrangada\", 1892), \"The King of the Dark Chamber\" (\"Raja\", 1910), \"The Post Office\" (\"Dakghar\", 1913), and \"Red Oleander\" (\"Raktakarabi\", 1924).\n\nThere are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the Shang Dynasty; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty is sometimes known as 'The Age of 1000 Entertainments'. During this era, Emperor Xuanzong formed an acting school known as the Children of the Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.\n\nIn the Song dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan dynasty into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure.\n\nYuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.\n\nDuring the 333-year reign of the Spanish government, they introduced into the islands the Catholic religion and the Spanish way of life, which gradually merged with the indigenous culture to form the “lowland folk culture” now shared by the major ethnolinguistic groups. \nToday, the dramatic forms introduced or influenced by Spain continue to live in rural areas all over the archipelago. These forms include the komedya, the playlets, the sinakulo, the sarswela, and the drama. In recent years, some of these forms have been revitalized to make them more responsive to the conditions and needs of a developing nation.\n\nIn Thailand, it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic \"Ramakien\", a version of the Indian \"Ramayana\", remains popular in Thailand even today.\n\nIn Cambodia, at the ancient capital Angkor Wat, stories from the Indian epics \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at Borobudur in Indonesia.\n\nDuring the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, Zeami Motokiyo (1363–1443) who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan'ami's company performed for Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), the Shōgun of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today Noh. A mixture of pantomime and vocal acrobatics, this style has fascinated the Japanese for hundreds of years.\n\nJapan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616). However, alarmed at increasing Christian growth, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as Bunraku). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about 1/3d the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his career, most of which are still used today. They wore masks instead of elaborate makeup. Masks define their gender, personality, and moods the actor is in.\n\nKabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of Kabuki's material came from Nõ and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, Kabuki is less formal and more distant than Nõ, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, Kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.\n\nButoh is the collective name for a diverse range of activities, techniques and motivations for dance, performance, or movement inspired by the movement. It typically involves playful and grotesque imagery, taboo topics, extreme or absurd environments, and is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper-controlled motion, with or without an audience. There is no set style, and it may be purely conceptual with no movement at all. Its origins have been attributed to Japanese dance legends Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno. Butoh appeared first in Japan following World War II and specifically after student riots. The roles of authority were now subject to challenge and subversion. It also appeared as a reaction against the contemporary dance scene in Japan, which Hijikata felt was based on the one hand on imitating the West and on the other on imitating the Noh. He critiqued the current state of dance as overly superficial.\n\nThe most popular forms of theatre in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as \"ta'ziya\", in which actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the \"shaheed\" (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Secular plays known as \"akhraja\" were recorded in medieval \"adab\" literature, though they were less common than puppetry and \"ta'ziya\" theatre.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2241587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241587", "title": "Inspector Gadget", "text": "Inspector Gadget\n\nInspector Gadget is a media franchise that began in 1983 with the DIC Entertainment animated television series \"Inspector Gadget\". Since the original series, there have been many spin-offs based on the show, including additional animated series, video games and films.\n\nThe franchise follows the adventures of a powerful but dimwitted cyborg police inspector named Gadget as he investigates the criminal schemes of Dr. Claw and his organization, MAD, as they fruitlessly attempt to stop him. However, neither side is aware that it is Gadget's niece, Penny, and her dog, Brain, who are truly responsible for thwarting MAD.\n\nThe main protagonist and titular character of the franchise. Gadget is a cyborg (part man, part machine) with thousands of high-tech gadgets installed in his body. Gadget is very powerful and loyal to his career as a lawman, but he is also very dim-witted, clueless, incompetent, oblivious, and gullible, but also lovable, caring, and protective. His attire and personality resembles that of Inspector Clouseau from \"The Pink Panther\" movies. While Penny and Brain secretly do all the real detective work, Gadget has a knack of inadvertently saving the day, usually without realizing he is doing so. Gadget loves his family more than anything and would do anything to keep them from harm, especially Penny. He was voiced by Don Adams in the original series and \"Inspector Gadget's Field Trip\" until Adams' retirement from voicing Gadget in 1999, Gary Owens and later Jesse White in the original series' pilot episode, and Maurice LaMarche in the \"Super Mario Bros. Super Show\", \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", the direct-to-video animated films, and various DIC Kids Network bumpers. For the 2015 series, the voice of Gadget is provided by Ivan Sherry. In Disney's live-action films, Gadget's real name is John Brown. He is portrayed by Matthew Broderick in the first film and French Stewart in the sequel.\n\nDr. Claw is the main antagonist of the franchise. He is the leader of an evil crime syndicate called MAD. Only his arms are shown, wearing silver gauntlets with golden spiked wrist bands. A parody of Ernst Stavro Blofeld from the James Bond franchise, his face is never seen at all (except in the live action film) with only his hands and pet cat visible. On a Dr. Claw action figure, the face was covered by a sticker on the box, which meant the toy had to be bought for his face to be seen. He is ruthless, murderous, sinister, dark, sadistic, and greedy, and will do anything to rule the world and destroy Gadget. In \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", he reveals that he thinks Gadget's idiocy is an act to taunt him. In the 2015 series, he is noticeably less competent and malicious and the crimes he commits are a lot more petty. He has been voiced by Frank Welker, Brian Drummond, and Martin Roach. In the first live action film, where he is portrayed by Rupert Everett, his name is revealed to be Sanford Scolex. Tony Martin subsequently took over the role of Dr. Claw in the sequel.\n\nPenny is Gadget's intelligent niece and the one who really stops Claw's evil schemes. She uses many high tech devices to help her secretly solve the cases and stop the bad guys such as; a computer book, a video watch, a laptop, and a holographic tablet. However, her meddling often leads to her getting captured by the bad guys, which leaves Brain to rescue her. She is 10 in the original series, 12 in \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", 16 in \"Biggest Caper Ever\", and 14 and 15 in the 2015 series. Penny loves her uncle more than anything, which is why she is always ready to help him behind his back, but on a few occasions she gets annoyed by his stupidity. In \"Biggest Caper Ever\", she is notably more selfish and unlike any other incarnation, she doesn't try to help her uncle at all. In the 2015 series, she has become an agent in training and is more physically active than in previous incarnations and she has a crush on Claw's nephew, Talon.\nFor the original series, her voice was portrayed by Mona Marshall in the pilot episode, Cree Summer in the first season, and Holly Berger in the second season. Erica Horn provided her voice in \"Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas\". From 2001 to 2005, she was voiced by Tegan Moss. Tara Strong voices her in the 2015 series. For the live action film, she was portrayed by Michelle Trachtenberg, and Caitlin Wachs in the sequel.\n\nBrain is Penny's pet dog and adopted brother. He is the only one who knows that Penny is the one who really saves the world. Brain usually has the job of keeping Gadget safe on his missions while Penny investigates M.A.D's crimes. He usually disguises himself when following Gadget, which often causes Gadget to think he's a M.A.D Agent. He is absent in \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\" and only shows up in pictures. The reason given for why he is absent is because after all the years of secretly helping Gadget, he has become phobic of gadgets, the Inspector, and the word itself. He ran away to a riverside shack to get away from Gadget. He returned in the episode, \"No Brainer\", where Penny made him a translation collar in order to help find Gadget. However, he does return in later spinoffs.\nHis voice was played in the original series by Frank Welker, Maurice LaMarche in \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", and Scott McCord in the 2015 series. Lee Tockar voiced him in \"Biggest Caper Ever\". In the live action films, he was first voiced by Don Adams, Inspector Gadget's original voice actor, and then by Jeff Bennett in the sequel.\n\nChief Quimby is Gadget's boss and the chief of police. He usually pops up near the beginning of each episode to give Gadget a sheet of paper describing his mission. Once Gadget finishes reading them, the paper self-destructs and blows up in Quimby's face in a parody of . He appears at the end to congratulate Gadget and give him full credit for stopping Claw. He never knows that Penny did all the work, even though she always calls him. In \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\", he has become an agent for the CIA. In the 2015 series, he is given glasses, and his hair is blonde instead of brown.\nHis voice in the original series was provided by John Stephenson in the pilot, Dan Hennessey in the first season, and Maurice LaMarche for the remainder of the series. Jim Byrnes voiced him in \"Inspector Gadget's Last Case\". He is voiced by Derek McGrath in the 2015 series. In the live action films, he was first portrayed by Dabney Coleman, and Mark Mitchell in the sequel.\n\nThe original animated television series in the franchise, \"Inspector Gadget\", debuted in 1983 and introduced audiences to the adventures of a clumsy, simple-witted bionic detective named Inspector Gadget – a human being with various bionic gadgets built into his body. Gadget's nemesis is Doctor Claw, the leader of an evil organization, known as \"M.A.D.\"\n\n\"Inspector Gadget\" was the first cartoon show from DiC Entertainment to be produced directly for syndication. Its two seasons originally ran from 1983 to 1986 and remained in syndication into the late 1990s. It continues to air successfully in reruns around the world.\n\nIn 1992, DiC produced an animated Christmas special based on the series, \"Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas.\" In the special, Dr. Claw has locked up Santa Claus at the North Pole and hypnotized his elves, forcing them to break all toys that are being produced. Inspector Gadget, Penny, and Brain travel to the North Pole in an attempt to stop Dr. Claw and save Christmas. This special was nominated for an Emmy. Don Adams, Frank Welker, Erica Horn and Maurice LaMarche provide the voices for the characters.\n\nThe 1995 \"Gadget Boy and Heather\" series was a spin off from the original show. The series is about a younger version of Gadget, \"Gadget Boy\" (also voiced by Don Adams). Instead of Penny and Brain the Dog, Gadget Boy was assisted by the resourceful Heather (voiced by Tara Strong). Just as maladroit as his adult self is, Gadget Boy was usually bailed out of situations by the more practical Heather, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs. In this series, traditional nemesis Dr. Claw was replaced by the villainess Spydra. In addition, the chief, Strombolli had a \"fax tie\" that exploded after the mission was read, continuing the running gag from the original series in which Chief Quimby would get blown up by an exploding message.\n\nTwo years later, in 1997, \"Gadget Boy & Heather\" spawned an educational spinoff, \"Gadget Boy's Adventures in History\", which aired on The History Channel. This series marked the last time Don Adams would perform a voice role for an animated Gadget series two years before his retirement from voicing an animated Gadget in 1999 and eight years before his death in 2005.\n\nIn 1996, Gadget took students around the world in this series of 50 field trips, mainly created to market to stations to fulfill the FCC E/I requirements. The show put an animated Inspector Gadget on top of live-action filming of the locations that Gadget guided viewers through. Don Adams returned as Gadget's voice while Penny, Brain, Chief Quimby, Capeman and Dr. Claw are entirely absent.\n\nIn 2002, the French studio SIP Animation (Saban International Paris), in cooperation with DiC, produced 52 episodes of the new TV series \"Gadget and the Gadgetinis.\" The series debuted on the French channel M6 in September 2002 and was aired on Fox Kids channels across Europe from 2003. It has never been broadcast or released in the United States.\n\nInspector Gadget (again voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is now a member of an organization called \"WOMP\" (World Organization of Mega Powers) and is now, Lieutenant Gadget. He is still aided in his work by Penny (who is now twelve years old), as well as the new robot characters Digit and Fidget, the titular Gadgetinis invented by Penny, due to Brain running away. It follows the same plot as the original series, with the dim witted Gadget attempting to fight crime on his own, while Penny and her helpers secretly do all the work. Doctor Claw, now with the first name George, returns as the main villain, with his relatives introduced in some episodes. In some stories, he is replaced by other villains.\n\nThe production values of this series were higher than any of the previous revivals and spinoff series. Also, the original creators of \"Inspector Gadget\" were all involved: Andy Heyward was one of the executive producers; Jean Chalopin wrote or co-wrote all the episodes, in addition to being credited as the new show's creator; whereas Bruno Bianchi directed and produced the series.\n\nA new CGI-animated \"Inspector Gadget\" TV series has been in development since at least the start of 2012, possibly earlier. It was commissioned by Teletoon Canada, which will air the show, and put into preproduction by The Cookie Jar Company. In January 2012, the in-development show was mentioned by Ray Sharma, the CEO of XMG Studio, which produced the hit mobile game \"Inspector Gadget: M.A.D. Dash\". Sharma described how the success of the game had resulted in a new TV series being in the making: \"We did 1 million downloads in a week, and it's reinvigorated the TV brand with a new TV series in production.\"\n\nIn September 2012, Cookie Jar issued a short press release about the upcoming series, as part of the advertising for it during the MIPCOM market that October, stating: \"Cookie Jar Entertainment is celebrating Inspector Gadget’s 30th anniversary with the launch of a brand-new series with its Canadian broadcast partner TELETOON. The series will again revolve around the iconic bionic bumbling detective.\" On June 9, 2013, Teletoon officially announced the reboot show with two press pictures of Gadget's new look as well as a press release: \"MAD Agents, look out! Criminals, beware! Bystanders … take cover! Inspector Gadget is back to battle Dr. Claw with all-new gadgets – and all-new gadget-related chaos. But the loveable, bumbling, accidentally-destructive Inspector is not alone in the fight to take down MAD. His ever trusty police-dog, Brain, is still by his side and he's getting extra crime-fighting help from his new partner, Inspector-in-training Penny (voiced by Tara Strong). With MAD more powerful than ever and with the arrival of Dr. Claw's evil-genius (and totally crush-worthy) nephew, Penny and Brain will need to use every ounce of their training to keep the world safe from Dr. Claw … and Gadget.\"\n\nUnlike the other shows, Penny is more of the protagonist and Dr. Claw is as incompetent and useless as Gadget (if not more so). The series is being produced by DHX Media, which purchased Cookie Jar in 2012. According to a DHX Media distribution catalogue released as a PDF on January 15, 2014, the show premiered in 2015 on Netflix.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, it was announced that the series has 26 episodes and that it would air on Boomerang's international channels in 2015. The series premiered on Boomerang in Australia on January 5, 2015.\n\n\"Inspector Gadget\" was adapted into a 1999 live-action film by Walt Disney Pictures, starring Matthew Broderick as the title character and Rupert Everett as Doctor Claw. As opposed to the animated series, where Gadget is bumbling and clueless and Claw's face is never shown, Gadget appears to be more reliable and competent in detective work and Claw's face appears many times in the film.\n\nA second film, \"Inspector Gadget 2\" featured many changes from the first one, such as Doctor Bradford no longer assisting Gadget or being his romantic interest, instead being replaced by a well-meaning and upbeat scientist named Baxter. Being a year later in the movie's timeline, Gadget had begun displaying his cartoon namesake's glitches by receiving the wrong gadget when he calls out a specific device. He falls in love with his intended replacement: the fully robotic G2. Furthermore, none of the cast from the first film returned to their roles except D.L. Hughley.\n\nDisney and Lin Pictures are making a third movie with Dan Lin producing.\n\nReleased on VHS in 1999 to coincide with Disney's live-action theatrical film, \"Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets\" takes the format of a clip show in which Gadget has a flashback to his past adventures in the original TV series, using footage from the episodes \"The Capeman Cometh\", \"Prince of the Gypsies\", and \"Gadget's Gadgets\"; as well as some stock footage from \"Inspector Gadget's Field Trip\" for the present-day segments. Maurice LaMarche did Inspector Gadget's voice in the modern segments, marking his first cartoon voice appearance as Gadget, who had previously been voiced by Don Adams. Original series actors Cree Summer and Frank Welker voiced Penny and Dr Claw in the modern segments.\n\nIn 2002, DiC released a full-length animated feature film called \"Inspector Gadget's Last Case\", directed by Michael Maliani. It premiered on television on \"Nickelodeon Sunday Movie Toons\" and was released on DVD and VHS shortly afterward by MGM Home Entertainment. The film is about Lt. Gadget giving up his beloved but aging Gadgetmobile, while his archenemy Dr. Claw uses a competing crime fighter to discredit Gadget and cost him his badge. Penny and Brain make appearances as minor supporting characters. In this, Gadget is more competent, yet he is still bumbling, similar to his persona in the pilot episode and his Mathew Broderick counterpart. This film uses the same character designs as the concurrent \"Gadget & The Gadgetinis\" TV series, which debuted on the French channel M6 and the UK's Channel 5 in the fall of 2002. Maurice LaMarche reprised the role of Gadget in this film and Jaleel White voiced Gadgetmobile. In Germany, the film aired on Cartoon Network.\n\n2005's \"Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever\" was the first \"Inspector Gadget\" animated production to be completely rendered using 3D computer animation. It returned Gadget to his familiar trenchcoat from the original series. Brain is also back in his old role, while Penny is now 16 years old. Gadget is again voiced by Maurice LaMarche and Penny and Claw are once again voiced by Tegan Moss and Brian Drummond, while Bernie Mac voices the Gadgetmobile. The plot features Dr. Claw breaking out of jail with the help of a specially hired Scottish agent named Bombaboy. He and Bombaboy seek out a pterodactyl to get revenge on his captors and launch yet another scheme to conquer the world. It was originally intended to be the first in a series of several animated \"Inspector Gadget\" movies, but apparently due to weak sales, no subsequent films were released.\n\nThe first game developed based on the series was \"Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear\" developed by Beam Software and scheduled for release by Melbourne House in the UK in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It resembled the arcade title Metro-Cross and was a left-to-right scrolling racing/jumping game with a quasi-isometric forced 3d perspective. Although the game was completed, and preview copies were reviewed (unfavourably) in the computing press, it was scrapped on the verge of release. The game featured a cameo by the titular character from the Horace series of games. An adventure game based on the series, \"\" was eventually released on the PC in 1990 by a company called Azeroth.\n\nAn LCD Electronic \"Inspector Gadget\" developed by Bandai was released in 1984.\n\nAn NES game was planned for release by Hudson Soft, but was quietly cancelled. Instead, Hudson released an SNES game in 1993 simply called \"Inspector Gadget\". The game features a rare glimpse of Dr. Claw's face.\n\nYears later, Ubisoft released \"\" for the PlayStation and \"\", for the Game Boy Color. DreamCatcher Interactive and Magic Pockets released another game, \"\" for Game Boy Advance.\n\nLight and Shadow Productions also released \"\" for the PlayStation 2 and \"Inspector Gadget Racers\", a racing game for the Game Boy Advance.\n\n\"Gadget and the Gadgetinis\" was the first game based on one of the animated spin-offs and was released for the PlayStation 2 and PC in Europe.\n\n\"Inspector Gadget's MAD Dash\" was released for iOS devices, iPhone and iPod Touch, by XMG Studio in 2010. It features Shuki Levy's original theme music and also includes original voices from the show. In the same game, Doctor Claw reveals his face and is once again given the first name George.\n\nSeveral early rap records sampling the \"Inspector Gadget\" theme song were released in 1985. The Kartoon Krew also released \"Inspector Gadget\" on ZYX Music, which contains vocal samples and quotes from the popular cartoon series reenacted by the Rap Group for the song. Brownsville rap group Bad Boys & K-Love released a record on Starlite Records called \"Bad Boys\" that was featured on the UK hip hop compilation \"Street Sounds Electro 9\". Following the trend, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh used samples from the \"Inspector Gadget\" theme song on their single \"The Show\". The theme song has been heavily sampled in the years since then.\n\nA new \"Inspector Gadget\" comic book, based on the original 1983 TV series, was launched in the U.S. by Viper Comics in 2011. A preview issue was published as part of the Free Comic Book Day on May 7, 2011; the entire story was then released officially in August as a 48-page comic book titled \"Inspector Gadget: Gadget on the Orient Express\". The comic book was written by Dale Mettam and illustrated by José Cobá. No follow-up issues have been released to date.\n\nOn a 1989 episode of \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!\", another DiC production, a live action bumper segment titled \"Defective Gadgetry\" had a guest appearance by Inspector Gadget, in which he came to the Mario Bros. for help in repairing him. This was his first live-action appearance predating the 1999 live-action film ten years later. Maurice LaMarche (who would assume the voice role in \"Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets\" ten years later) plays Gadget in this segment. A second live-action segment, \"Treasure of the Sierra Brooklyn\" had Gadget returning to help the Mario Bros. find a lost treasure.\n\nThe \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Adoption's an Option\" featured a sketch featuring the \"Inspector Gadget\" characters in a parody of \"The Terminator\". In this sketch, Gadget replaces a faulty part with a Cyberdyne part, only to be turned into an unstoppable killing machine when Skynet goes online. The sketch goes on to revolve around Penny and Brain trying to avoid being killed by the now-evil Gadget, eventually killing him in a factory. Meanwhile, Mad Cat dies of leukemia; at the end of the show, Dr. Claw blames Gadget for Mad Cat's death. Ironically, Dr. Claw claims that he somehow found out it was Penny and Brain who were behind all of Gadget's successful missions, and planned to gain control of Inspector Gadget via Skynet, and use him to kill them using the Cyberdyne technology that gained control of him. (Penny is voiced by Cree Summer and Brain & Dr. Claw by Frank Welker, who were the original voice actors for the characters).\n\n"}
{"id": "3681919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3681919", "title": "Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl", "text": "Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl\n\nA single light novel written by Mako Komao and illustrated by the manga's artist was published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Bunko imprint in January 2006. The manga series was adapted into a twelve-episode anime television series plus a single original video animation (OVA) sequel by Studio Hibari. The anime aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between January and March 2006; the OVA was released in October 2006. A visual novel was created based on the series for the PlayStation 2 and was released in March 2006. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the five volumes between December 2006 and March 2008. Media Blasters licensed the anime series, including the OVA, and released three DVD volumes between June and October 2007 with English-subtitles. Media Blasters re-released the anime with an English dub.\n\nThe manga has been given positive reviews by the popular anime and manga magazine \"Newtype USA\", and at the online resources Anime News Network and IGN. The first manga volume was \"Newtype USA's Book of the Month\" for December 2006, and \"Newtype\"'s noted Seven Seas Entertainment's \"fan-focused\" translation without an effort to localize the humor for the mainstream American market. In July 2007, \"Kashimashi\" was Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling title. The anime has been likened to Rumiko Takahashi's \"Ranma ½\", though only as far as the mutual transgender themes. Critics of the anime praised the down to earth characters, and the generally great animation quality with its soft and detailed art style.\n\nAt the start of \"Kashimashi\", a young high school boy named declares his love to classmate and close friend , but she quickly rejects him. Dejected, Hazumu climbs Mt. Kashima and is killed when an alien spacecraft accidentally crash lands on him. To rectify this, the alien in the ship named brings Hazumu back to life, but inadvertently regenerates him as a female right down to the DNA level. This change in Hazumu serves as the catalyst for the development of character interactions for the remainder of the series.\n\nAfter Hazumu returns to school, Yasuna unexpectedly professes her love for Hazumu, but this serves only to confuse Hazumu as she adjusts to her new life as a girl. Yasuna, a rather feminine girl, has a unique affliction which makes her incapable of seeing males, and instead sees males as covered in a gray, hazy blur. Hazumu's childhood friend , an athletic girl and tomboy, finds Hazumu's change difficult to cope with. Tomari starts to realize her own romantic feelings for Hazumu as Yasuna starts becoming closer to Hazumu, especially after Tomari witnesses Hazumu and Yasuna kissing one day after school. A conflict arises between Yasuna and Tomari who fight for Hazumu's affection while she is unable to choose between them. This results in a love triangle emerging between the three female main characters. Hazumu's best male friend also starts having romantic feelings for Hazumu, but tries his best to repress them. Tomari's good friend , an intelligent girl interested in the sciences, continuously observes the ongoing development of the love triangle while keeping a stance of watching from afar.\n\nThe very stoic Hitoshi originally came to Earth in order to study human emotions, especially those related to love, in an attempt to save his species from extinction. His species has long-since given up their emotions resulting in a loss of their sexual urges and thus a continuously dwindling population. Hitoshi moves into Hazumu's home where he is warmly welcomed by . He brings with him an artificially intelligent gynoid named which serves as the automatic pilot for his spaceship. Jan Pu's body is modeled after Hazumu's own female body, and possesses an energetic and childish personality.\n\nWhile initially citing Hazumu's change as an accident, Hitoshi later realizes this was an unexpected result of the regeneration process. By the time Hitoshi becomes aware of his mistake, he tells Hazumu and her friends she has only one month left to live. Hitoshi explains to Hazumu's friends how someone very close to Hazumu has to donate \"life grains\" to Hazumu to sustain her life. While unaware her friends know about her impending death, Hazumu continues to live her life and comes to fully accept her fate. The day Hazumu is appointed to die, she falls off the school's roof and Tomari jumps off the roof in an attempt to save her. While in mid-air, Hitoshi interferes by transferring the necessary \"life grains\" to Hazumu, and both survive the fall. When they later wake up in the infirmary, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari, effectively choosing her over Yasuna.\n\nThe anime ends differently, with no life-threatening situation and Hazumu choosing Yasuna in order to help cure her worsening sight problem as it begins to degrade so she can no longer see girls as well. Afterwards however, Yasuna, who becomes able to see all people again, decides to break up with Hazumu, saying she can stand on her own, and in the follow-up original video animation episode, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari on Christmas and the two get married in a ceremony held by Hitoshi.\n\nWhen it was decided that \"Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl\" would begin serialization in MediaWorks' manga magazine \"Dengeki Daioh\", Satoru Akahori wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers, and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of \"true love\". Akahori noted that up to the creation of \"Kashimashi\", the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of \"ecchi\" content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in \"Kashimashi\". He wondered if the story would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much \"ecchi\" or fan service.\n\nWhen thinking on how to write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought up the idea of changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of \"Kashimashi\". Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.\n\nThe title \"Kashimashi\" loosely translates as \"noisy, boisterous, or clamorous\" and is derived from the Japanese phrase, . The main title was originally romanized as \"Kasimasi\" in accordance with Kunrei-shiki romanization, but this was later changed in the English adaptations to \"Kashimashi\" in accordance with Hepburn romanization.\n\nThe \"Kashimashi\" manga is written by Satoru Akahori and illustrated by Yukimaru Katsura. The original character designs were created by Sukune Inugami and the school uniform was designed by the company Cospa. It was serialized between the July 2004 and May 2007 issues of the monthly manga magazine \"Dengeki Daioh\", sold between May 21, 2004 and March 21, 2007, respectively. Five bound volumes were released in Japan between January 27, 2005 and May 26, 2007 published under MediaWorks' \"Dengeki Comics\" imprint, concluding the series at thirty-five chapters.\n\nThe manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment using the revised Hepburn romanization of the title, \"Kashimashi\", unlike the traditional name of \"Kasimasi\". The first volume was released on December 25, 2006, with volumes released every three to four months until the fifth volume was published on March 18, 2008. Seven Seas re-released the manga in a two-volume omnibus collection of roughly 500 pages each; volume one was published in June 2009, followed by volume two in December 2009. The series is also licensed in French by Ki-oon and in Chinese in Taiwan by Kadokawa Media.\n\nThere have been two Internet radio shows for the \"Kashimashi\" series. The first show, entitled , was produced by Beat Net Radio beginning with a pre-broadcast on September 30, 2005, and concluding on October 27, 2006 with fifty-six episodes. As implied in the title, the show was hosted by Kana Ueda, Yui Horie, and Yukari Tamura, who voiced Hazumu, Yasuna, and Tomari in the anime, respectively. Multiple guests appeared on the show such as Yūmao, who sung the anime's ending theme \"Michishirube\", or other voice actors from the anime such as Ryōko Shintani, who voiced Jan Pu, and Daisuke Ono, who voiced Asuta. The radio show's opening theme song was \"Compass: Egao no Yukue\" sung by Ueda, Horie, and Tamura. Listeners could submit contributions to the radio show via a form online. An audio CD containing the episodes between broadcast September 2005 and early 2006 went on sale on May 24, 2006.\n\nThe second Internet radio show, entitled , was also produced by Beat Net Radio, but was only available via podcasts on Bandai Visual Podcast. This show was one of only two radio programs ever distributed on Bandai Visual Podcast. The show was broadcast between December 22, 2005 and April 27, 2006, concluding with ten episodes, and was hosted by Masumi Asano and Ryōko Shintani; Asano voice Ayuki in the anime.\n\nA \"Kashimashi\" light novel, written by Mako Komao and illustrated by Yukimaru Katsura, was published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Bunko imprint on January 10, 2006. The novel is told from a first person perspective alternating between Hazumu, Yasuna, and Tomari between chapters. There is a prologue, four chapters, and an epilogue in the novel; the prologue and the first chapter are told from Hazumu's perspective, then Yasuna's for chapter two, followed by Tomari's for chapter three, and finally back to Hazumu for chapter four and the epilogue. The last three pages of the book contain an afterword written by the author.\n\nA 112-page artbook entitled was released by MediaWorks on March 27, 2006. The book, which is the same size as a manga bound volume, is printed in full-color for the first forty-eight pages which consists of a compilation of promotional art from the separate media types, character profiles with original sketches and comments on the characters, plus interviews from the voice actors of Hazumu, Yasuna, Tomari, Ayuki, and Jan Pu, and lastly original concept drawings of the school uniforms in the series. The middle of the book, which is printed in black-and-white, contains a brief overview of the first twenty-one chapters of the manga, and interviews from the manga author and illustrator, anime director and scenario writer, and the light novel author. There is also a brief explanation of the PlayStation 2 visual novel, of two figurines of Hazumu, and of three audio CDs for the anime version. The last sixteen pages are again in full-color and consist of the anime's first episode in manga format.\n\nThe anime series of \"Kashimashi\" was produced by Studio Hibari, directed by Nobuaki Nakanishi, and written by Jukki Hanada. The series aired on TV Tokyo in Japan from January 11 to March 29, 2006, ending with twelve regular episodes. The episodes were released on seven DVD compilations released between April 26 and October 27, 2006, each containing two episodes. An original video animation (OVA) episode was released with the final DVD which changed the ending from the original television broadcast. There was a small additional portion during the bra shopping scene in episode two that was considered adult enough to be censored out of the television broadcast, but which was included in the DVD release. Bandai Visual released a DVD box set of \"Kashimashi\" in Japan on June 25, 2010.\n\nThe anime series was licensed by Media Blasters in November 2006. The episodes were not dubbed into English, but still included subtitles in English. The first DVD went on sale on June 12, 2007 and contained the first five episodes. Extras on the disc included two ten-minute talks between the voice actresses for the three main female characters, a small collection of Japanese television advertisements, and textless opening videos. The second DVD went on sale on August 21, 2007, and the third and final DVD went on sale on October 23, 2007; the last two DVDs contain four episodes each, including the OVA episode. A box-set containing all three DVDs was released on October 14, 2008. The first episode of the series was included with the June 2007 issue of \"Newtype USA\". A re-release titled \"Kashimashi: Girl Meet Girl Vocal Collection\" was released on April 26, 2011 with an English dub.\n\nThe anime opening theme, \"Koisuru Kokoro\" by Eufonius, and main ending theme, \"Michishirube\" by Yūmao, were both released on January 25, 2006 in Japan by Lantis. The anime used four alternate versions of the ending theme sung by four of the voice actors. In episode eight, it was sung by Masumi Asano, in episode nine by Kana Ueda as Hazumu, in episode ten by Yui Horie as Yasuna, and in episode eleven by Yukari Tamura as Tomari. The opening theme \"Koisuru Kokoro\" was used as the ending theme for the first episode while the song by Yūmao was used as the ending theme in the twelfth episode.\n\nThree insert songs sung by the voice actors were used in three of the episodes. In episode seven, the song \"Hanaemi to Kasumisō\" sung by Ueda was used, while in episode nine the song \"Compass: Egao no Yukue\" sung by Ueda, Horie, and Tamura was used; these two songs were from the \"Compass: Egao no Yukue\" image song single released on December 21, 2005. The last insert song, sung by Tamura, was used in episode twelve and was featured in the image song album \"Norte Amour\" released on April 5, 2006. The album also featured other songs by Ueda, Horie, Tamura, Asano, and Ryōko Shintani, who voiced Jan Pu. The \"Kashimashi Original Soundtrack\" for the anime version was released on April 26, 2006 by Lantis.\n\nFinally, a drama CD based on the anime version was released on May 18, 2006 featuring ten voice actors from the anime. The plot for the drama CD takes place between final aired episode of the anime and the original video animation episode.\n\nA visual novel video game based on the series named was first released on the PlayStation 2 on March 30, 2006 in Japan. The game was developed by Vridge, published by Marvelous Interactive, and released in two editions, limited and regular, on the same day. The limited edition came in a specially made box with an original drama CD called \"Kashimashi Triangle Letter\", and a music CD featuring songs from the game in piano arrange versions. The game was later re-released in a Best Collection edition on November 16, 2006, which sold at less than half the price of the original game. \"Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story\" received a total review score of 26/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 6, 7, and 6) from the Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\".\n\nThe game's story begins on the outset of summer vacation. Hazumu's homeroom teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are the same age as her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort. The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.\n\nThe gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. An important aspect of the game (as in nearly every visual novel) are the \"decision points\" which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options. The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.\n\nIn July 2007, the English version of \"Kashimashi\" was Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling title. The first volume of the manga was given positive reviews from such sources as \"Newtype USA\", a popular anime and manga magazine. The first volume was named as \"Newtype USA\"'s Book of the Month for December 2006, and the review noted Seven Seas Entertainment's \"fan-focused\" translation, which retained the honorifics and much of the Japanese wordplay without efforts to localize the humor for the mainstream American market. The review goes on to state that \"for fans of more mainstream romantic productions, it's a neat twist on the traditional love-triangle formula, and a charming alternative to boys meeting girls.\" In a review at Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos commented that \"the fast-moving events of this first volume combine to form a story of many moods: a gender-bending comedy, but with sci-fi touches, and most of all, a romance more touching than one might expect. The time has come to rethink the love triangle.\" In a review at IGN, A. E. Sparrow stated \"there's plenty to enjoy in the first book, however. Hazumu attempting to buy his first bra is pretty humorous, as are the occasional visits from the aliens who put him in this situation in the first place.\"\n\nThe second volume of the manga was positively reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: \"With its second volume the title pushes fully into the realm of romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back.\" In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, \"The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks [but] ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less.\" In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, \"these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little \"yuri\" series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking.\"\n\nThe first manga volume was generally panned by Deb Aoki at About.com where she felt the characters were \"too flat and uninteresting\", and the story being \"too far-fetched\" and \"ridiculous\" to make a good story. However, Aoki admitted the art is \"quite nice, and there are some moments of genuine tenderness and humor.\" In a review of the first manga volume by Matthew Alexander at Mania.com, he thought that while \"stories with love triangles or gender-switching protagonists have been done before...Hazumu's change into a girl explores romance between people of the same sex in an interesting and comedic way.\"\n\nThe anime series has been compared with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's \"Ranma ½\". In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, \"[the anime is] rather aggravating to watch at times, but seems to have no problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality.\" The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of \"yuri\" anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to \"yuri\". Friedman described the anime's conclusion as \"so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a \"yuri\" ending where the girl remains a girl and get[s] the girl and...thud. Nothing.\" The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.\n\nThe three DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer commented, \"The series' skillful juggling of different characters' viewpoints puts the audience in a position to sympathize strongly with each one. Director Nobuaki Nakanishi guides the emotional content with a light, gentle touch—wisely forgoing extensive internal monologues, speeches, and emotional outbursts. Instead, he draws you in with soft, effortlessly evocative visuals and a simple, beautifully understated score, relying on subtly shifting facial expressions and meaning-laden actions to communicate the quietly affecting emotional states of his characters.\" For the second DVD volume, Theron Martin commented, \"Every element of the production, from the style of the artistry to the palette of colors used to the soundtrack, contributes wonderfully to the look and feel of the original story, and the anime script not only exactly duplicates many scenes from the manga but also does everything in its power to stay true to the spirit of the original writing.\" Finally, for the third volume, Carl Kimlinger wrote \"...the writers make an ill-advised attempt to remove the \"bitter\" from \"bittersweet\" by tacking on some decidedly unconvincing plot developments [in the OVA, although]...it isn't as awful as it could have been. The third volume of \"Kashimashi\"...creat[es] a deeply satisfying conclusion with all of the vicarious emotional thrills you could possibly want.\"\n\nThe three DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as \"something different from the norm\" which \"mixes romance and comedy quite well\". However, the pacing early on is felt as being \"awkward\" which \"takes time to really find its rhythm\". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that \"the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show.\" Beveridge goes on to state \"the mild moments of it are tacky and bad,\" but \"when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable.\" Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that \"despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, \"Kashimashi\" has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented.\" The series is seen to \"close out rather well,\" and \"not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion.\"\n\n"}

As such, metanoia is similar to correction. Metanoia is used in recalling a statement in two ways—-to weaken the prior declaration or to strengthen it.\n\nMetanoia is later personified as a figure accompanying kairos, sometimes as a hag and sometimes as a young lady. Ausonius' epigrams describe her thus: \"I am a goddess to whom even Cicero himself did not give a name. I am the goddess who exacts punishment for what has and has not been done, so that people regret it. Hence my name is Metanoea.\" \n\nThe use of metanoia to weaken a statement is effective because the original statement still stands, along with the qualifying statement. For instance, when one says, \"I will murder you. You shall be punished,\" the force of the original statement (\"I will murder you\") remains, while a more realistic alternative has been put forward (\"you shall be punished\").\n\nWhen it is used to strengthen a statement, metanoia works to ease the reader from a moderate statement to a more radical one, as in this quote from Marcus Aurelius's \"Meditations\"\nI still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing\nthe admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions (Book One);\nHere Aurelius utilizes metanoia to move from a mild idea (\"not observing the admonitions of the gods\") to a more intense one (\"not observing... their direct instructions\"); the clause \"I may almost say\" introduces the metanoia.\n\n"}

{"id": "43121106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43121106", "title": "Motion-capture acting", "text": "Motion-capture acting\n\nMotion-capture acting, also called performance-capture acting, sometimes abbreviated as MoCap or Pcap, is a type of acting in which an actor wears markers or sensors on a skintight bodysuit or directly on the skin. Several cameras from different angles record the actor's movements simultaneously, recording the three-dimensional position of the sensors and not recording the rest of the actor. Sampling is done many times each second, aided by advances in computer technology. The resulting database of 3-D points permits a filmmaker or video game creator to create a digital character and to place this character in an entirely new setting, such as on top of a fictional volcano or flying through the air. This type of acting is seen as a growth area, with predictions that there will be more work in future for actors. Some theatrical agents represent motion-capture actors.\n\nMotion-capture acting can be difficult work. For example, one actor was \"placed in a tiny booth, had dots placed all over his face that captured his movements, and had to sit perfectly still\". One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay, sword fighting, dance, general body movement, running and jumping, gymnastics, and hand-to-hand fighting. It is a new type of acting work. Numerous sources identify actor Andy Serkis as the \"king of motion-capture acting\" based on his work in creating digital characters in movies such as \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"King Kong\" and \"Planet of the Apes\". According to one report, the first use of performance capture acting for a video game was for the 2007 game \"Heavenly Sword\" which starred Serkis and others. Serkis said:\n\nThere have been battles within the film industry about earning recognition for motion-capture actors. The Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers does not consider motion-capture acting as the same type of work as acting, which means that motion-capture actors are often paid less. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) has lobbied the industry for better employment terms and conditions for motion-capture actors, and argued that motion-capture work should be included in standard labor contracts. The industry in 2012 did not give awards for motion-capture acting.\n\n"}

The novel is written as a prologue to the game by Takumi Nakazawa, who has also written scenarios for \"Ever17\", and \"Memories Off 2nd\", and is illustrated by Wadapen. Each chapter centers on one of the six heroines; chapters one through six are arranged as: Nanaka, Aoi, Shuri, Yuzuki, Hinako, and Asami.\n\n\nAn anime adaptation aired in Japan between October 3, 2007 and December 26, 2007 on the TV Kanagawa television network containing thirteen episodes. The series is directed by Yasuhiro Kuroda, and produced by the animation studio Dogakobo through the \"Myself ; Yourself\" Production Committee, which is composed of Happinet Pictures, Marvelous Entertainment, The 5pb, and Pony Canyon Enterprises. Seven DVD compilations, the first six containing two episodes of the anime, and the last containing the final episode have been released; the DVDs are distributed by Happinet Pictures. The anime has been licensed by Maiden Japan.\n\nThe \"Myself ; Yourself\" visual novel, developed by Yeti, was released on December 20, 2007 playable on the PlayStation 2. The game is published by Regista which mainly ports all-age versions of adult games developed by other companies, but in 2006 developed and published their first original game called \"I/O\"; \"Myself ; Yourself\" is the second time Regista has published an original title. Character design for the game is provided by Mutsumi Sasaki, who also did the original character design for \"Memories Off\", \"Chaos;Head\", \"Happy Lesson\", and \"Futakoi\". Unlike most visual novels, \"Myself ; Yourself\" has two male protagonists.\n\nA spin-off sequel to the visual novel entitled was developed by the previous production staff and was released in spring 2009. The game features four new scenarios with Nanaka and Asami getting separate scenarios, and there are two duel scenarios with Shuri and Aoi in one, and Hinako and Yuzuki in the other. Several new characters are also introduced.\n\nThe opening theme for the anime is \"Tears Infection\" by Kaori, and the ending theme is by Kanako Itō; the singles for both songs were released on October 24, 2007. The first opening theme for the visual novel is \"Day-break\" by Kaori, and the second opening theme is \"ivy\" by Kanako Itō. \"Day-break\" was released on the same single album as \"Tears Infection\", and \"ivy\" was released on the same single as \"Kimi to Yozora to Sakamichi to\" as B-side tracks. The visual novel version has seven ending themes: \"Another World\" and \"Myself ; Yourself\" by Ami Koshimizu, by Tomoko Kaneda, \"Never leave me alone\" by Yukari Tamura, by Ayumi Murata, by Megumi Toyoguchi, and by Mai Nakahara. Each of the ending themes are sung by the voice actresses of the six heroines from the series. These songs were released as character song albums: volumes one through three were released on November 21, 2007 and consist of the themes \"Another World\", \"Hajimete no Kiss? (#^.^#)\", and \"Haru no Kiss\" respectively. The second batch, volumes four through six, were released on December 7, 2007 and consisted of the themes \"Never leave me home\", \"Aoitori\", and \"Mirai Kansoku\" respectively. The game's original soundtrack was released with the limited edition release of the game on December 20, 2007; the soundtrack was also used for the anime version.\n\nStig Høgset from THEM Anime Reviews comments that the anime is similar to \"Kanon\" due to both having \"a guy who's not a complete loser, who returns to his old town and meets various people, most of them girls or teachers/parents of said girls.

{"id": "22677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22677", "title": "Oxymoron", "text": "Oxymoron\n\nAn oxymoron (usual plural oxymorons, more rarely oxymora) is a rhetorical device that uses an ostensible self-contradiction to illustrate a rhetorical point or to reveal a paradox.\nA more general meaning of \"contradiction in terms\" (not necessarily for rhetoric effect) is recorded by the \"OED\" for 1902..\n\nThe term is first recorded as latinized Greek ', in Maurus Servius Honoratus (c. AD 400); it is derived from the Greek ' \"sharp, keen, pointed\" and \"dull, stupid, foolish\"; as it were, \"sharp-dull\", \"keenly stupid\", or \"pointedly foolish\". The word \"oxymoron\" is autological, i.e. it is itself an example of an oxymoron. The Greek compound word \"\", which would correspond to the Latin formation, does not seem to appear in any known Ancient Greek works prior to the formation of the Latin term.\n\nOxymorons in the narrow sense are a rhetorical device used deliberately by the speaker, and intended to be understood as such by the listener.\nIn a more extended sense, the term \"oxymoron\" has also been applied to inadvertent or incidental contradictions, as in the case of \"dead metaphors\" (\"barely clothed\" or \"terribly good\"). Lederer (1990), in the spirit of \"recreational linguistics\", goes as far as to construct \"logological oxymorons\" such as reading the word \"nook\" as composed of \"no\" and \"ok\" or the surname \"Noyes\" as composed of \"no\" plus \"yes\", or far-fetched punning such as \"divorce court\", \"U.S. Army Intelligence\" or \"press release\".\nThere are a number of single-word oxymorons built from \"dependent morphemes\" (i.e. no longer a productive compound in English, but loaned as a compound from a different language), as with \"pre-posterous\" (lit. \"with the hinder part before\", compare \"husteron proteron\", \"upside-down\", \"head over heels\", ass-backwards\" etc.) or \"sopho-more\" (an artificial Greek compound, lit. \"wise-foolish\").\n\nThe most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective–noun combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases.\nOne classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", where Romeo strings together thirteen in a row:\nShakespeare heaps up many more oxymorons in \"Romeo and Juliet\" in particular (\"Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show!\" etc.) and uses them in other plays, e.g. \"I must be cruel only to be kind\" (\"Hamlet\"), \"fearful bravery\" (\"Julius Caesar\"), \"good mischief\" (\"The Tempest\"), and in his sonnets, e.g. \"tender churl\", \"gentle thief\".\nOther examples from English-language literature include:\n\"hateful good\" (Chaucer, translating \"odibile bonum\")\n\"proud humility\" (Spenser),\n\"darkness visible\" (Milton), \n\"beggarly riches\" (John Donne),\n\"damn with faint praise\" (Pope),\n\"expressive silence\" (Thomson, echoing Cicero's ), \n\"melancholy merriment\" (Byron),\n\"faith unfaithful\", \"falsely true\" (Tennyson),\n\"conventionally unconventional\", \"tortuous spontaneity\" (Henry James) \n\"delighted sorrow\", \"loyal treachery\", \"scalding coolness\" (Hemingway).\n\nIn literary contexts, the author does not usually signal the use of an oxymoron, but in rhetorical usage, it has become common practice to advertise the use of an oxymoron explicitly to clarify the argument, as in:\nIn this example, \"Epicurean pessimist\" would be recognized as an oxymoron in any case, as the core tenet of Epicureanism is equanimity (which would preclude any sort of pessimist outlook). However, the explicit advertisement of the use of oxymorons opened up a sliding scale of less than obvious construction, ending in the \"opinion oxymorons\" such as \"business ethics\".\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien interpreted his own surname as derived from the Low German equivalent of \"dull-keen\" (High German \"\") which would be a literal equivalent of Greek \"oxy-moron\".\n\n\"Comical oxymoron\" is a term for the claim, for comical effect, that a certain phrase or expression is an oxymoron (called \"opinion oxymorons\" by Lederer (1990)).\nThe humour derives from implying that an assumption (which might otherwise be expected to be controversial or at least non-evident) is so obvious as to be part of the lexicon. \nAn example of such a \"comical oxymoron\" is \"educational television\": the humour derives entirely from the claim that it is an oxymoron by the implication that \"television\" is so trivial as to be inherently incompatible with \"education\".\nIn a 2009 article called \"Daredevil\", Garry Wills accused William F. Buckley of popularising this trend, based on the success of the latter's claim that \"an intelligent liberal is an oxymoron.\"\n\nExamples popularized by comedian George Carlin in 1975 include \"military intelligence\" (a play on the lexical meanings of the term \"intelligence\", implying that \"military\" inherently excludes the presence of \"intelligence\") and \"business ethics\" (similarly implying that the mutual exclusion of the two terms is evident or commonly understood rather than the partisan anti-corporate position).\n\nSimilarly, the term \"civil war\" is sometimes jokingly referred to as an \"oxymoron\" (punning on the lexical meanings of the word \"civil\").\n\nOther examples include \"healthful Mexican food\" (1989), \"affordable caviar\" (1993), and \"Microsoft Works\" (2000).\n\nListing of antonyms, such as \"good and evil\", \"male and female\", \"great and small\", etc., does not create oxymorons, as it is not implied that any given object has the two opposing properties simultaneously.\nIn some languages, it is not necessary to place a conjunction like \"and\" between the two antonyms; such compounds (not necessarily of antonyms) are known as dvandvas (a term taken from Sanskrit grammar). \nFor example, in Chinese, compounds like 男女 (man and woman, male and female, gender), 阴阳 (yin and yang), 善恶 (good and evil, morality) are used to indicate couples, ranges, or the trait that these are extremes of.\nThe Italian \"pianoforte\" or \"fortepiano\" is an example from a Western language; the term is short for \"gravicembalo col piano e forte\", as it were \"harpiscord with a range of different volumes\", implying that it is possible to play both soft and loud (as well as intermediate) notes, not that the sound produced is somehow simultaneously \"soft and loud\".\n\n\n\n"}

The main text of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which is known as the paratext. These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. Paratext is most often associated with books, as they typically include a cover (with associated cover art), title, front matter (dedication, opening information, foreword), back matter (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of paratext, such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding paratext is the case of the 2009 young adult novel \"Liar\", which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.\n\nThe concept of paratext is closely related to the concept of hypotext, which is the earlier text that serves as a source for the current text.\n\nLiterary theorist Gérard Genette defines paratext as those things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, preface or introduction, or illustrations.\nGenette states \"More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold.\" It is \"a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it\". Then quoting Philippe Lejeune, Genette further describes paratext as \"a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text\". This threshold consists of a peritext, consisting of elements such as titles, chapter titles, prefaces and notes. It also includes an epitext, which consists of elements such as interviews, publicity announcements, reviews by and addresses to critics, private letters and other authorial and editorial discussions – 'outside' of the text in question. The paratext is the sum of the peritext and epitext.\n\n\n"}

It is more intimate than stage magic because it doesn't require expensive, large-scale stage equipment and can thus be performed closer to the audience and without a stage. Many of the tricks performed by platform magicians are sufficiently angle-sensitive as to make them impossible to perform as micromagic. Most working magicians are parlor/platform magicians.\n\nMany magicians consider the term \"parlor\" to be old-fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians\" by T.A. Waters, \"The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance.\"\n\nParlor, or club, magicians generally work without assistants and within a few miles of their homes (unlike stage magicians, who may have several in their crew – both backstage and on stage – and may travel thousands of miles between jobs). This is because payment is less for parlor magicians (but still generally more than for close-up performers). Performances of this category of magic include civic and fraternal organizations, business groups, private parties, youth groups, church societies, public dinners, and similar venues.\n\nCommon platform magic tricks include the \"Miser's Dream\" (where a seemingly endless supply of coins is produced from thin air), sucker tricks (like the \"die box\", where a giant die is put in a two-compartment box; the magician makes it vanish but the audience believe he simply shifts it to the other compartment; eventually the magician opens both sides of the box and the die is gone; it has appeared in a previously-empty hat); audience participation tricks (like the breakaway wand, where a wand remains rigid for the magician but falls apart every time the volunteer touches it); production effects (like the square circle, in which a bottomless, topless box with a screened front encloses a bottomless, topless cylinder. Both are shown empty and put together again; the magician then produces large quantities of silk scarves, fruit, bottles, and so on from the \"empty\" cylinder, inside the square box); and so on. There are countless effects that could be considered as fitting into this classification.\n\nPlatform magicians are not as well known to the general public as stage magicians such as David Copperfield and Lance Burton.

The concept was introduced by Mikhail Bakhtin, using a metaphor based on the musical term polyphony.\n\nBakhtin's primary example of polyphony was Fyodor Dostoevsky's prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or describe situations with a 'monological' authorial voice. Instead, he aimed for fully dramatic novels of ideas in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly. According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels is \"a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices\". His major characters are, \"by the very nature of his creative design, \"not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.\"\" (italics in the original)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25084", "title": "Public speaking", "text": "Public speaking\n\nPublic speaking (also called oratory or oration) is the process or act of performing a good speech to a live audience. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners. Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. \n\nThere are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in Lasswell's model of communication: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question \"\"who\" says \"what\" in which \"channel\" to \"whom\" with what \"effect\"?\"\n\nPublic speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a discourse community, in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.\n\nPublic speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a speakers bureau, or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.\n\nAlthough there is evidence of public speech training in ancient Egypt, the first known piece on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. Aristotle was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a liberal arts education during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The classical antiquity works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.\n\nIn classical Greece and Rome, rhetoric was the main component of composition and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any citizen who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called Sophists who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.\n\nSeparately from the Sophists, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, The Academy and The Lyceum, respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.\n\nIn the political rise of the Roman Republic, Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises (progymnasmata), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both forensic and deliberative genres.\n\nThe Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by Cicero and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of humanistic study in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the appeal to the listener's emotions, and the use of digressions. Oratory in the Roman empire, though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.\n\nThe Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After World War II, however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the scientific method and the emphasis on a \"plain\" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.\n\nDespite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied \"years\" after their delivery. Among these examples are Pericles' Funeral Oration in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the Peloponnesian War; Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in \"Ain't I a Woman?”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.\n\nIn addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. Lecterns hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a public address system or a microphone and loudspeaker when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use audience response systems, allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.\n\nTelecommunication and videoconferencing are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of Stanford University wrote in his 1997 article \"Videoconferencing over the Internet\": \"Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone communication systems.\" This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "188949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188949", "title": "Quest", "text": "Quest\n\nA quest is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical. Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation and ethnic culture. In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character). The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.\n\nThe hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home. The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.\n\nSometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir Galahad's quest for the Holy Grail is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: Aeneas quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of Virgil's \"Aeneid,\" and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).\n\nIf the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face false heroes who attempt to pass themselves off as him, or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as Joseph Campbell describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, \"The Hero With a Thousand Faces\".\n\nIf someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished. Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of Jason and Perseus, the fairy tales \"The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird\", \"Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What\", and the story of Beren and Lúthien in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"Silmarillion\".\n\nThe quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed MacGuffins. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.\n\nThe quest, in the form of the Hero's Journey, plays a central role in the Monomyth described by Joseph Campbell; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards. Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.\n\nAn early quest story tells the tale of Gilgamesh, who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of Enkidu, including the search for an emerald.\n\nAnother ancient quest tale, Homer's \"Odyssey\", tells of Odysseus, whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before Athena persuades the Olympians to allow him to return home. Recovering the Golden Fleece is the object of the travels of Jason and the Argonauts in the \"Argonautica\". Psyche, having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by Venus, including a descent into the underworld.\n\nMany fairy tales depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:\n\n\nOther characters may set out with no more definite aim than to \"seek their fortune\", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest. Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.\n\nMany medieval romances sent knights out on quests. The term \"Knight-errant\" sprang from this, as \"errant\" meant \"roving\" or \"wandering\". Sir Thomas Malory included many in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the Holy Grail in Arthurian legend. This story cycle recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like Percival (in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival) or Sir Galahad (in the Queste del Saint Graal), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir Lancelot. This often sent them into a bewildering forest. Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity. The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the Holy Grail—by hermits acting as wise old men -- or women. Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, \"which quickens with life and greenness like the forest.\"\n\nSo consistently did knights quest that Miguel de Cervantes set his Don Quixote on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.\n\nQuests continued in modern literature. Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires, but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common. Quests often appear in fantasy literature, as in Rasselas by Samuel Johnson, or \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively. Quests, also, play a major role in Rick Riordan's fantasy books, among them \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\", \"The Heroes of Olympus\", and \"The Kane Chronicles\".\n\nA familiar modern literary quest is Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the One Ring in \"The Lord of the Rings\". The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; J. R. R. Tolkien uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of friendship and the inner struggle with temptation, against a background of epic and supernatural warfare.\n\n\"The Catcher in the Rye\" is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.\n\nSome writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest. These items are known as MacGuffins, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term. Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a prophecy that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.\n\n"}

It was the first attempt to bring roller derby to TV since RollerGames.\n\n\"RollerJam\" was derived from the original roller derby, but newer skaters used inline skates to modernize the sport (several skaters, mostly older ones, used the traditional quad skates). The program was taped at Universal Studios Stage 21 in Orlando, Florida, known as \"RollerJam Arena\" and now the Impact Wrestling Zone, for the first and second seasons (1999 and 2000) and the former \"American Gladiators\" arena in the show's final season. The first few weeks of the show's second season, which ran from August to October 1999, were taped at the MGM Grand Las Vegas.\n\n\"RollerJam\" was the brainchild of Knoxville, Tennessee-based television impresarios Ross K. Bagwell, Sr. and Stephen Land. Land, a fan of roller derby in boyhood, was inspired to bring the sport back to television by an obituary for roller derby legend Joan Weston that he had read in the \"New York Times\" in May 1997, and shared his idea with Bagwell, his mentor, who gave him a positive response. Between January 1999 and January 2001, Bagwell and Land, under the name Pageboy Entertainment, collaborated with CBS to stage this new televised revival of roller derby.\n\nIn May 1998, Bagwell and Land pitched their idea to The Nashville Network (TNN). The network agreed to air the show but wanted it ready by the new year, forcing Bagwell and Land to create a league, recruit skaters, build a track, design logos and uniforms, hire a television crew, and record the program all in a span of about seven months. In an attempt to build continuity between \"RollerJam\" and previous roller derby incarnations, Bagwell and Land hired Jerry Seltzer, the son of roller derby creator Leo Seltzer, to be commissioner of their new league. The first episode of the show was taped in November 1998, a week after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"RollerJam\" featured several teams of skaters competing in the fictional World Skating League (WSL). Jerry Seltzer served as on-screen WSL commissioner, although he only made a few appearances. The initial teams, each consisting of seven men and seven women, were the New York Enforcers, California Quakes, Florida Sundogs, Nevada Hot Dice, Texas Rustlers, and Illinois Riot (the original names of the latter three teams were the Las Vegas High Rollers, Texas Twisters, and Illinois Inferno; their names were changed prior to the start of the first season). Two notable veterans from Roller Games, \"Rockin'\" Ray Robles and \"Latin Spitfire\" Patsy Delgato, were featured in the second season of \"RollerJam\". Despite strong funding and four seasons of broadcasts on TNN, the venture never became a \"live\" attraction. Fabricated storylines and characters in the mode of professional wrestling were being featured more than actual competitive skating around season 3 and 4, raising the ire of many skaters and fans of true roller derby.\n\nGames were played in four 6-minute periods with as many 60-second jams as possible; women skated odd numbered periods, and the men skated the even-numbered periods. (In traditional roller derby, the game has eight 12-minute periods, again with 60-second jams.) Jams began and ended on the referee's whistle, and a buzzer sounded to reinforce this.\n\nWhereas traditional derby employs a pivot skater, RollerJam did not use one. Instead, each team had 3 blockers, each wearing a white helmet, and two jammers, each wearing a black helmet with red stripes. In-line skates were legalized in attempt to modernize the sport, but certain skaters opted still to use the quad skates.\n\nIn seasons 1-2, the game was played like traditional derby in that the first jam began from the black start/finish line, while the skaters had to continuously skate until a time-out was called or the period ended. In seasons 3-4, this changed to every single jam starting from a standstill start from the black line. In either case, jammers had to start from the back of the pack (the whole group) and work their way through, with the first jammer to break out winning the status of lead jammer. The skaters then got one point for every opponent they successfully lapped. The lead jammer could cut off the jam early by placing their hands on their hips.\n\nThe last jam of the last period always went the full minute regardless of what the period clock showed.\n\nAt the referee's discretion, skaters would sit in a penalty box for violating the rules for various reasons, from 1-2 jams, or face immediate disqualification (ejection) from the game. Skaters frequently racked up these penalties and were willing to take it if they felt it would bring them a moral victory.\n\nThe team with the most points won the game. If the game was tied in regulation, originally the genders would continue to alternate in sudden death overtime periods until there was a clear winner but instead one skater from each team face-off in a Tiebreaker Match Race, 5 laps around the track and whoever crosses the finish line first wins the game for their team.\n\nIn addition, special features would occasionally pop up:\n\nAnother unique concept was that Rollerjam held special games, races and competitions in certain episodes, such as:\n\nThree of the most notable actors featured in \"RollerJam\" were veteran movie actor Tom Nowicki (who played WSL general manager Kenneth Loge III and Sundogs manager Leonard Loge III), Cindy Maranne (who played Amanda Hertz, the manager of the Nevada Hot Dice), former ESPN and current CBS Sports Network play-by-play commentator James Bates (who played \"The Prophet\", a character in Season 4 only who would interrupt games to make speeches, and later managed the Sundogs), and stage actress and former Mouseketeer Lindsey Alley (who played Lisa Seltzer, the \"granddaughter\" of Leo Seltzer). Other characters included Julie Amazon (a bodybuilding skater in Season 4), Canine and Disable (minions of The Prophet who skated for the Sundogs, and \"captured\" Lindsay Francis during the first game of Season 4),Devo (a convict character who skated for the Hot Dice), Lil Nasty (A midget who is a sidekick to Tim Washington) and El Numero (A masked luchador Who skated for the Enforcers).\n\nThe most points ever scored in one jam was 28 in Period 3 of a game between the New York Enforcers and the Illinois Riot. The Riot came back from a 20+ point deficit to win 46-43 in the highest scoring game in RollerJam history. Roller Derby legend Ann Calvello, best known for her brutal feuds with Joan Weston, skated a match race with Kenneth Loge III in \"RollerJam\"'s finale. She emerged victorious.\n\nRon Buffone, a producer for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), called \"RollerJam\" \"That stupid roller blading show\". Buffone believed that TNN treated \"ECW on TNN\", which aired prior to \"RollerJam\" on Friday nights, as a lead-in for \"RollerJam\" rather than a show in its own right, despite the fact that the ECW broadcast generated the network's highest ratings. Nevertheless, some cross-promotion between the two programs did occur, notably when ECW wrestlers such as Axl Rotten and Tommy Dreamer appeared on \"RollerJam\" as \"enforcers\" for the Florida Sundogs against the New York Enforcers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA game based on the show was developed by BLAM! and published by Electronic Arts for the playstation The Rollerjam game made an appearance as an IGN preview. according to Neoseekers, the RollerJam video game was set for a release in the 2nd quarter of 2002, but contrary to IGN release date, as the game was supposed to be released on 2001. But no other trace of information came through about the game being released or canceled without a confirmation.\n\nThe video game itself became featured in Rollerjam as a feud, where the game was announced by EA's Steve Sims, around the halftime of the Nevada Hot Dice Vs. New York Enforcers game on March 21, 2000, during Rollerjams 3rd season \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31186643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31186643", "title": "The Hunger Games", "text": "The Hunger Games\n\nThe Hunger Games is a trilogy of young adult dystopian novels written by American novelist Suzanne Collins. The series is set in \"The Hunger Games\" universe, and follows young characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark.\n\nThe novels in the trilogy are titled \"The Hunger Games\" (2008), \"Catching Fire\" (2009), and \"Mockingjay\" (2010). The novels have all been developed into films starring Jennifer Lawrence, with the film adaptation of \"Mockingjay\" split into two parts. The first two books in the series were both \"New York Times\" best sellers, and \"Mockingjay\" topped all US bestseller lists upon its release. By the time the film adaptation of \"The Hunger Games\" was released in 2012, the publisher had reported over 26 million \"Hunger Games\" trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" universe is a dystopia set in Panem, a country consisting of the wealthy Capitol and 12 districts in varying states of poverty. Every year, children from the districts are selected to participate in a compulsory televised battle royale death match called The Hunger Games.\n\nThe novels were all well received. In August 2012, the series ranked second, exceeded only by the \"Harry Potter\" series in NPR's poll of the top 100 teen novels, which asked voters to choose their favorite young adult books. On August 17, 2012, Amazon announced \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy as its top seller, surpassing the record previously held by the \"Harry Potter\" series. , the trilogy has sold more than 65 million copies in the U.S. alone (more than 28 million copies of \"The Hunger Games\", more than 19 million copies of \"Catching Fire\", and more than 18 million copies of \"Mockingjay\"). \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy has been sold into 56 territories in 51 languages to date.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" trilogy takes place in an unspecified future time, in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, located in North America. The country consists of a wealthy Capitol city, located in the Rocky Mountains, surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is lavishly rich and technologically advanced, but the districts are in varying states of poverty. The trilogy's narrator and protagonist Katniss Everdeen, lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem, located in Appalachia, where people regularly die of starvation. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the \"Dark Days\"), in which District 13 was supposedly destroyed, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining districts, between the ages of 12 and 18, are selected by lottery to compete in an annual pageant called the Hunger Games. The Games are a televised event in which the participants, called \"tributes\", are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The winning tribute and his/her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies, and riches. The purposes of the Hunger Games are to provide entertainment for the Capitol and to remind the districts of the Capitol's power and lack of remorse,\nforgetfulness, and forgiveness for the failed rebellion of the current competitors' ancestors.\n\nEach book in \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy has three sections of nine chapters each. Collins has said this format comes from her playwriting background, which taught her to write in a three-act structure; her previous series, \"The Underland Chronicles\", was written in the same way. She sees each group of nine chapters as a separate part of the story, and comments still call those divisions \"act breaks\".\n\nCollins says she drew inspiration for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of inspiration is the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, in which, as a punishment for past crimes, Minos forces Athens to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast labyrinth. Collins says that even as a child, she was stunned by the idea since \"it was just so cruel\" to force Athens to sacrifice its own children.\n\nCollins also cites as a classical inspiration the Roman gladiator games. She feels three key elements create a good game: an all powerful and ruthless government, people forced to fight to the death, and the game's role as a source of popular entertainment.\n\nA contemporary source of inspiration was Collins' recent fascination with reality television programs. She says they are like \"The Hunger Games\" because the Games are not just entertainment but also a reminder to the districts of their rebellion. On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel-surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the Iraq War. She described how the two combined in an \"unsettling way\" to create her first ideas for the series.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" is the first book in the series and was released on September 14, 2008.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" follows 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her younger sister Primrose Everdeen. Also selected from District 12 is Peeta Mellark. They are mentored by their district's only living victor, Haymitch Abernathy, who won 24 years earlier and has since led a solitary life of alcoholism.\n\nPeeta confesses his longtime secret love for Katniss in a televised interview prior to the Games. This revelation stuns Katniss, who harbors feelings for Gale Hawthorne, her friend and hunting partner. Haymitch advises her to feign feelings for Peeta in order to gain wealthy sponsors who can provide crucial supplies to the \"star-crossed lovers\" during the Games.\n\nIn the arena, Katniss allies with Rue, a young tribute from District 11 who reminds Katniss of her kid sister. When Rue is killed, Katniss places flowers around her body as an act of defiance toward the Capitol. Then the remaining tributes are alerted to a rule change that allows tributes from the same district to win as a team. Katniss finds a seriously wounded Peeta and nurses him back to health. When all of the other tributes are dead, the rule change is abruptly revoked. With neither willing to kill the other, Katniss comes up with a solution: a double suicide by eating poisonous berries. This forces the authorities to concede just in time to save their lives. During and after the Games, Katniss develops genuine feelings for Peeta and struggles to reconcile them with what she feels for Gale.\n\nHaymitch warns her that the danger is far from over. The authorities are furious at being made fools of, and the only way to try to allay their anger is to pretend that her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception.\n\n\"Catching Fire\" is the second installment in the series, released on September 1, 2009.\n\nIn \"Catching Fire\", which begins six months after the conclusion of \"The Hunger Games\", Katniss learns that her defiance in the previous novel has started a chain reaction that has inspired rebellion in the districts. President Snow threatens to harm Katniss' family and friends if she does not help to defuse the unrest in the districts and marry Peeta. Meanwhile, Peeta has become aware of Katniss' disingenuous love for him, but he has also been informed of Snow's threats, so he promises to help keep up the act to spare the citizens of District 12. Katniss and Peeta tour the districts as victors and plan a public wedding. While they follow Snow's orders and keep up the ruse, Katniss inadvertently fuels the rebellion, and the mockingjay pin she wears becomes its symbol. District by district, the citizens of Panem begin to stage uprisings against the Capitol. Snow announces a special 75th edition of the Hunger Games—known as the Quarter Quell—in which Katniss and Peeta are forced to compete with other past victors, effectively canceling the wedding. At Haymitch's urging, the pair teams up with several other tributes, and manages to destroy the arena and escape the Games. Katniss is rescued by the rebel forces from District 13, and Gale informs her that the Capitol has destroyed District 12, and captured both Peeta and their District 7 ally, Johanna Mason. Katniss ultimately learns—to her surprise—that she had inadvertently been an integral part of the rebellion all along; her rescue had been jointly planned by Haymitch, Plutarch Heavensbee, and Finnick Odair, among others. After some hesitation Katniss joins the rebels.\n\n\"Mockingjay\", the third and final book in \"The Hunger Games\" series, was released on August 24, 2010.\n\nMost of the districts have rebelled against the Capitol, led by District 13 and its President Alma Coin. The Capitol lied about the district being destroyed in the Dark Days. After a Mexican standoff with the Capitol, the District 13 residents took to living underground and rebuilding their strength. The District 12 survivors find shelter with them. Katniss, after seeing first-hand the destruction wrought on her district, agrees to become the \"Mockingjay\", the symbol of the rebellion. She sets conditions, however. Peeta, Johanna Mason, Annie Cresta, and Enobaria, fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. Katniss also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor.\n\nFor her sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, Johanna and Annie. However, Peeta has been brainwashed to kill Katniss, and he tries to choke her to death upon their reunion. He undergoes experimental treatment to try to cure him.\n\nAfter she recovers, Katniss and a team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta, Finnick, a camera crew, and various other soldiers, are assigned to film propaganda in relatively quiet combat zones. Katniss, however, decides to go to the Capitol to kill Snow, pretending that Coin gave her that mission. Most of the squad are killed along the way, including recently married Finnick. As Katniss approaches Snow's mansion, she sees a group of Capitol children surrounding it as human shields. Suddenly a hovercraft drops silver parachutes on the children, who reach for them, hoping they bear food. Some of the parachutes explode, creating carnage. The advancing rebels send in medics, including Prim. Then the rest of the parachutes blow up, killing Prim, just as she spots her sister.\n\nLater, Katniss, also injured, awakens from a coma to learn that the rebels have won, and Snow is awaiting execution at her hands. When she meets Snow by chance, he claims that it was Coin who secretly ordered the bombings in order to strip away the support of his remaining followers. Coin then asks the surviving victors to vote on a final Hunger Games, involving the children of high-ranking Capitol officials (including Snow's granddaughter). Katniss and Haymitch cast the deciding votes in favor of the scheme. However, at what is supposed to be Snow's execution, Katniss instead kills Coin with her bow. Snow laughs, then dies.\n\nKatniss is tried, but the jury believes she was mentally unfit, and she is sent home to District 12. Both Katniss' mother and Gale take jobs in other districts. Peeta regains his sanity. Katniss settles down with him, and after many years of persuasion by him, she finally agrees to have children. They have a girl and then a boy.\n\nAll three books have been favorably received. Praise has focused on the addictive quality, especially of the first book, and the action. John Green of \"The New York Times\" compared \"The Hunger Games\" with Scott Westerfeld's \"The Uglies\" series. \"Catching Fire\" was praised for improving upon the first book. \"Mockingjay\" was praised for its portrayal of violence, world building, and romantic intrigue.\n\nThe series received criticism regarding its reality TV \"death game\" theme being derivative of works such as \"Battle Royale\", \"The Running Man\", \"The Long Walk\", and \"\". The series was also criticized for the romantic plotline: Rollie Welch of Ohio's \"The Plain Dealer\" criticized the characters' lack of resolute behavior, and Jennifer Reese of \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated that there was little distinction between Peeta and Gale and the series lacked the \"erotic energy\" seen in the \"Twilight\" series.\n\nJ.C. Maçek III of \"PopMatters\" stated \"While the film saga does capture the action of \"The Hunger Games\", the novels are most assuredly the heart of the story. They are nothing less than 'The Writer’s Cut' of the films themselves.\"\n\nThe last book, \"Mockingjay\", was criticized by Dan Shade of \"SF Site\", who felt that Katniss is a weaker character than her comrades and less resolute in her journey to the Capitol, and that with respect to her vendetta against President Snow, her actions in the finale are inconsistent with her established character.\n\n\nLionsgate Entertainment acquired worldwide distribution rights to a film adaptation of \"The Hunger Games\", produced by Nina Jacobson's Color Force production company. Collins adapted the novel for film herself, along with director Gary Ross. The cast included Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. The first film began production in Spring 2011, and was released in March 2012. For \"\", Ross was replaced as director by Francis Lawrence; the film was released in November 2013. Lawrence then directed \"Mockingjay\", parts 1 and 2, released in November 2014 and November 2015.\n\nA gesture (a raised up hand with three middle fingers pressed together) used in \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy to express unity with people striving to survive, was used in 2014 by anti-government protestors in Thailand, at least seven of whom were arrested for it.\n\n"}
{"id": "20913771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913771", "title": "Theatre", "text": "Theatre\n\nTheatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \"theatre\" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, \"a place for viewing\"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, \"to see\", \"to watch\", \"to observe\").\n\nModern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general.\n\nModern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information.\n\nThe city-state of Athens is where western theatre originated. It was part of a broader culture of theatricality and performance in classical Greece that included festivals, religious rituals, politics, law, athletics and gymnastics, music, poetry, weddings, funerals, and \"symposia\".\n\nParticipation in the city-state's many festivals—and mandatory attendance at the City Dionysia as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of citizenship. Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the rhetoric of orators evidenced in performances in the law-court or political assembly, both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary. The Greeks also developed the concepts of dramatic criticism and theatre architecture. Actors were either amateur or at best semi-professional. The theatre of ancient Greece consisted of three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play.\n\nThe origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.\n\nAthenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state. Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period.\n\nNo tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was institutionalised in competitions (\"agon\") held as part of festivities celebrating Dionysus (the god of wine and fertility). As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play. The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records (\"didaskaliai\") begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced.\n\nMost Athenian tragedies dramatise events from Greek mythology, though \"The Persians\"—which stages the Persian response to news of their military defeat at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama. When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive. More than 130 years later, the philosopher Aristotle analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of dramatic theory—his \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE).\n\nAthenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods, \"Old Comedy\", \"Middle Comedy\", and \"New Comedy\". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of Menander. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster.\n\nIn addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the Satyr Play. Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well-known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of Satyrs. However, according to Webster, satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature.\n\nWestern theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The Roman historian Livy wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by Etruscan actors. Beacham argues that they had been familiar with \"pre-theatrical practices\" for some time before that recorded contact. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of Plautus's broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of Seneca. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving Roman tragedies, indeed the only plays of any kind from the Roman Empire, are ten dramas- nine of them pallilara- attributed to Lucuis Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero.\n\nThe earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century CE. The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre. The ancient \"Vedas\" (hymns from between 1500 and 1000 BCE that are among the earliest examples of literature in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of dialogue) and the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The \"Mahābhāṣya\" by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama. This treatise on grammar from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.\n\nThe major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is \"A Treatise on Theatre\" (\"Nātyaśāstra\"), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The \"Treatise\" is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre. In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.\n\nUnder the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (\"sutradhara\"), who may also have acted. This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a puppeteer—the literal meaning of \"sutradhara\" is \"holder of the strings or threads\". The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique. There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the \"Treatise\" gives most attention to acting (\"abhinaya\"), which consists of two styles: realistic (\"lokadharmi\") and conventional (\"natyadharmi\"), though the major focus is on the latter.\n\nIts drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature. It utilised stock characters, such as the hero (\"nayaka\"), heroine (\"nayika\"), or clown (\"vidusaka\"). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. Kālidāsa in the 1st century BCE, is arguably considered to be ancient India's greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the \"Mālavikāgnimitram\" (\"Mālavikā and Agnimitra\"), \"Vikramuurvashiiya\" (\"Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi\"), and \"Abhijñānaśākuntala\" (\"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"). The last was inspired by a story in the \"Mahabharata\" and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into English and German. \"Śakuntalā\" (in English translation) influenced Goethe's \"Faust\" (1808–1832).\n\nThe next great Indian dramatist was Bhavabhuti (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: \"Malati-Madhava\", \"Mahaviracharita\" and \"Uttar Ramacharita\". Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of \"Ramayana\". The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy \"Ratnavali\", \"Priyadarsika\", and the Buddhist drama \"Nagananda\".\n\nThere are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the Shang Dynasty; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.The Tang Dynasty is sometimes known as \"The Age of 1000 Entertainments\". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called \"Children of the Pear Garden.\" During the Dynasty of Empress Ling, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda.\n\nCantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets’ heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey).They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the eleventh century before becoming a tool of the government.\n\nIn the Song Dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan Dynasty into a more sophisticated form known as \"zaju\", with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, one of the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.\n\nXiangsheng is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue.\n\nTheatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including \"commedia dell'arte\" and melodrama. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the Renaissance and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the Industrial Revolution. \n\nTheatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of the Puritan Interregnum. Theatre was seen as something sinful and the Puritans tried very hard to drive it out of their society. This stagnant period ended once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the Restoration. Theatre (among other arts) exploded, with influence from French culture, since Charles had been exiled in France in the years previous to his reign.\n\nOne of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the type of the Elizabethan era, such as the Globe Theatre, round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no \"theatre manners,” the theatre house became transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and stadium seating facing it. Since seating was no longer all the way around the stage, it became prioritized—some seats were obviously better than others. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery.\n\nBecause of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. Jeremy Collier, a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece \"A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage\". The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage affects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today.\n\nThe seventeenth century had also introduced women to the stage, which was considered inappropriate earlier. These women were regarded as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to ideas on individualism that arose in the wake of Renaissance Humanism), but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage, and some said they were unladylike, and looked down on them. Charles II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts. Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists, like women dressing as men, and having narrow escapes from morally sticky situations as forms of comedy.\n\nComedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like Sheridan's \"The School for Scandal\". Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. Molière was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Italian commedia dell'arte and neoclassical French comedy to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies. Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration of the Crown. They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called \"tragédie bourgeoise\", or domestic tragedy—that is, the tragedy of common life—were more popular in England because they appealed more to English sensibilities.\n\nWhile theatre troupes were formerly often travelling, the idea of the national theatre gained support in the 18th century, inspired by Ludvig Holberg. The major promoter of the idea of the national theatre in Germany, and also of the \"Sturm und Drang\" poets, was Abel Seyler, the owner of the Hamburgische Entreprise and the Seyler Theatre Company.\n\nThrough the 19th century, the popular theatrical forms of Romanticism, melodrama, Victorian burlesque and the well-made plays of Scribe and Sardou gave way to the problem plays of Naturalism and Realism; the farces of Feydeau; Wagner's operatic \"Gesamtkunstwerk\"; musical theatre (including Gilbert and Sullivan's operas); F. C. Burnand's, W. S. Gilbert's and Oscar Wilde's drawing-room comedies; Symbolism; proto-Expressionism in the late works of August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen; and Edwardian musical comedy.\n\nThese trends continued through the 20th century in the realism of Stanislavski and Lee Strasberg, the political theatre of Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht, the so-called Theatre of the Absurd of Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco, American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, experimental and postmodern theatre of Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage, the postcolonial theatre of August Wilson or Tomson Highway, and Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed.\n\nThe first form of Indian theatre was the Sanskrit theatre. It began after the development of Greek and Roman theatre and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia. It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written. Japanese forms of Kabuki, Nō, and Kyōgen developed in the 17th century CE. Theatre in the medieval Islamic world included puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as \"ta'ziya\", where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the \"shaheed\" (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Secular plays were known as \"akhraja\", recorded in medieval \"adab\" literature, though they were less common than puppetry and \"ta'ziya\" theatre.\n\nDrama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \"action\", which is derived from the verb δράω, \"dráō\", \"to do\" or \"to act\". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The early modern tragedy \"Hamlet\" (1601) by Shakespeare and the classical Athenian tragedy \"Oedipus Rex\" (c. 429 BCE) by Sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama. A modern example is \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" by Eugene O'Neill (1956).\n\nConsidered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of dramatic theory. The use of \"drama\" in the narrow sense to designate a specific \"type\" of play dates from the 19th century. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is \"neither\" a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's \"Thérèse Raquin\" (1873) or Chekhov's \"Ivanov\" (1887). In Ancient Greece however, the word \"drama\" encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between.\n\nDrama is often combined with music and dance: the drama in opera is generally sung throughout; musicals generally include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). In certain periods of history (the ancient Roman and modern Romantic) some dramas have been written to be read rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.\n\nMusic and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—Athenian tragedy, for example, was a form of dance-drama that employed a chorus whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an \"aulos\"—an instrument comparable to the modern clarinet), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' (monodies). Modern musical theatre is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from comic opera (especially Gilbert and Sullivan), variety, vaudeville, and music hall genres of the late 19th and early 20th century. After the Edwardian musical comedy that began in the 1890s, the Princess Theatre musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of Rodgers and Hammerstein), with \"Oklahoma!\" (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction. Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included \"My Fair Lady\" (1956), \"West Side Story\" (1957), \"The Fantasticks\" (1960), \"Hair\" (1967), \"A Chorus Line\" (1975), \"Les Misérables\" (1980), \"Into the Woods\" (1986), and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1986), as well as more contemporary hits including \"Rent\" (1994), \"The Lion King\" (1997), \"Wicked\" (2003), and \"Hamilton\" (2015).\n\nMusical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale Off-Broadway, in regional theatres, and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, Broadway and West End musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multimillion-dollar budgets.\n\nTheatre productions that use humour as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern farce such as \"Boeing Boeing\" or a classical play such as \"As You Like It\". Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as black comedy. Black Comedy can have several genres like slapstick humour, dark and sarcastic comedy.\n\nAristotle's phrase \"several kinds being found in separate parts of the play\" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the Attic dialect whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the Doric dialect, these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and poetic metres of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical \"drama\".\n\nTragedy refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation. That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity—\"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity,\" as Raymond Williams puts it. From its obscure origins in the theatres of Athens 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Racine, and Schiller, to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of Strindberg, Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering, and Müller's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change. In the wake of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre.\n\nImprovisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner Dario Fo and troupes such as the Upright Citizens Brigade improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. Keith Johnstone and Viola Spolin are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy. Spolin also became interested in how the process of learning improvisation was applicable to the development of human potential. Spolin's son, Paul Sills popularized improvisational theatre as a theatrical art form when he founded. as its first director, the Second City in Chicago.\n\nHaving been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different theories and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on \"artistic\" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The classical Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his seminal treatise, \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since. In it, he offers an account of what he calls \"poetry\" (a term which in Greek literally means \"making\" and in this context includes drama—comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play—as well as lyric poetry, epic poetry, and the dithyramb). He examines its \"first principles\" and identifies its genres and basic elements; his analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion.\n\nAristotle argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) \"mythos\" or \"plot\", \"ethos\" or \"character\", \"dianoia\" or \"thought\", \"lexis\" or \"diction\", \"melos\" or \"song\", and \"opsis\" or \"spectacle\". \"Although Aristotle's \"Poetics\" is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition\", Marvin Carlson explains, \"almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions.\" Important theatre practitioners of the 20th century include Konstantin Stanislavski, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Jacques Copeau, Edward Gordon Craig, Bertolt Brecht, Antonin Artaud, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, Augusto Boal, Eugenio Barba, Dario Fo, Viola Spolin, Keith Johnstone and Robert Wilson (director).\n\nStanislavski treated the theatre as an art-form that is autonomous from literature and one in which the playwright's contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists. His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream western performance training for much of the last century. That many of the precepts of his system of actor training seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success. Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so. Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States. Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American Method, although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and psychophysical approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum.\n\nTheatre presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The production of plays usually involves contributions from a playwright, director, a cast of actors, and a technical production team that includes a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer, sound designer, stage manager, production manager and technical director. Depending on the production, this team may also include a composer, dramaturg, video designer or fight director.\n\nStagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.\n\nIn its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example in modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition. The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.\n\nThere are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways. Theatrical enterprises vary enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from novices and hobbyists (in community theatre) to professionals (in Broadway and similar productions). Theatre can be performed with a shoestring budget or on a grand scale with multimillion-dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include:\n\nWhile most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set \"run\", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, repertory companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The Royal National Theatre in London performs on a repertory system.\n\nRepertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction.\n\nIn order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a theatre venue are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, who do not have their own theatre venue, perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage.\n\nSome performance groups perform in non-theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include street theatre, and site-specific theatre. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.\n\nA touring company is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city.\n\nThere are many theatre unions including: Actors' Equity Association (for actors and stage managers), the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society (SDC), and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.\n\n"}
{"id": "33998230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33998230", "title": "Theatre pedagogy", "text": "Theatre pedagogy\n\nTheatre pedagogy () is an independent discipline combining both theatre and pedagogy. As a field that arose during the 20th century, theatre pedagogy has developed separately from drama education, the distinction being that the drama teacher typically teaches method, theory and/or practice of performance alone, while theatre pedagogy integrates both art and education to develop language and strengthen social awareness. Theatre pedagogy is rooted in drama and stagecraft, yet works to educate people outside the realm of theatre itself.\n\nAs a movement, theatre pedagogy has many founders. In Germany, where it is widely recognized and practiced, Hans-Wolfgang Nickel is cited as a pioneer in theatre pedagogy with the founding of the Berlin Stage Teachers in 1959. Nickel later became a professor of theatre games and educational activities at the Berlin School of Education in 1974.\n\nAnother well known German theatre pedagogue is Hans Martin Ritter who, starting in 1973, ran a series of tests using Bertholt Brecht's model of learning through play. Ritter's aim was to develop an interdisciplinary project method for the school using theater as a form of teaching and learning. These tests led Ritter to co-found a nationwide pilot program in merging the fields of theatre and education.\n\nPerhaps theatre pedagogy's most internationally known theorist and practitioner is Brazilian director/facilitator Augusto Boal, who created Theatre of the Oppressed, now practiced by millions of people in more than 70 nations.\n\nThe primary purpose of theatre pedagogy is to bring about change in understanding the world around us. In achieving this objective, several other skills are taught and learned. These include:\n\n\nTheatre pedagogy enhances these forms of communication to facilitate human interaction, helping participants to learn about themselves, their peers, and their surrounding world. Rooted both in traditional education and amateur theater, the field of theatre pedagogy has grown to span many sectors, including:\n\n\nPractitioners of theatre pedagogy operate with a situation-oriented educational framework, usually using the medium of theatre as a vehicle to achieve an objective. Through this method, theatre pedagogy gives access to participants' own ideas and impulses, expanding the avenues of communication and interaction with the self and one's sociocultural environment. Through the use of gesture, intonation, facial expression, and behavior onstage, participants analyze these performative aspects created by the dramatic tension of everyday life. Through these physical and personality-affected models, real-life situations can more clearly express themselves.\n\nTheatre pedagogy is taught at universities and colleges, though training in the field is not regulated by state guidelines. In Germany one can receive a theatre pedagogy degree both at the undergraduate and graduate level, and many German cities have theatre pedagogy centers that provide less formal and unregulated training. Similar to these are the Centers for Theatre of the Oppressed, such as CTO Rio in Brazil and the Theatre of the Oppressed Laboratory in New York City where people can receive theatre pedagogy training using Augusto Boal and Paulo Freire's methods.\n\nIn the United States, three higher education institutions with strong theatre and drama pedagogy programs are CUNY School of Professional Studies MA in Applied Theatre, New York University Steinhardt's Educational Theatre program, and Emerson College's MA in Theatre Education.\n\n\n\n"}

These works are protected by common law or statuary copyright unless in the public domain.\n\nThese productions generally feature actors, costumes and sets. The history of the theatrical production goes back to ancient Greece.\n\nTheatrical productions vary in many ways. They can be anything from high school as well as college productions, community theatre productions to summer stock and regional theatre productions all the way to Broadway and Kings Road productions. Today's contemporary theatres produce a variety of plays and musicals that attract very different audiences.\n\nIn full theatrical productions there are a great number of people working towards many types of shows. A producer acquires financing, hires staff and oversees everything from the beginning to the end of each show. Theatrical staff is separated by department, which varies from theatre to theatre and production to production depending on needs.\n\nThe production will employ front of house and back of house staff. In addition to performers, stage hands, stage managers, lighting and sound technicians, many theatres will hire ushers, concessions workers, janitorial and security in mounting a theatrical production.\n\nTheatrical productions may also involve other types of performance exhibitions, which include improvisational, skit and parody performances which involve varying levels of involvement from off-camera staff or assistants in order to create the production.\n"}
{"id": "759763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759763", "title": "Tickle Me Elmo", "text": "Tickle Me Elmo\n\nTickle Me Elmo is a children's plush toy from Tyco Preschool, a division of Tyco Toys, of the Muppet character Elmo from the children's television show, Sesame Street. When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, \"Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!\".\n\nThe toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a fad toy. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. \"People\" reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its MSRP, had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.\n\n\"Tickles The Chimp\", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior. In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as \"Tickles The Chimp,\" which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make \"Sesame Street\" plush, but did have \"Looney Tunes\" plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me Tasmanian Devil, they also made Tickle Me versions of baby Bugs Bunny and Tweety, they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do \"Looney Tunes\" but gained the rights to \"Sesame Street,\" thus starting Tickle Me Elmo. The invention was originally introduced under Cabbage Patch at Hasbro Industries.\n\nNeil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, \"When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise.\"\n\nTickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units. The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the day after Thanksgiving, when they suddenly sold out. With the Christmas shopping season approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers. Promotion was helped by Rosie O'Donnell, who had shown the toy on her popular TV show in early October. O'Donnell's \"surprise plug\" created unexpected demand for Elmo, resulting in shortages in the stores that sold it.\n\nThe scarcity of the new toy provoked a \"shopping frenzy\". Two women were arrested in Chicago for fighting over the doll, while in New York some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores. Someone allegedly purchased a Tickle Me Elmo for $7,100 in Denver. A clerk working at a Wal-Mart store in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was among those injured by \"Elmo-mania\". During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, a crowd of 300 stampeded down the aisle after spotting him being handed a box of the toys by another employee. Trampled, he suffered \"a pulled hamstring, injuries to his back, jaw and knee, a broken rib and a concussion\".\n\nBy the end of December, the entire stock of one million \"Tickle Me Elmo\" toys had been sold.\n\nIn early 1997, Tyco released new \"Tickle Me\" toys based on other characters from \"Sesame Street\" – first \"Tickle Me Ernie\" and \"Tickle Me Big Bird\", then \"Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo. With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, \"Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" and \"Mini Tickle Me Ernie\" were also put on the market.\n\nThe \"Surprise Edition\" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the \"Surprise Edition\" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.\n\nIn 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, Fisher-Price released a new Elmo doll called \"TMX\", meaning \"Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten\" or \"Tickle Me eXtreme\". The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention (River Forest, Illinois), was first announced at the American International Toy Fair. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.\n\nThe full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing confidentiality agreements. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of \"Toy Wishes\" magazine said, \"The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.\".\nToy analyst Chris Byrne told \"USA Today\", \"This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category.\" Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. \"The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon.\" He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since Furby in 1998. However, some members of the media expected a large response. Toys \"R\" Us stores and Amazon had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill. As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in Tampa, Florida was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on \"Saturday Night Live\", which said the man \"was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason Bert'\".\n\nTMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 financial year to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of financial analysts. TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.\n\nIn January 2007, Mattel announced it would release \"TMX Friends\", featuring Elmo, Ernie and Cookie Monster.\n\nFor the Christmas 2007 season, Fisher-Price released a version with hidden surprises. Mattel has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.\n\nPlayskool released the toy again as \"LOL Elmo\". Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's Sesame Street section, there is a sign printed \"Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012\". Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.\n\nPlayskool made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like \"Elmo is one ticklish monster\". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1509004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1509004", "title": "Travesti (theatre)", "text": "Travesti (theatre)\n\nTravesti (literally \"disguised\" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an opera, play, or ballet by a performer of the opposite sex. Depending on sources, the term may be given as travesty, travesti, or en travesti. The \"Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English\" explains the origin of the latter term as \"pseudo-French\", although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. \"Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra\" (1876), \"La revue des deux mondes \" (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.\n\nFor social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and \"travesti\" roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the pantomime traditionally contains a role for a \"principal boy\", a breeches role played by a young woman, and also one or more pantomime dames, female comic roles played by men. Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of Victorian burlesque, there were usually one or more breeches roles.\n\nUntil the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the Papal States—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in drag because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.\n\nAs a boy player, Alexander Cooke is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as Agrippina in Ben Jonson's \"Sejanus His Fall\". With the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. Edward Kynaston, whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's \"Epicoene\" and Evadne in Beaumont and Fletcher's \"The Maid's Tragedy\", was one of the last of the era's boy players.\n\nLondon's Shakespeare's Globe theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original Globe Theatre, continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of \"Henry V\" in 1997, while Mark Rylance played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of \"Antony and Cleopatra\".\n\n\"Travesti\" roles for men are still to be found in British pantomime, where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the pantomime dame.\n\nCastrati, adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas – initially in female roles. In the first performance of Monteverdi's \"Orfeo\" in 1607 the roles of Eurydice and Proserpina were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the Papal States, where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.\n\nAn exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits. In Lully's 1686 opera \"Armide\" the hero (Renaud) was sung by a haute-contre (a type of high tenor voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In Rameau's 1733 \"Hippolyte et Aricie\", the hero (Hippolyte) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three Fates and Tisiphone were scored for basses and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's \"Platée\" is also for an haute-contre.\n\nFemale roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's 1890 opera \"Hänsel und Gretel\" was originally written for a mezzo-soprano, but was sung by the tenor Philip Langridge in the Metropolitan Opera's 2009 production directed by Richard Jones. Azio Corghi's 2005 opera \"Il dissoluto assolto\", which incorporates story elements from Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\", casts a counter-tenor in the role of the mannequin of Donna Elvira.\n\nThe portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in Renaissance court ballet and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: \"Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers.\" Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: \"What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?\"\n\nIn the original production of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in 1890, a male dancer, Enrico Cecchetti, created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.\n\nIn Frederick Ashton's 1948 choreography of \"Cinderella\", Robert Helpmann and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. Ben Stevenson later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet. Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in \"La Sylphide\" and the Widow Simone in \"La fille mal gardée\".\n\nWith the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men. Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in \"travesti\" roles were Mary Anne Keeley who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and the robber Jack Sheppard in Buckstone's play based on his life; Maude Adams who played Peter Pan in the American premiere of Barrie's play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times; and Sarah Bernhardt who created the role of Napoleon II of France in Edmond Rostand's \"L'Aiglon\", played Lorenzino de' Medici in Musset's \"Lorenzaccio\", Pelléas in Maeterlinck's \"Pelléas and Mélisande\" and perhaps most famously played the title role in \"Hamlet\". In the Victorian era, musical burlesques generally included several breeches roles. According to the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", although \"an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency.\" One of the specialists in these roles was Nellie Farren who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including \"Robert the Devil\", \"Little Jack Sheppard\" and \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\". In British pantomime, which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or Principal boy is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.\n\nThe practice of women performing \"en travesti\" in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as castrato singers went out of fashion and were replaced by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of Rossini's 1813 \"Tancredi\" was specifically written for a female singer. However, \"travesti\" mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both Handel and Mozart, sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in \"The Marriage of Figaro\". In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was Richard Strauss, who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and the Composer in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\".\n\nFrom 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the \"corps de ballet\" portraying matadors, hussars, and cavaliers, and even as the prima ballerina's 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France. Although both Fanny Elssler and her sister Thérèse danced \"travesti\" roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man. The French ballerina Eugénie Fiocre, who created the role of Franz in \"Coppélia\", was particularly known for her \"travesti\" performances.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

It is a form of parody in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or pastiching text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of burlesque.\n\nLike ballad opera, burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores. Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as extravaganzas. Many of the male roles were played by actresses as breeches roles, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.\n\nOriginally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included J. R. Planché, H. J. Byron, G. R. Sims, F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert and Fred Leslie.\n\nBurlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the Victorian era. The word \"burlesque\" is derived from the Italian \"burla\", which means \"ridicule or mockery\". According to the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", Victorian burlesque was \"related to and in part derived from pantomime and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'.\" Another antecedent was ballad opera, in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.\nMadame Vestris produced burlesques at the Olympic Theatre beginning in 1831 with \"Olympic Revels\" by J. R. Planché. In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, \"Olympic Revels\" opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing whist. In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in \"The Beggar's Opera\". Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed operetta, music hall and revue, and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as extravaganzas. The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.\n\nUnlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience; some writers, such as the Brough brothers, aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and H. J. Byron's success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes. Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" and \"La traviata\" received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly. \"Our Lady of the Cameleon\" by Leicester Silk Buckingham and \"Our Traviata\" by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of \"Il trovatore\", two of them by H. J. Byron: \"Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer\" (1863) and \"Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto\" (1880). The operas of Bellini, Bizet, Donizetti, Gounod, Handel, Meyerbeer, Mozart, Rossini, Wagner and Weber were burlesqued. In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:\n\nBy the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.\n\nW. S. Gilbert wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with \"Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack\" (1866), the most successful of which was \"Robert the Devil\" (1868). In the 1870s, Lydia Thompson's burlesque troupe, with Willie Edouin, became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as H. B. Farnie and Robert Reece, both in Britain and the U.S.\n\nThe Shakespeare scholar Stanley Wells notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era. Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque \"takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play.\" Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella. The witches greet them with \"Hail! hail! hail!\": Macbeth asks Banquo, \"What mean these salutations, noble thane?\" and is told \"These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'\". Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre. An 1859 burlesque of \"Romeo and Juliet\" contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from \"Don Pasquale\", and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including \"Buffalo Gals\", and \"Nix my Dolly\".\nThe dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad puns. For example, in \"Faust up to Date\" (1888), a couplet reads:\n\nAccording to \"Grove\", although \"an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency.\" Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché (\"fanciful and elegant\") and Gilbert (\"witty, never vulgar\"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, \"the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste.\" Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:\n\nThe question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. Aristophanes, Rabelais, Geo Cruikshank, the authors of the \"Rejected Addresses\", John Leech, Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.\nIn his 1859 Longfellow burlesque \"Hi-A-Wa-Tha\", the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by Mrs. John Wood as Minnehaha:\n\nIn a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to \"The Pretty Druidess\":\n\nActresses in burlesque would often play breeches roles, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles. These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.\n\nThe depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture. Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned. Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”\n\nBurlesque became the specialty of London's Royal Strand Theatre and Gaiety Theatre from the 1860s to the early 1890s. In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognize. Nellie Farren starred as the Gaiety Theatre's \"principal boy\" from 1868, and John D'Auban choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891. Edward O'Connor Terry joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included \"Robert the Devil\" (1868, by Gilbert), \"The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole\" (1877), \"Blue Beard\" (1882), \"Ariel\" (1883, by F. C. Burnand) and \"Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed\" (1883).\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer Fred Leslie joined the Gaiety, composers like Meyer Lutz and Osmond Carr contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format. These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie. They often included Leslie's libretti, written under his pseudonym, \"A. C. Torr\", and were usually given an original score by Lutz: \"Little Jack Sheppard\" (1885), \"Monte Cristo Jr.\" (1886), \"Pretty Esmeralda\" (1887), \"Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim\" (1887), \"Mazeppa\" and \"Faust up to Date\" (1888). \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\" (1889) made fun of the play \"Ruy Blas\" by Victor Hugo. The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused. The last Gaiety burlesques were \"Carmen up to Data\" (1890), \"Cinder Ellen up too Late\" (1891), and \"Don Juan\" (1892, with lyrics by Adrian Ross).\n\nIn the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of Edwardian musical comedy. In 1896, Seymour Hicks declared that burlesque \"is dead as a doornail and will never be revived.\" From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.\n\n\n\n"}

It could help bridge the digital divide by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from World Wide Web. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing Web. Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.\n\nWWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.\n\nWWTW is a network of interconnected VoiceSites (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications \"created by\" users themselves and \"hosted\" in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone.\n\nKey enabler technologies include:\n\n1. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator\n\n2. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine\n\n3. HSTP - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol\n\n4. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser\n\nWorld Wide Telecom Web was conceived by Arun Kumar at IBM India Research Lab during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher Nitendra Rajput in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and VoiceXML standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher Dipanjan Chakraborty and colleague Sandeep Jindal & Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. C.K. Prahalad and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and Amit Anil Nanavati got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a Research Report. Soon after Sheetal K. Agarwal joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at World Wide Telecom Web Publications.\nThis included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of Voikiosk system conceived primarily by Nitendra. It is a village portal providing locally relevant content in local language and is available over an ordinary telephone call.\n\n\n\n"}
