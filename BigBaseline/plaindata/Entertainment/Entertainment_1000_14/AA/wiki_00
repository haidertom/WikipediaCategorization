It was created by Glória Perez and directed by Rogério Gomes and Pedro Vasconcellos. It premiered on 3 April 2017, replacing \"A Lei do Amor.\" The show ran for 29 weeks with a total of 172 episodes and ended on 20 October 2017, replaced by \"O Outro Lado do Paraíso.\"\n\nThe telenovela features an ensemble cast of Isis Valverde, Marco Pigossi, Fiuk, Bruna Linzmeyer, Paolla Oliveira, Juliana Paes, Emilio Dantas, Rodrigo Lombardi, Débora Falabella, Dan Stulbach and Maria Fernanda Cândido.\n\nThe show deals with contemporary themes that affect modern Brazilian culture, such as drug trafficking, gambling and transsexuality, and has received positive reception from viewers and critics. The show achieved an average viewership of 36 points in the much-coveted 9 pm time slot.\n\nIn April 2016, Glória Perez announced her next telenovela, due to premiere in the first half of 2017. She also stated that it would be different from the ones she had produced 20 years previously, which had mainly featured different settings and culture-oriented storylines. \"A Força do Querer\" mainly features romance and is primarily shot in Brazil. Originally titled \"À Flor da Pele\" during the early stages of production, it was changed to \"Flor do Querer\" in November 2016 and to the current title in December.\n\nPaolla Oliveira was the first to be cast for the project, and was announced to star in the telenovela in March 2016. Fábio Assunção was originally cast to portray Eugênio but later declined in order to star in an upcoming television series. Dan Stulbach was then cast.\nLeopoldo Pacheco was originally cast as Junqueira but he and Chay Suede preferred \"Novo Mundo\". Suede was the first option to portray Ruy. Daniel Rocha also auditioned for the role of Ruy but Fiuk was preferred over him. Vera Fischer was also cast but due to personal differences with the showrunner, she was replaced by Betty Faria.\n\nThe character of Bibi was inspired by Fabiana Escobar, known as \"queen of pot\". Showrunner Glória Perez initially wanted the character to be the center of a separate miniseries but decided to include it in the telenovela.\n\nSince her role is inspired by a siren, Isis Valverde was prepared for three months in readiness for her role by Mirella Ferraz a professional in that part.\n\nPromising lawyer Caio is considered for administering the Garcia Company, one of the largest in the country. However, when Bibi decides to end their relationship, he leaves everything behind and relocates to the United States. Fifteen years later, Caio returns to Brazil to take up a position in the judiciary and meets once again with Bibi, who failed to complete college and is married to Rubinho. Rubinho goes through a delicate financial condition, as he and Bibi struggle to make ends meet which forces him to enter the world of crime.\n\nRuy is prepared to take over the company of his father Eugênio, as the only qualified heir. Ruy is engaged to Cibele, who gives him professional and personal stability. When he travels to Parazinho, he is enchanted by Ritinha, a young woman who loves the fascination she exerts upon men and seems to believe herself to be a mermaid. She continues a game of seduction with Ruy despite being engaged to Zeca, a truck driver who loves her intensely despite gossip about her activities. On the day of their wedding he learns of Ritinha's fling with Ruy; fearing his temper, Ritinha runs away with Ruy while Zeca angrily leaves Parazinho. In another town, Zeca meets Jeiza, a police officer who dreams of becoming a mixed martial arts fighter.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruy's sister Ivana has been undergoing female to male gender reassignment, causing conflict with their mother, Joyce. Joyce's relationship with Eugênio begins to crumble when he meets Irene, who tries to tempt him away. And Eugênio's older brother Eurico tries to keep everyone under his control though he can't control the gambling addiction of his wife Silvana.\n\nA Força do Querer: Vol. 1 is the first installment of the series of soundtracks of the telenovela.\n\nThe album consist of an original score by Roberto Carlos. \"Sereia\" (released on 5 April 2017) was composed specifically for the show.\n\nThe telenovela had an average daily reach of 45 million viewers (number of people who watch at least one minute of the telenovela every day). The plot also swept across social networks and ranked first on the Social Wit List in April 2017, a ranking that highlights the most-commented releases in Latin America.\n\nOn its premiere, \"A Força do Querer\" registered a viewership rating of 32.9 points, the highest premiere viewership since the 2016 debut of \"Velho Chico\". On its first week of broadcast, it recorded an average of 32 points. It had the second-largest viewership, after \"Amor à Vida\".\n\nThe penultimate episode, that aired on 19 October, recorded 48.8 points of average and peaking at 51 points with a 65% share, hitting the record, according to consolidated data of Ibope in Greater São Paulo. With this indices, \"A Força do Querer\" had the highest audience since the last episode of \"Avenida Brasil\", which recorded 52 points on 19 October 2012.\n\nOn the finale, \"A Força do Querer\" had the largest audience since the end of \"Avenida Brasil\". Having aired from 9:15 pm to 11:32 pm, the final episode had a record-setting 50.1 points and peaked at 53 points. These were the best ratings since the finale of \"Avenida Brasil\", which had 51.7 points on 19 October 2012. In Rio de Janeiro, the last episode recorded 49 points in average (highest final indices since \"Império\", which had 50 points).\n\nCumulatively, the show recorded an average rating of 35.67.\n\nSince its debut, the telenovela received criticism for not using the northeastern accents in the state of Pará and the depiction of the state, such as the existence of an aquarium located in Ver-o-Peso. There were varied opinions among the viewers, especially those from Pará. Rede Globo and show's creator Glória Perez said that the show was not set in the capital of Pará but in the fictional city of Parazinho and that the work of fiction has no commitment to be true to reality.\n\nThe fact that the plot touches on drug trafficking and other crime aroused the idea that the telenovela was unapologetic to such. The show to received a flurry of criticism, mainly by evangelists and conservatives. Pastor and Deputy Marco Feliciano said that, \"Rede Globo offered a course for banditry\". Showrunner Glória Perez responded to the accusations: \n\nBefore the debut of the telenovela, the subject of transexuality was already causing controversy. Catholic organizations asked that Globo not allow this theme in the show. The theme about gender identity, addressed in the plot by the character Ivana was also not accepted by a portion of the audience, among them also evangelists and conservatives. They accused the network of using the telenovela to popularize gender ideology. According to them, the telenovela had a clear intention to show that it is completely normal to identify as one gender even if one is of the other.\n\n"}

{"id": "1937861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937861", "title": "Anagnorisis", "text": "Anagnorisis\n\nAnagnorisis (; ) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the hero's sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy.\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", as part of his discussion of peripeteia, Aristotle defined anagnorisis as \"a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune\" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of catharsis.\nIn the Aristotelian definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in Shakespeare's \"King Lear\") or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero. \n\nAristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when Oedipus killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when Iphigeneia in Tauris realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them. Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.\n\nAnother prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in Aeschylus's \"The Choephoroi\" (\"Libation Bearers\") when Electra recognizes her brother, Orestes, after he has returned to Argos from his exile, at the grave of their father, Agamemnon, who had been murdered at the hands of Clytemnestra, their mother. Electra convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself. The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.\n\nThe section of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies. A standard plot of the New Comedy was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the tricky slave. This plot appears in Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\", where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.\n\nThe earliest use of anagnorisis in a murder mystery was in \"The Three Apples\", a classical \"Arabian Nights\" tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its twist ending. The protagonist of the story, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is ordered by Harun al-Rashid to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.\n\nAnagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary \"auteur\" M. Night Shyamalan uses similar revelations in \"The Sixth Sense\", in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in \"Unbreakable\", in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power. Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that Darth Vader is the father of Luke Skywalker in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book \"Recognitions\".\n\nA humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:\n\nIn any moment of such crisis / \none thinks, of course, of those devices / \nwhich Aristotle said were needed / \nin any poem. We have heeded / \nAristotle, and our plot, / \n(beginning, middle, end), has got / \ncomplications too, and error / \nfit to rouse cathartic terror, / \nprotagonists, antagonists, / \nperipiteia, turns and twists. / \nThe poet's comments form the choruses, / \nbut now it's time for anagnorisis. / \nWhen Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / \nis his own father's lawful wedded / \nwife, in fact she is his mother, / \nor Iphigenia finds her brother, / \nDiscovery or Recognition / \nbrings the plot to its fruition.\n"}

The verse usually maintains its metric integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented (\"dropped line\") to show the unity of the verse line.\n\nThese are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in blank verse:\n\n\"The device originated in classical tragedy as a means of heightening dramatic tension.\" \"It figures in almost all the plays of Sophocles and Euripides. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another.\" In Sophokles’ \"Oedipus\", for example, \"as \"Kreon\" seizes \"Antigone\" (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of \"antilabe\" in which \"Oedipus\", \"Kreon\", and the chorus participate.\" \"In \"Electra\" (1502-3), \"antilabe\" occurs as \"Orestes\" tries to induce \"Aegisthys\" to enter the house so that \"Orestes\" can kill him.\" \"[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides.\" \"In the plays of Aeschylus, with the possible exception of \"Prometheus Bound\" (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur.\" \n\n\"Dialogic exchanges using both \"stichomythia\" and \"antilabe\" are common in Seneca.

{"id": "1130838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130838", "title": "Atellan Farce", "text": "Atellan Farce\n\nThe Atellan Farce (Latin: \"Atellanae Fabulae\" or \"Fabulae Atellanae\", \"favola atellana\"; \"Atellanicum exhodium\", \"Atella comedies\"), also known as the Oscan Games (Latin: \"ludi Osci\", \"Oscan plays\"), were masked improvised farces. It was very popular in Ancient Rome, and usually put on after longer plays like the pantomime. The name is believed to have been derived from Atella, an Oscan town in Campania, who were one of the first to have a theatre and the hypothesized point of origin of Atellan Farce. They were originally written in Oscan and imported into Rome in 391 BC. In later Roman versions, only the ridiculous characters read their lines in Oscan, while the others used Latin.\n\nAtellan Farce evidence is scarce, but surviving fragments point to the comedy genre coming about no earlier than 90 BC. \n\nSome of the hypothesized stock characters included:\nThere has been some debate of these characters connection to similar stock characters in Commedia dell'arte, as well as Punch and Judy. Atellan Farce and Commedia were both improvised masked comedies. Some Historians argue that the stock characters in Atellan Farce are the beginnings of what would become the stock characters of Commedia dell'arte.\n\nSome of the theorized character progressions are as follows:\nHowever, the connection of Atellan Farce to Commedia dell'arte and assumption that Atellan Farce is the precursor to Commedia dell'arte is still under debate. As for Atellan Farce's connection to Punch and Judy, the similarities between Punch and the Commedia dell'arte character Pulcinella are notable. However, many historians still debate whether or not Punch's derivation can be traced back to Pulcinella.\n\nAt first, the subjects were decided upon before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised as it proceeded. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens, who did not lose their rights as citizens, and were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were probably varied by songs in the rude Saturnian metre: the language was that of the common people, accompanied by lively gesticulation and movements. They were characterized by coarseness and obscenity.\n\nLater, it is believed that the dictator Sulla wrote some Atellan Fables. Quintus Novius, who flourished 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote some fifty, including \"Macchus Sexul\" (\"Exiled Macchus\"), \"Gallinaria\" (\"The Henhouse\"), \"Surdus\" (\"The Deaf One\"), \"Vindemiatores\" (\"The Harvesters\"), and \"Parcus\" (“The Treasurer”).\n\nLucius Pomponius, of Bologna, is known to have composed a few, including \"Macchus Miles\" (\"Macchus the Soldier\"), \"Pytho Gorgonius\", \"Pseudoagamemnon\", \"Bucco Adoptatus\", and \"Aeditumus\". He was also said to have been influenced by the Palliata Fabius Dorsennus. Quintus Novius and a \"Memmius\" were also authors of these comedies; Ovid and Pliny the Younger found the work of Memmius to be indecent.\n\nTaken from Tacitus ( Annals, Book 4): \"...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor Tiberius finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players. 'They had often,' he said. 'Sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority'. The players, upon this, were banished from Italy\".\n\nSuetonius (\" Tiberius\", 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying \"the old goat lapping up the doe\" (\"hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire\") became popular.\n\nThe above passage suggests a growth in popularity or maybe even a revival of these farces, in the 20s AD, that met the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators. Perhaps they were even performed out in public places as an act of direct hostility towards (or a means to mock) specific people or families. At any rate, these performances eventually became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all those who performed in these farces were banished from Italy.\n\nThe \"Augustan History\" records that Hadrian furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.\n\n\nThe works of Pomponius and Novius can be found in \n\n"}

{"id": "359443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359443", "title": "Bathos", "text": "Bathos\n\nBathos ( ; ,  \"depth\") is a literary term, coined by Alexander Pope in his 1727 essay \"Peri Bathous\", to describe amusingly failed attempts at sublimity (i.e., pathos). In particular, bathos is associated with anticlimax, an abrupt transition from a lofty style or grand topic to a common or vulgar one. This may be either accidental (through artistic ineptitude) or intentional (for comic effect). Intentional bathos appears in satirical genres such as burlesque and mock epic. \"Bathos\" or \"bathetic\" is also used for similar effects in other branches of the arts, such as musical passages marked \"ridicolosamente\". In film, bathos may appear in a contrast cut intended for comic relief or be produced by an accidental jump cut.\n\nAs the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by Alexander Pope in his essay \"Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\" (1727). On the one hand, Pope's work is a parody in prose of Longinus' \"Peri Hupsous\" (\"On the Sublime\"), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the \"dunces.\"\n\nThe nearest model for Pope's essay is the \"Treatise of the Sublime\" by Boileau of 1712. Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, Leonard Welsted, had issued a \"translation\" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau. Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this \"sublime,\" Pope commented upon and countered their system with his \"Peri Bathos\" in the Swift-Pope-Gay-Arbuthnot \"Miscellanies.\" Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be \"awe-inspiring,\" Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might \"sink\" in poetry, satirizing the very men who were allied with Ambrose Philips. Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's \"Odes,\" and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. Edmund Burke was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756).\n\nOne example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting. In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial genres, still life ranked the lowest. However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word \"stiffen,\" evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this \"low\" genre:\n\nIn chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the tropes and figures of speech.\n\nAlthough Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to \"sink,\" the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things. First, it violates \"decorum,\" or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.\n\nSince Pope's day, the term \"bathos,\" perhaps because of confusion with \"pathos,\" has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so \"pathetic\" as to be humorous.\n\nWhen artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of Surreal humour and the absurd. However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet to be frightening), the result is bathos.\n\nArguably, some forms of kitsch (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of Titian's \"Last Supper\" on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters) express bathos in the concrete arts.\n\nA tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the camp sensibility, as first analyzed by Susan Sontag, in a 1964 essay \"Notes on camp\".\n\nBathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one \"Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:\n\nSeveral decades before Pope coined the term, John Dryden had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his Restoration spectacular, \"Albion and Albanius\" (1684–85):\n\nPope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic \"Rape of the Lock,\" where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover \"or lapdog.\" Søren Kierkegaard, in \"The Sickness Unto Death,\" did the same thing, when he suggested that the \"self\" is easy to lose and that the loss of \"an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife\" would be more grievous. When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of \"undercutting.\" When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.\n\nIn 1764, William Hogarth published his last engraving, \"The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures\", depicting Father Time lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, parodying the fashion at that time for \"sublime\" works of art, and satirising criticisms made of Hogarth's own works. It may also be seen as a \"vanitas\" or \"memento mori\", foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later. Headed \"Tail Piece\", it was intended as the tailpiece for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.\n\nAlfred Lord Tennyson's narrative poem \"Enoch Arden\" ends with the following lines:\n\n<poem>So past the strong heroic soul away.\nAnd when they buried him the little port\nHad seldom seen a costlier funeral.</poem>\n\nAfter stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a pathos-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.\n\nA musical representation is found in composer Igor Stravinsky's 1923 Octet for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.\n\nContemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:\nThe Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest features purple prose, at times exhibiting bathos:\nLegendary darts commentator Sid Waddell was famed for his one-liners, including this example:\n\n"}
{"id": "275510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275510", "title": "Beer pong", "text": "Beer pong\n\nBeer pong, also known as Beirut, is a drinking game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side. Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups. If a ball lands in a cup (known as a 'make'), the contents of that cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent's cups is the winner.\n\nBeer pong is played at parties, bars, colleges/universities and other venues such as tailgating at sporting events.\n\nThe game was originally believed to have evolved from the original beer pong played with paddles which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of Dartmouth College in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual ping pong game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names \"Beer Pong\" and \"Beirut\" were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.\n\nBucknell University's student-run newspaper, \"The Bucknellian\", claims Delta Upsilon fraternity members at Bucknell created \"Throw Pong\", a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s, and that \"Throw Pong\" was then brought to Lehigh University by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.\n\nIn some places, \"Beer Pong\" refers to the version of the game with paddles, and \"Beirut\" to the version without. However, according to a CollegeHumor survey, \"beer pong\" is the more common term than \"Beirut\" for the paddle-less game.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Beirut\" is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in the \"Daily Princetonian,\" the student newspaper at Princeton University, suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the Lebanese Civil War. Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly mortar fire.\n\nBeer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.\n\nAlthough the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables. However, the game can be played on any flat surface.\n\nThe most common cups used are disposable plastic cups (such as red Solo cups) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team. Games typically use ten cups. Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.\nAn inexpensive pale lager or light beer of 3.2–5% ABV is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games. Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at Utah State University, where alcohol is not allowed on campus; root beer is used instead. For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.\n\nTraditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth \"official\" rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of \"house rules\" which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. \"West Coast rules\") or may vary on a \"house-by-house\" basis. Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.\n\nThe order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth. A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for \"\"re-racking\" (also known as \"reforming\", \"rearranging\", \"consolidation\"\", and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team's remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to \"re-rack\" the cups into a single triangle formation.\n\nCommon house rules allow players to 'finger' or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs allowing each player to shoot again. In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.\n\nBefore shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as \"E. coli\". As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.\n\nThere are three common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or \"laser, snipe, kamikaze\"), and the bounce shot. The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.\n\nSome players throw \"fastball\" style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup. A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.\n\nA bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.\n\nIf a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption. If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.\n\nAnother 'house rule' can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a shutout. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going streaking (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.\n\nAlso depending on 'house rules', there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.\n\nThe game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become drunken or even intoxicated enough to suffer alcohol poisoning. Also, the supposed cleaning effects of the water \"dunk\" cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups.\n\nSome writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to \"out of control\" college drinking.\n\nSome municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong, either from bars or in general, due to the belief that it encourages binge drinking (see Health Effects above). In Oxford, Ohio, where Miami University is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors. In Arlington, Virginia and Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments. In the fall of 2007, Georgetown University officially banned all beer pong paraphernalia such as custom-built tables and the possession of many ping-pong balls.\n\n\"Time\" magazine ran an article on July 31, 2008 called \"The War Against Beer Pong\", noting legal restrictions and bans on the game in college and elsewhere.\n\nIn many states, players have taken to placing water in cups in order to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples of this can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nBeer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.\n\nThe World Series of Beer Pong (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada. WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.\n\nA more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level. Ordinarily, a group of pong enthusiasts will create teams (partnerships) and play weekly against each other. Sometimes, the leagues have websites, rankings and statistics, while others have been started by college students with the goal of intramural competition such as at University of California, Santa Barbara with the \"Isla Vista Beer Pong League\", and at New York University.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Time\" and other media outlets have reported on the increase in businesses selling beer pong paraphernalia, such as tables, mats, cups, or clothes. \"Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong\" is a documentary which follows some competitive players as they prepare for the WSOBP II and ultimately compete against one another for the $20,000 grand prize. This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the CineVegas film festival on June 13, 2008. Rick Reilly wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for \"ESPN The Magazine\".\n\nThe Associated Press cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.\n\n\"Time\" magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong and posted a video on their website. In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to billiards and darts.\n\nThe game has been a recurring segment on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as Betty White, Serena Williams, Anna Kournikova, Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.\n\n\"\", a sequel to the 2000 comedy \"Road Trip\", featured the game prominently. Agnes Scott College, where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, Chronicle Books published \"The Book of Beer Pong\", a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.\n\nBud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer Anheuser-Busch said involved the drinking of water, not Budweiser or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing \"bud pong\" kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in \"The New York Times\" as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.\n\n\"The New York Times\" quoted a bartender at a club near Clemson University as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had \"never seen anyone playing with water. It's always beer. It's just like any other beer pong.\"\n\nSome expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch's public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: \"Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It's preposterous,\" while advertising news site Adjab opined that \"someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the rolling paper he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco.\"\n\nHowever, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.\n\nIn July 2008, JV Games Inc. released a downloadable video game for the Wii console called \"Frat Party Games: Beer Pong\". After much outrage by parent and university groups, the game was renamed \"\" and all references to alcohol were removed.\n"}

It was originally played to celebrate the annual Shiite festival, the Mourning of Muharram. In 1910, R.J Wilkinson, a Straits Civil Service officer and a noted scholar of Malay studies, made a comparison between the boria of Madras and Penang, and established that the resemblance was only in name, for the show as then known in Penang had evolved to a totally different form.\n\nA typical Boria troupe consists of a leader, a chorus, comedians and musicians.

{"id": "1227744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1227744", "title": "Bourgeois tragedy", "text": "Bourgeois tragedy\n\nBourgeois tragedy (German: \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\") is a form of tragedy that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.\n\nThere are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see domestic tragedy), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: George Lillo's \"The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell\", which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first \"tragédie bourgeoise\" was \"Sylvie\" by Paul Landois, which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by Denis Diderot: \"Le fils naturel\" was first staged in 1757 and \"Le père de famille\" in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.\n\nWhile ordinary people had always been the subject of comedies, classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. Aristotle articulates this idea in \"ars poetica\" (\"The Poetics\") and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German Martin Opitz, perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as Andreas Gryphius' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King Charles I of England), Jean Racine's Phèdre (the wife of Theseus, a mythical king of Athens) or William Shakespeare's King Lear, serve as tragic protagonists.\n\nIn Germany, where the new genre was called \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\", it was especially successful. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play \"Miss Sara Sampson\", which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\" in Germany. However, Christian Leberecht Martini's drama \"Rhynsolt und Sapphira\" is slightly older. Lessing's \"Emilia Galotti\" of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\". Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are \"Die Soldaten\" by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1776) and Friedrich Schiller's \"Kabale und Liebe\" (1784). \n\nBourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.\n"}
{"id": "4491426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4491426", "title": "Buttered cat paradox", "text": "Buttered cat paradox\n\nThe buttered cat paradox is a common joke based on the tongue-in-cheek combination of two adages:\n\n\nThe paradox arises when one considers what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height. The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist John Frazee of Kingston, New York, won a 1993 \"OMNI\" magazine competition about paradoxes. The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler Michael Davis, appearing on \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\", July 22, 1988.\n\nSome people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an anti-gravity effect. They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a steady state of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat’s feet attempt to land on the ground.\nIn June 2003, Kimberly Miner won a Student Academy Award for her film \"Perpetual Motion\". Miner based her film on a paper written by a high-school friend that explored the potential implications of the cat and buttered toast idea.\n\nThe faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented humorists. In May 1992, the Usenet Oracle Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox. Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the comic book strip \"Jack B. Quick\", the title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground, with the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion. The March 31, 2005, strip of the webcomic \"Bunny\" also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a \"Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator\", based on Sod's law. In \"Science Askew\", Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.\n\nThe idea appeared on the British panel game \"QI\", where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included:\n\nThe paradox also appeared in the episode \"Gravitational Anarchy\" of the scientific podcast \"Radiolab\". Later, a humoristic explainer animation was put together by the animated production company Barq, based on an extracted audio clip from the \"Radiolab\" episode.\n\nBrazilian energy drink brand Flying Horse has released an award-winning commercial that simulates the recreation of this phenomenon, which is then used to create perpetual energy.\n\nIt also appeared in a comics series called \"Kid Paddle\" where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table. The comic is fairly popular in France and Belgium.\n\nIn reality, cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the cat righting reflex. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height, about .\n\nToast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at Manchester Metropolitan University involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1639065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639065", "title": "Competitive eating", "text": "Competitive eating\n\nCompetitive eating, or speed eating, is an activity in which participants compete against each other to consume large quantities of food, usually in a short time period. Contests are typically eight to ten minutes long, although some competitions can last up to thirty minutes, with the person consuming the most food being declared the winner. Competitive eating is most popular in the United States, Canada and Japan, where organized professional eating contests often offer prizes, including cash.\n\nTraditionally, eating contests, often involving pies, were events at county fairs. The recent surge in the popularity of competitive eating is due in large part to the development of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, an annual holiday tradition that has been held on July 4 virtually every year since the 1970s at Coney Island. In 2001, Takeru Kobayashi ate 50 hot dogs – smashing the previous record (25.5). The event generates enormous media attention and has been aired on ESPN for the past eight years, contributing to the growth of the competitive eating phenomenon. Takeru Kobayashi won it consistently from 2001 through 2006. He was dethroned in 2007 by Joey Chestnut. In 2008, Chestnut and Kobayashi tied at 59 hot dogs in 10 minutes (the time span had previously been 12 minutes), and Chestnut won in an eat off in which he was the first of the two competitors to finish eating 5 hot dogs in overtime, earning Chestnut his second consecutive title. Chestnut still holds the world record of 69 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes for the 2013 competition. Kobayashi holds six Guinness Records, for eating hot dogs, meatballs, Twinkies, hamburgers, and pizza. He competed in hot dog contests in 2011 and 2012 and claimed to have eaten 68 and 69. \nThe current champion is Joey Chestnut, with a total of 74 hot dogs and buns eaten on July 4, 2018.\n\nAll Pro Eating Competitive Eaters include Molly Schuyler, Eric \"Silo\" Dahl, Jamie \"The Bear\" McDonald and Stephanie \"Xanadu\" Torres.\n\nThe International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE) hosts nearly 50 \"Major League Eating\" events across North America every year.\n\nOther eating contests sponsored by restaurants can involve a challenge to eat large or extraordinarily spicy food items, including giant steaks, hamburgers and curries in a set amount of time. Those who finish the item are often rewarded by not having to pay for the item, or with a T-shirt and the addition of their name and/or photo on a wall of challenge victors. For example, Ward's House of Prime located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has a prime rib meat challenge. The current record is 360 ounces by Molly Schuyler in June 2017. Various challenges of this type are featured in the Travel Channel show \"Man v. Food\".\n\nThe Great American Eat Off - a show that pits two average eaters against each other to see who can eat the fastest, while raising awareness for charity and then brings in a professional competitive eater to beat the winning time, raises the stakes for competitive eaters by incorporating various challenges and obstacles that would interfere with their speed. Obstacles may include eating with two spoons, eating with no hands, or Interval Eating where the competitive eat is permitted to eat for a limited time and then must rest for a specific time (i.e., eat 20 seconds, rest 40 seconds, eat 20 seconds, rest 40 seconds etc.) until they have completed the designated food. Interval Eating was created by Gail Kasper.\n\nThe type of food used in contests varies greatly, with each contest typically only using one type of food (e.g. a hot dog eating contest). Foods used in professional eating contests include hamburgers, hot dogs, pies, pancakes, chicken wings, asparagus, pizza, ribs, whole turkeys, among many other types of food. There is also a vegan hot dog eating competition held in Austin, Texas.\n\nCompetitive eating contests often adhere to an 8, 10, 12, or 15 minute time limit. Most contests are presided over by a master of ceremonies, whose job is to announce the competitors prior to the contest and keep the audience engaged throughout the contest with enthusiastic play-by-play commentary and amusing anecdotes. A countdown from 10 usually takes place at the end of the contest, with all eating coming to an end with the expiration of time.\n\nMany professional contests also employ a series of judges, whose role is to enforce the contest rules and warn eaters about infractions. Judges will also be called upon to count or weigh each competitor's food and certify the results of the contest prior to the winner being announced.\n\nMany eaters will attempt to put as much food in their mouths as possible during the final seconds of a contest, a practice known by professionals as \"chipmunking.\" If chipmunking is allowed in a contest, eaters are given a reasonable amount of time (typically less than two minutes) to swallow the food or risk a deduction from their final totals.\n\nIn many contests, except those adhering to \"picnic style rules\" mentioned previously, eaters are allowed to dunk foods in water or other liquids in order to soften the food and make it easier to chew and swallow. Dunking typically takes place with foods involving a bun or other doughy parts. Professional contests often enforce a limit on the number of times competitors are allowed to dunk food.\n\nCompetitors are required to maintain a relatively clean eating surface throughout the contest. Excess debris after the contest results in a deduction from the eater's final totals.\n\nIf, at any point during or immediately after the contest, a competitor regurgitates any food, he or she will be disqualified. Vomiting, also known as a \"reversal\", or, as ESPN and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest call it, a \"reversal of fortune\", includes obvious signs of vomiting as well as any small amounts of food that may fall from the mouth deemed by judges to have come from the stomach. Small amounts of food already in the mouth prior to swallowing are excluded from this rule.\n\nMany professional competitive eaters undergo rigorous personal training in order to increase their stomach capacity and eating speed with various foods. Stomach elasticity is usually considered the key to eating success, and competitors commonly train by drinking large amounts of water over a short time to stretch out the stomach. Others combine the consumption of water with large quantities of low calorie foods such as vegetables or salads. Some eaters chew large amounts of gum in order to build jaw strength.\n\nFor a marquee event like the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, some eaters, like current contest champion Joey Chestnut, will begin training several months before the event with personal time trials using the contest food. Retired competitive eater Ed \"Cookie\" Jarvis trained by consuming entire heads of boiled cabbage followed by drinking up to two gallons of water every day for two weeks before a contest. Due to the risks involved with training alone or without emergency medical supervision, the IFOCE actively discourages training of any sort.\n\n\nThe chief criticism of competitive eating is the message the gluttonous sport sends as obesity levels rise among Americans and the example it sets for youth.\n\nOthers, like actor Ryan Reynolds in an editorial on \"The Huffington Post\", contend that competitive eating is yet another example of Western gluttony at a time when so many others around the world are starving. In the same article, retired competitive eater Don \"Moses\" Lerman foreshadows the dangers of competitive eating when he admits \"I'll stretch my stomach until it causes internal bleeding.\"\n\nThe argument that competitive eating can cause weight gain, which may lead to obesity and elevated cholesterol and blood pressure, is common. The potential damage that competitive eating can cause to the human digestive system was the subject of a 2007 study by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The study observed professional eater Tim Janus, who ate 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes before doctors intervened. It was concluded that through training, Janus' stomach failed to have normal muscle contractions called peristalsis, a function which transfers food from the stomach down the digestive tract.\n\nOther medical professionals contend that binge eating can cause stomach perforations in those with ulcers and gulping large quantities of water during training can lead to water intoxication, a condition which dilutes electrolytes in the blood. Gastroparesis, also known as stomach paralysis, is also a concern among those who routinely stretch their stomachs beyond capacity. The condition may lead to the stomach's inability to contract and lose its ability to empty itself. Side effects of gastroparesis include chronic indigestion, nausea and vomiting.\n\nIn October 2012, a 32-year-old man died while competitively eating live roaches and worms in a contest to win a ball python. An autopsy revealed he choked to death. On July 4, 2014, a 47-year-old competitive eater similarly choked to death during a hot dog eating contest. At a Sacred Heart University event on April 2, 2017, a 20-year-old female student died as a result of a pancake-eating contest.\n\n\n\n"}

This subgenre contrasts with classical and Neoclassical tragedy, in which the protagonists are of kingly or aristocratic rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. \n\nThe Ancient Greek theorist Aristotle had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. \n\nIn Britain, the first domestic tragedies were written in the English Renaissance; one of the first was \"Arden of Faversham\" (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are \"A Woman Killed with Kindness\" (1607), \"A Yorkshire Tragedy\" (1608), and \"The Witch of Edmonton\" (1621). \"Othello\" can be classified as a domestic tragedy.\n\nDomestic tragedy disappeared during the era of Restoration drama, when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of George Lillo and Sir Richard Steele in the eighteenth century.\n\n"}
{"id": "155890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155890", "title": "Dramaturgy", "text": "Dramaturgy\n\nDramaturgy is the study of dramatic composition and the representation of the main elements of drama on the stage.\n\nThe term first appears in the eponymous work \"Hamburg Dramaturgy\" (1767–69) by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world's first dramaturge at the Hamburg National Theatre. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual. Some dramatists combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a dramaturge, to adapt a work for the stage.\n\nDramaturgy may also be broadly defined as \"adapting a story to actable form.\" Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and structure. Often the dramaturge's strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current Zeitgeist through cross-cultural signs, theater and film historical references to genre, ideology, role of gender representation etc. in the dramatization.\n\nDramaturgy is a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (the author of well known plays such as \"Miss Sara Sampson\", \"Emilia Galotti\", \"Minna von Barnhelm\", and \"Nathan the Wise\") in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as \"dramaturge\". He was first of this kind and described his task as ‘\"dramatic judge\" (\"dramatischer Richter\") who has to be able to tell the difference between the stake the play has or the main actor or the director to make us feel comfortable or not while watching a theatrical performance. From 1767–1770 Lessing wrote and published as result a series of criticisms titled \"Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie).\" These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the German theatre, and made Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.\n\nBased on Lessing's \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\" (Lessing and Berghahn, 1981) and \"Laokoon\" and Hegel’s \"Aesthetics\" (written 1835–1838), many authors, including Hölderlin, Goethe, Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, started to reflect on theater, not only in Germany.,\n\nGustav Freytag summed up those reflections in his book \"The Technique of the Drama\", which has been translated into English and published in the late 19th century in the USA. Freytag's book is seen as the blueprint for the first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. \"The Technique of Play Writing\" by Charlton Andrews, 1915, refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.\n\nAnother important work in the Western theatrical tradition is \"Poetics\" by Aristotle (written around 335 BC). In this work Aristotle analyzes tragedy. Aristotle considers \"Oedipus Rex\" (c. 429 BC) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among character, action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and examines the reactions the plays provoke in the audience. Many of his \"rules\" are referred to today as \"Aristotelian drama\". In \"Poetics\", Aristotle discusses many key concepts of drama, such as anagnorisis and catharsis.\n\n\"Poetics\" is the earliest surviving Western work of dramatic theory. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the Sanskrit work \"Natya Shastra\" (\"The Art of Theatre\"), written around 500 BCE to 500 CE, which describes the elements, forms and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian dramas.\n\nDramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is the resident expert on the physical, social, political, and economic milieus in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.\n\nInstitutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including casting of the play, offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress, and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy. Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play's history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.\n\nSince dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.\n\nIn 1996, there was debate based on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, such as the case of Jonathan Larson, the author of the musical \"Rent\" and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of \"Rent\" and grant her 16% of the author's share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a Broadway hit, the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15% of the royalties of \"Angels in America\" go to playwright Tony Kushner's dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court's ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of \"Rent\" and that she was not entitled to royalties. The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.\n\n\n\n"}

It sometimes also has elements of cabaret, circus, revue, variety, vaudeville and mime. \"Extravaganza\" may more broadly refer to an elaborate, spectacular, and expensive theatrical production.\n\nThe term was widely used to describe a type of 19th-century British drama made popular by James Planché. Planché defined it as \"the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject.\"\n\nThe term is derived from the Italian word \"stravaganza\", meaning extravagance.\n\n"}
{"id": "3480573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3480573", "title": "Fiction writing", "text": "Fiction writing\n\nFiction writing is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a short story, novel, novella, screenplay, or drama, which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of authors practice fictional writing, including novelists, playwrights, short story writers, dramatists and screenwriters.\n\nA genre is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, science fiction, fantasy and mystery fiction are genres. Genre fiction also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.\n\nGenre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is the \"Twilight\" series which may sell more than Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\", because the \"Twilight\" novels deal with elements of pop culture – romance and vampires.\n\nLiterary fiction is fictional works that hold literary merit, that is to say, they are works that offer social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on aspect of the human condition.\n\nLiterary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or genre fiction. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is controversial among some critics and scholars.\n\nCharacterization is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style. A character is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.\n\nCharacters may be of several types:\n\nThe plot, or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.\n\nPlot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.\n\nThe climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.\n\nPlot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.\n\nSetting is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe. Sometimes setting is referred to as milieu, to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.\n\nTheme is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the \"moral of the story.\" Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.\n\nStyle includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of narrator, but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.\n\nFor each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.\n\nThe narrator is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.\n\nPoint of view is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal \"lens\") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.\n\nThe tone of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.\n\nErnest Hemingway wrote \"Prose is architecture, not interior decoration.\"\n\nStephen King, in his non-fiction, part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, \"\", he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: \"Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's.\"\n\nKurt Vonnegut the author of praised novels \"Cat's Cradle\", \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", and \"Breakfast of Champions\", has given his readers, from his short story collection, \"Bagombo Snuff Box\", eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.\n\n\"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17046772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17046772", "title": "Fictional portrayals of psychopaths", "text": "Fictional portrayals of psychopaths\n\nFictional portrayals of psychopaths, or sociopaths, are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of psychopathy, which is itself used with varying definitions by mental health professionals, criminologists and others. The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or critics based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.\n\nSuch characters are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically in the role of a villain or antihero, where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions and criteria in the history of psychopathy have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several stereotypical images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming con artist, the deranged serial killer, the successful corporate psychopath, or the chronic low-level offender with juvenile delinquency. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical bogeyman, fascination with human evil, and sometimes perhaps envy of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of guilt, anguish or insecurity.\n\nIn the 19th century the diagnostic categories of monomania or moral insanity (the word 'moral' then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature, covering numerous eccentricities, obsessions or breakdowns—and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality, occasionally violent. This period also saw the rise of crime fiction such as sensation novels, where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane, and detective novels, playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities. The term 'psychopath' came into use in the late 19th century (as did the term it would often be confused with, psychotic), and also spanned a very wide range of conditions (etymologically and originally equivalent to 'mentally ill'). Nevertheless, an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder, contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty. 'Psychopaths' began to appear in vaudevilles, ditties (songs) and press articles. The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free, a usage still quoted in dictionaries today.\n\n'Degenerates' were also depicted in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways to the modern usages of the concept of psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis to justify eradicating their opposition.\n\nThe meaning gradually narrowed, initially as 'psychopathic inferiors' covering all of what today might be called personality disorders and various other conditions, then intertwining with the terminology of the 'sociopath' (and eventually antisocial personality disorder), though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways.\n\nEarly representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic, unpredictable, sexually depraved, and emotionally unstable (manic) characters with a compulsion to engage in random violence and destruction, usually with a series of bizarre mannerisms such as giggling, laughing, or facial tics. Up until the late 1950s, cinematic conventions usually relegated the psychopath to roles of genre villains such as gangsters, mad scientists, supervillains, and many types of generic criminals. Examples of this type are Pinkie Brown (Richard Attenborough) in \"Brighton Rock\", Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) in \"Kiss of Death\", Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) in \"White Heat\", and Antonio 'Tony' Camonte (Paul Muni) in the 1932 version of \"Scarface\". Homosexuals were also referred to as psychopaths under the broad definition then in use; the American Psychiatric Association in the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1952 would list it under 'sociopathic personality disturbance'.\n\nOne exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) in the 1931 Fritz Lang film \"M\". Lorre portrays Beckert as an outwardly unremarkable man tormented by a compulsion to ritualistically murder children. A German film (allegedly based on the real life serial killer Peter Kürten), it was released in America in 1933 and has been seen as indicative of a turning point in American media depictions of psychopaths. Until the 1930s psychiatrists typically applied the diagnosis to unemployed males or 'hypersexual' women, but several psychiatric, cultural and economic trends, together with sex crime panics, converged to transform the popular psychopath into a violent, male, sexual deviant or criminal—a threat to innocence, gender roles and the social order.\n\nThe Ostap Bender character from novels The Twelve Chairs and The Little Golden Calf by Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov is also considered a portrait of a charming psychopath.\n\nLennie Small from Of Mice and Men, who is mentally retarded, has been described as also lacking a conscience or moral sense, a common definition of a psychopath. His inability to stay out of trouble is often attributed to this.\n\nOne of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of Ed Gein, arrested in 1957. A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death, he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local cemetery, making various items out of their skin. Rumours spread that he was also a necrophiliac, cannibal or transvestite, though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to leading questions by interrogators. Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial, deemed to have had schizophrenia (psychosis including delusions and hallucinations) for at least 12 years, though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a 'sexual psychopath'. Robert Bloch, a prolific pulp horror author, says his 1959 novel \"Psycho\" was based on the Gein murders and the idea of an apparently sane person in a local community committing heinous crimes, but not necessarily on Gein himself, despite numerous similarities. The villain, Norman Bates, is portrayed as an outwardly unremarkable man who murders a woman while under the control of an alternate personality that takes the form of his domineering mother, who he himself murdered. Both the novel and Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film adaptation were influences on the popular media portrayal of psychopaths. Neither the book nor film elaborates on the term 'psycho', though it is commonly taken to refer to either psychotic or psychopath. At the end of the film, a psychiatrist describes Bates as having a split personality. Multiple personality disorder was at that time very popular (cf 1957 movie \"The Three Faces of Eve\") and is to this day commonly confused with schizophrenia. Bloch later wrote a script for the 1966 film \"The Psychopath\", the original working title for which was \"Schizo\".\n\nA different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters. The title of the 1955 film \"Rebel Without a Cause\", starring James Dean, came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the hypno-analysis of a diagnosed psychopath. In the book, psychiatrist Robert M. Lindner also discussed psychopaths in general as pointlessly selfish individuals who appear unable to accept society's rules. In Ken Kesey's 1962 novel \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", Randle McMurphy, after being admitted to a mental institution, is repeatedly referred to by the authorities, other patients and himself as a possible or definite psychopath. He reads from his record: \"repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath\", and adds that a doctor told him it means \"I fight and fuh-pardon me, ladies-means I am he put it overzealous in my sexual relations.\" The current doctor then reads out the note: \"Don't overlook the possibility that this man might be feigning psychosis\". In the script for the popular film adaptation in 1975, only the latter is retained and the term psychopath is never used. Ironically, the main authority figure in the hospital—the cold, sadistic Nurse Ratched—was later described as a psychopath under later understandings of the term.\n\nThe 1973 film \"Badlands\" involved two lead characters based loosely on Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate. While the male lead Kit (Martin Sheen) is sometimes described as a psychopath or sociopath, psychologist Robert D. Hare, a leading proponent of the assessment of psychopathy, has identified Holly (Sissy Spacek) as exemplifying his concept of a psychopath due to her poor emotional sense of the meaning of events and her attempted mask of normality. However, writer and director Terrence Malick has said he considered Kit's shallow, bitter insensitivity to be a result of suffering and neglect growing up in the Midwest, and 15-year-old Holly, though immature and mis-estimating her audience, to be a quite typical Southern girl wanting to help narrate and come off well but still give the hard facts, and not dwell on herself or on personal tragedies.\n\nThe increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century, fueled by cases such as John Wayne Gacy (1978), Ted Bundy (1978) and Jeffrey Dahmer (1991), lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature, sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late-19th century literature with the high-functioning behaviors detected in some serial killers.\n\nThe psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, most notably portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in the Academy Award-winning 1991 film \"The Silence of the Lambs\", is perhaps the most infamous fictional psychopath of the 20th century. Lecter is intelligent and sophisticated (whereas psychopathy is generally associated with lower than average verbal intelligence), and his disarming charisma and wit disguise his true nature as a serial killer. He spends most of the film in a cell, taunting Clarice Starling with clues to the identity of another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, in exchange for intimate details of Starling's troubled childhood. Lecter first appeared in Thomas Harris' 1981 novel \"Red Dragon\", in which he is characterized as not fitting any known psychological profile. In the film adaptation of \"The Silence of the Lambs\", he is referred to as a \"pure psychopath\". In the later novels \"Hannibal\" and \"Hannibal Rising\", Lecter's psychopathy is portrayed as the result of seeing his sister Mischa murdered and cannibalized during World War II. In 2013 Harris revealed that he originally based the Lecter character on Alfredo Ballí Trevino, a Mexican physician who had killed and dismembered his homosexual lover, in what was called a crime of passion over a financial dispute.\n\nThe novel \"American Psycho\" tells the story of Patrick Bateman, a yuppie serial killer working on Wall Street in the 1980s. It was made into a film in 2000. Author Bret Easton Ellis has told interviewers that the book is a satire on shallow consumerist lifestyles, but also that the writing of the violent scenes was based on fictional horror and FBI material on serial killers, along with how he imagined \"a psychotic who worked on Wall Street\" would describe such incidents. Some commentary, including in scientific journals, has suggested the Bateman character appears to be a psychopath. However, Bateman also exhibits signs of psychosis such as hallucinations, and as such appears to be an unreliable narrator; it is left ambiguous whether Bateman is actually a serial killer, or is merely hallucinating about committing murder. In Ellis' 1998 novel \"Glamorama\" which features models-turned-terrorists a character also remarks \"basically, everyone was a sociopath...and all the girls' hair was chignoned.\"\n\nIn the 1993 book \"Girl, Interrupted\" and its 1999 film adaptation, the character of Lisa (played by Angelina Jolie in the film) is a rebellious, antisocial young woman who is diagnosed as a sociopath. However, it is left ambiguous whether that diagnosis is accurate.\n\nThe 1996 film \"Primal Fear\" depicts a suspected murderer who appears to suffer from multiple personality disorder, who at the end reveals that he has been faking the disorder. In the original novel by William Diehl, the psychiatrist Molly Arrington and others repeatedly explain psychopathy and psychosis as if they are the same, inherently antisocial, condition.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" author J. K. Rowling has described Lord Voldemort, the series' main villain, as \"a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world\".\n\nNumerous characters in television shows are informally described as psychopaths by the actors who play the parts. Examples include Natalie Buxton in \"Bad Girls\", Sean Slater and Michael Moon in \"EastEnders\", and Dexter Morgan in the American show \"Dexter.\" \n\nDavid Platt from the British TV soap \"Coronation Street\", is also known for having a serious personality disorder. His character is famous for presenting several tendencies of a sociopathic personality including, manipulation, lying, and aggression. He has served time in prison and often blames his mother for his traumatic childhood, His character has matured over the years however, the mask tends to slip from time to time and he returns to his darker side, most recently when he helped hide a dead body with a terrifying, cold-hearted attitude.\n\nDr. Gregory House, the title character in the FOX medical-thriller \"House\" is referred to as a sociopath multiple times by several characters throughout the course of the show.\n\nSherlock Holmes, the lead character in the BBC series \"Sherlock\", is referred to as a psychopath multiple times throughout the course of the show; in response to these claims, Holmes describes himself as a \"high-functioning sociopath\". He has also been described as having Asperger syndrome.\n\nThe Dan Wells novel \"I Am Not a Serial Killer\" and its sequels, \"Mr. Monster\" and \"I Don't Want To Kill You\", are narrated by John Wayne Cleaver, a teenaged diagnosed sociopath who lives by a rigid code of behavior in order to avoid becoming a serial killer.\n\nOne Chicago academic has argued in a review of TV trends that the contemporary fantasy of sociopathy/psychopathy is of someone whose emotional disconnection from others in society, rather than being the hindrance that it can represent in real clinical cases, enables them to be an amazingly successful manipulator due to a breakdown in the social contract.\n\nContemporary advice on writing psychopathic/sociopathic characters suggests that lack of a conscience and lack of empathy are always the chief characteristics, along with an ability to fool others, while the type of selfish antisocial behavior, and any secondary characteristics, can vary.\n\nIn 2013, the video console game \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was released with numerous references to psychopaths and sociopaths, including reports from a fictional psychiatrist. One of the lead characters, Trevor, is described both psychopathic and psychotic; the voice actor who played the part says he based his performance on Tom Hardy's portrayal of Charles Bronson in the film \"Bronson\".\n\nJacob M. Appel's \"The Mask of Sanity\" depicts a high-functioning sociopath, Jeremy Balint, who gains fame as a cardiologist while killing strangers..\n\nThe character Villanelle in Killing Eve refers to herself as a psychopath.. Her character portrays many of the traits from both sociopath and psychopath with a lack of empathy in her methods of murdering her victims or showing any guilt or remorse after the event.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "182053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182053", "title": "Gamer", "text": "Gamer\n\nA gamer is a person who plays interactive games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games, and skill-based card games, and who plays for usually long periods of time. In some countries, such as the UK, the term \"gaming\" can also refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional tabletop and digital forms. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube/Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs.\n\nIn the United States, the average video game player is 30 years old and has been playing video games for over 12 years. In the UK as of 2007, the average video game player was over 23 years old, had played video games for over 10 years, and spent around 11 hours a week playing video games. According to Pew Research Center, 49% percent of adults have played a video game at some point in their life. Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'\n\nA female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.\nAccording to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games. Usage of the term \"girl gamer\" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.\n\nAlthough men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a stereotype that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more casual games which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.\n\nA gaymer, or gay gamer, is a person within the group of people who identify themselves as LGBT (gay, bisexual, lesbian, or transgender) and have an active interest in video games. This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys, one in 2006, which noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure, and another in 2009, focusing on the content that gaymers expect in video games.\nThe gaymer community provides a \"safe place\" for LGBT gamers apart from the isolation they feel from both the heteronormative gaming community and the gay community. They also believe that as homosexuality in video games increase, there will be an increased normalization of homosexuality in general. \"Gaymers are the future of video games\" said Hamed Hosseini, who is married to Mahar Buar, in Valve's gaming convention.\n\nIt is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.\n\n\nProfessional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in competitions. A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly South Korea and China, professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than 100,000 a year. In 2006 Major League Gaming contracted several \"Halo 2\" players including Tom \"Tsquared\" Taylor and members of Team Final Boss with $250,000 USD yearly deals.\n\nA retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, retro games—older video games and arcade games. They may also be called \"classic gamers\" or \"old-school gamers\", which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via emulation, or on modern hardware via ports or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).\n\nA number of taxonomies have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.\n\nThe Bartle taxonomy of player types classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\nThe MDA framework describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (\"Mechanics\"), how they build up during game to develop the gameplay (\"Dynamics\"), and what emotional response they convey to the player (\"Aesthetics\"). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. Jesse Schell extends this classification with Anticipation, Schadenfreude, Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.\n\nAn avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a pseudonym) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support, or at electronic sport conventions.\n\nSimilarly, a \"clan tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans. They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another. Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other. A \"team tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team. Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation. These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\nA clan, squad or guild is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator. Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of professional gamers, who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly performativity of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody. These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books. According to Graeme Kirkpatrick, the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with gameplay. Escapist founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"cinemaphile\".\nPeople who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify. Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.\n\nIn August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named Gamergate controversy. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. The Gamergate controversy concerns issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the Twitter hashtag #GamerGate. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.\n\nGames are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time. This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly. Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms. Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics. Market penetration of smartphones with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience, since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.\n\nWhile 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers. This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female PC gamers in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers. Connotations of \"gamer\" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.\n\nRacial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of hispanics identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of African-Americans and 7% of whites. The competitive fighting game scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant. This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a quarter. Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.\n\nCasualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly. Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of gameplay in established genres and franchises. Compared to seminal titles like \"DOOM\", more recent mass-market action games like the Call of Duty series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of interactive movies. The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in retro games but missing from new releases.\n\nThe trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game. According to Brendan Keogh, these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity. Belying these trends, games including \"The Sims\" or \"Minecraft\" have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex. According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are \"just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays \"Counter-Strike\"\" Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.\n\n"}
{"id": "55516959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55516959", "title": "Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations", "text": "Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations\n\nIn October 2017, the \"New York Times\" and the \"New Yorker\" reported that dozens of women accused American film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse over a period of at least 30 years. More than 80 women in the film industry have since accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied \"any non-consensual sex\". Shortly after the local news stations reported Weinstein's allegations, he was dismissed from The Weinstein Company, expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other professional associations, and disappeared from public view.\n\nCriminal investigations into complaints from at least six women are ongoing in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. On May 25, 2018, Weinstein was arrested in New York, charged with rape and other offenses, and released on bail.\n\nThe \"Times\" and the \"New Yorker\" jointly won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their reporting on Weinstein. The scandal triggered many similar allegations against powerful men around the world, and led to the ousting of many of them from their positions. It also led a great number of women to share their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, or rape on social media under the hashtag #MeToo. The scandal's impact on powerful men in various industries came to be called the \"Weinstein effect\". \n\nHarvey Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, formed the film production company Miramax and led the company from 1979 to 2005. In March 2005, the Weinsteins founded The Weinstein Company (TWC) and departed from Miramax that September.\n\nRumors of Harvey Weinstein's \"casting couch\" practices circulated in Hollywood for years, and entertainment figures at times alluded to them. As early as 1998, Gwyneth Paltrow said on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that Weinstein \"will coerce you to do a thing or two\". In 2005, Courtney Love advised young actresses in an interview, \"If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don't go.\" In 2010, an article titled \"Harvey's Girls\" for \"Pajiba\" alluded to Weinstein's \"casting couch\" reputation: \"Every few years, Harvey picks a new girl as his pet\". In 2012, a character on the TV series \"30 Rock\" said: \"I'm not afraid of anyone in show business, I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions, out of five.\" While announcing the 2013 nominees for the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award, Seth MacFarlane joked: \"Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\" After the allegations were published, director Quentin Tarantino said that he had known about Weinstein harassing actresses for decades, and had confronted him about it. Ivana Lowell wrote in her book \"Why Not Say What Happened?\", published in 2010, about misbehavior by Weinstein when she worked for the books division of Miramax. The incidents described were in her office when she was alone with Harvey Weinstein, and in her home when a female friend of hers was present. She wrote that she \"knew about Harvey's reputation as a womanizer; tales of his trying to seduce every young actress in town were infamous.\"\n\nJournalists wrote or attempted to write about Weinstein's alleged behavior. David Carr found that no one allegedly assaulted by Weinstein would speak on the record; Ken Auletta and his editors decided that he could not mention an assault allegation without cooperation from the victim. In 2015, Jordan Sargent wrote in his Gawker article \"Tell Us What You Know About Harvey Weinstein's 'Open Secret'\" that \"rumors of the powerful producer leveraging his industry power for sexual satisfaction—consensual or otherwise—have tended to remain unaired, confined to hushed conversation and seedier gossip-blog comment threads.\" \"The New York Times\" later wrote that Weinstein had built a \"wall of invulnerability\", in part through his support of leading Democratic politicians. He boasted of being friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. The Clintons continued longstanding close relationships with him despite alleged warnings about Weinstein to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign from Lena Dunham and Tina Brown.\n\nIn 2015 \"The New York Times\" reported that Weinstein was questioned by police \"after a 22-year-old woman accused him of touching her inappropriately\". The woman, Italian model Ambra Gutierrez, cooperated with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to obtain an audio recording where Weinstein admitted to having inappropriately touched her. As the police investigation progressed and became public, tabloids published negative stories about Gutierrez that portrayed her as an opportunist. American Media, publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", allegedly agreed to help suppress the allegations by Gutierrez and Rose McGowan. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. decided not to file charges against Weinstein, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent, against the advice of local police who considered the evidence sufficient. The New York district attorney's office and the NYPD blamed each other for failing to bring charges.\n\nIn July 2018, after many allegations and criminal charges of sexual misconduct, Greek journalist Taki Theodoracopulos reported in \"The Spectator\" that his friend Weinstein told him in an interview that \"yes, I did offer them [girls] acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so did and still does everyone.\" Weinstein's lawyer later said that he had been present and that Weinstein had not said that, and Theodoracopulos stated that he \"may have misrepresented\" Weinstein.\n\nSubstantial allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein were first reported by \"The New York Times\" journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on October 5, 2017. The story accused Weinstein of three decades of sexually harassing and paying eight settlements to actresses and female Miramax and Weinstein Company production assistants, temps, and other employees.\n\nFive days later, on October 10, NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow reported in \"The New Yorker\" further allegations that Weinstein had sexually assaulted or harassed 13 women, and raped three. Farrow said he had wanted to break the story months earlier with NBC but implied the network was under pressure not to publish, which NBC denied. According to Farrow, 16 former or current executives and assistants connected with Weinstein said that they had witnessed or had been informed of Weinstein's non-consensual sexual advances to women. Four actresses relayed their suspicion that, after rejecting Weinstein's advances and complaining about him, he had them removed from projects or persuaded others to remove them. A number of Farrow's sources said Weinstein had referred to his success in planting stories in the media about individuals who had crossed him. \"The New Yorker\" also published the 2015 audio recording in which Weinstein admits to groping Gutierrez.\n\nThat November, Farrow reported that Weinstein had, through the lawyer David Boies, employed the private intelligence agencies Kroll, Black Cube and private investigator Jack Palladino. They were charged with spying on and influencing Weinstein's alleged victims as well as Kantor, Twohey, Farrow and other reporters who were investigating Weinstein, so as to prevent his conduct from becoming public.\n\nIncluding the initial reporting in 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault or rape. A group of them, led by Italian actress Asia Argento, released a list of over 100 alleged instances of sexual abuse by Weinstein in November 2017. The incidents alleged in the list date from 1980 to 2015, and include 18 allegations of rape.\n\nAccording to the women's reports, Weinstein invited young actresses or models into a hotel room or office on the pretext of discussing their career, and then demand massages or sex. He told them that complying with his demands would help their careers, repeatedly mentioning Paltrow (without the actress's knowledge) as someone he claimed to have had sex with.\n\nFormer colleagues and collaborators of Weinstein told reporters that these activities were enabled by employees, associates, and agents who set up these meetings, and lawyers and publicists who suppressed complaints with payments and threats; Bob Weinstein, for example, was allegedly involved in three settlements with accusers, the first in 1990. One Miramax executive reported being harassed by Weinstein after being promoted and praised by him; she and other employees allegedly found that the HR department protected Weinstein more than his employees.\n\nWomen who said they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein include:\n\nThe women who have accused Weinstein of rape include:\n\nIn response to the \"New York Times\" report, Weinstein said: \"I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.\" He said he was due to take a sabbatical and was working with therapists to \"deal with this issue head on\". His consulting lawyer, Lisa Bloom, described him as \"an old dinosaur learning new ways\". Bloom was criticized for her handling of Weinstein's defense and ended her involvement for Weinstein on October 7, 2017. Two days later, Weinstein hired public relations company Sitrick and Company, which specializes in crisis PR; they dropped Weinstein as a client on April 3, 2018. Weinstein's attorney Charles Harder said his client would be suing the \"Times\", but as of October 15, Harder was no longer working for Weinstein.\n\nIn response to the report in \"The New Yorker\", a spokesperson for Weinstein stated:\n\nSubsequent reports and accusations of rape were likewise met with the response that \"any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein\".\n\nOn January 30, 2018, Weinstein's attorney released private emails from Ben Affleck and Jill Messick, Rose McGowan's former manager, that both contradicted McGowan's version of the incident. On February 7, 2018 Messick committed suicide. Both the released email and McGowan's own accusations against Messick led to increased negative public and media attention towards Messick, including cyberbullying. Messick's family blamed Weinstein, McGowan, the media and the public for her death.\n\nIn March 2018, Weinstein's lawyer and spokesperson Benjamin Brafman said in an interview with \"The Times\" of London, \"The casting couch in Hollywood was not invented by Harvey Weinstein.\"...\"If a woman decides that she needs to have sex with a Hollywood producer to advance her career and actually does it and finds the whole thing offensive, that's not rape.\" Rhetorically addressing such a woman, Brafman said, \"You made a conscious decision that you're willing to do something that is personally offensive in order to advance your career.\"\n\nIn October 2017, the New York City Police Department (NYPD), London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) were reviewing allegations against Weinstein following the reporting about his conduct.\n\nThe NYPD said on November 3, 2017 that they were preparing a warrant to arrest Weinstein for his alleged rape of Paz de la Huerta, an investigation that was still pending as of May 2018 and unrelated to the later arrest of Weinstein.\n\nOn May 25, 2018, Weinstein was charged by New York prosecutors with \"rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women\" following a month long investigation. After surrendering to police, he appeared in court before Judge Kevin McGrath. If convicted on the most serious charges, Weinstein could face between 5 and 25 years in prison. Weinstein was released same day on a million dollars cash bail. He agreed to surrender his passport and to wear an ankle monitor confining him to Connecticut and New York. His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said Weinstein intends to plead not guilty.\n\nIn July 2018, Weinstein was indicted on an additional charge of \"predatory sexual assault\" against a woman he allegedly forced into oral sex in 2006. The charge has a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nOn October 11, 2018 a New York judge dismissed one of the sex assault charges against Weinstein.\n\nThe LAPD investigation concerns an allegation of rape by an unnamed actress.\n\nAs of February 2018, the London MPS were investigating 15 alleged sexual assaults by Weinstein, dating back to the 1990s. The investigation is dubbed \"Operation Kaguyak\".\n\nOn October 23, 2017, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened a civil rights investigation into The Weinstein Company (TWC). He issued a subpoena for records related to sexual harassment and discrimination complaints at the company.\n\nIn January 2018, Weinstein's former personal assistant Sandeep Rehal sued both Weinstein brothers and TWC for discrimination and harassment, alleging that much of her work involved \"catering to Harvey Weinstein's sexual appetites and activities\", including working while he was naked. Weinstein denied these allegations.\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Ashley Judd sued Weinstein for allegedly making false statements about her after she rejected his sexual requests which damaged her career and cost her a role in a \"Lord of the Rings\" movie.\n\nWeinstein's alleged actions were widely criticized by prominent persons in entertainment and politics. They triggered a public discussion about, as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) put it, \"willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment\" in the film industry.\n\nOn October 8, 2017, The Weinstein Company's (TWC) board of directors dismissed Weinstein, and he resigned from the company's board nine days later.\n\nAfter Weinstein's ouster was announced, several companies ended their collaborations with TWC, including Apple (October 9), Hachette (October 12), Amazon (October 13), Lexus and Ovation (October 25). The AMPAS, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), the Producers Guild of America (PGA), and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) also stripped Weinstein of their memberships.\n\nProminent politicians condemned Weinstein's actions. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama denounced Weinstein's reported behavior on October 10, 2017. French President Emmanuel Macron initiated the revocation of Weinstein's Legion of Honor title. In the UK, Labour members of parliament requested the revocation of Weinstein's Commander of the Order of the British Empire honorary title.\n\nSeveral politicians Weinstein had supported gave his donations to charities, including Democratic Senators Al Franken, Patrick Leahy, and Martin Heinrich.\n\nWeinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announced her divorce on October 10, 2017. That month, the University at Buffalo, Weinstein's alma mater, revoked his honorary degree, and Harvard University rescinded Weinstein's 2014 W. E. B. Du Bois medal.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2018, more than 300 Hollywood actresses and other women published an open letter in the daily newspapers \"The New York Times\" and \"La Opinión\" appealing to support the initiative Time's Up.\n\nThe October 2017 allegations against Weinstein precipitated an immediate \"national reckoning\" against sexual harassment and assault in the United States, known as the \"Weinstein effect\". Compounded by other sexual harassment cases earlier in the year, the Weinstein reports and the subsequent \"#MeToo\" hashtag campaign, which encouraged individuals to share their suppressed stories of sexual misconduct, created a cavalcade of allegations across multiple industries that brought about the swift ouster of many men in positions of power both in the United States and, as it spread, around the world. In the entertainment industry, allegations led to the ousters of actors and directors alike. Most prominently, actor Kevin Spacey, comedian Louis C.K., and filmmaker Brett Ratner had projects canceled following at least six allegations apiece. Over 200 women accused filmmaker James Toback of sexual harassment. In journalism, allegations led to the ousters of editors, publishers, executives, and hosts. In other industries, the celebrity chef John Besh and other executives in finance and public relations were removed. As of November 25, 2017, the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating 28 sex crime cases involving media figures.\n\n\"Time\" magazine dubbed the \"Silence Breakers\" behind the #MeToo movement \"Time\" Person of the Year in 2017. American journalists in conversation at NPR wrote of the series of allegations feeling like a tipping point for societal treatment of sexual misconduct, distinguished from prior sexual misconduct public debates by the public trust put in the celebrity accusers, as opposed to prior cases of publicly unknown accusers. Other journalists doubted that the trend would hold.\n\n\"The New York Times\" and \"The New Yorker\" jointly won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service \"for their coverage of the sexual abuse of women in Hollywood and other industries around the world\".\n\nThe \"Me Too\" campaign spread to other countries and languages over social media in Asia, Europe, Latin and North America.\n\nIn North America, Canadian comedy festival founder Gilbert Rozon resigned and over a dozen individuals accused Quebec television host and producer Éric Salvail of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn Europe, allegations against multiple British politicians created a public scandal and led to the suspension and resignations of three officials. In France, political organizations close to the Socialist Party, in particular the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF), were accused of systemic sexual harassment. The French daily newspaper \"Le Monde\" published in November 2017 two articles on alleged sexual harassment and predation supported by former UNEF presidents, Jean-Baptiste Prévost and Emmanuel Zemmour. In an editorial, more than 80 UNEF female members and militants came forward to accuse the Union of \"sexual violence\".\n"}
{"id": "56919832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56919832", "title": "Horké léto", "text": "Horké léto\n\nHorké léto is a video game series, beginning with Horké léto a 1998 Czech adventure game developed by Czech studio Maxon and published by JRC Interactive. A sequel entitled Horké léto 2: Majer se vrací was developed by Centauri Production and published in 1999 by JRC Interactive. Žhavé léto 3 ½ rounds off the trilogy as a 2006 action/adventure/driving game developed by Centauri Production and CINEMAX,and published by Akella. Evil Days of Luckless John (Czech: Žhavé léto 3 ½; Russian: Сорвать Куш) is a 2006 Czech action adventure video game developed by Centauri Production and published by Playlogic. It is a spin-off to \"Horké léto\". In Russia it was published by Akella.\n\nGraphics were created by Marek Píša. Píša and Viktor Bocan participated in writing the screenplay. Sounds and music were the work of William Foldes. All characters are voiced by comedian Zdeněk Izer, a notable Czech impersonator, besides some female characters. The game has the same humorous style seen across Czech adventures such as Polda. It was the first Czech game with professional dubbing. The game's most famous quote comes in its opening scene: \"I am an ordinary kid. Guys call me Rambo and girls [call me] asshole. Otherwise, I'm Majer. Honza Majer\". Like many other domestic video games of the era, Horke Leto was intended to appeal directly to Czech and Slovak players. The game became a phenomenon upon its release and it immediately ranked among the best Czech adventures ever. Petr Ticháček wrote for BonusWeb in 2003 that the fan base of the game had heavily diminished.\n\nAccording to Miroslav Mrňa, the idea of a sequel was brought up by JRC, then an exclusive distributor for the first game; the developers found this proposition interesting so pursued it. Developments began in late December 1998. The team consisted of one scriptwriter, two programmers, three graphic artists and two musicians. Mrna described the development and production process of the game in detail for iDNES.cz. For Horke Leto 2, a watercolour-style design was made for the backgrounds, which were painted by hand then scanned into the computer. They were inspired by designs from painter Jan Štěpánek. By mid-November, the game was expected to be released in time for the Christmas season. The game would be released at the same time as Polda 2, and there was a friendly rivalry between the two titles. Horke Leto 2 caught the attention of Bonusweb during development, who devoted a considerable amount of airtime to the game, including a series of news articles where they observed the game's development, to a preview and review, a tutorial, an interview with project lead Miroslav Mrňa, and finally a demo. IDEA Games completed a conversion of the game for iOS and Android platforms in 2012; players should access a 30 minute episode before having to pay to complete the rest of the adventure. The game was re-released with updated graphics. \n\nWhile developers from Centauri Production wanted to make a second sequel to the game, they were unable to obtain the rights to the name \"Horke Leto\" or the main character Honza, however the title was still designed as a spiritual sequel. Its original title was meant to be Raiders of the Lost Casino, but this was only used for international distribution purposes. It was announced in May 2005 for release in the third quarter of that year. The game's original title was \"Raiders of the Lost Casino\", a reference to the Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark. the game's visual style is both cartoon-like and gritty. The game was originally supposed to be released in the first few weeks of 2006. This was later pushed to February of that year. Akella demonstrated the game as a work-in-progress at E3 2006. Akella planned an English release for the end of 2006. A French localisation would later be made.\n\nIn \"Horké léto\", the player takes control of teenager Honza Majer, who must rescue his family after they were captured by cannibals. In \"Horké léto 2\", Honza Majer must retrieve the Purple Salamander artefact from the bandit One-Eye Dingo. \"Žhavé léto 3 ½\" sees the player take control of Honza's grandfather, the hapless protagonist Johnny Majer, in the 1920s as he verses the Mafia in the age of the prohibition. Set in the gangster age of the 1930s, the player takes control of the handsome street rat Johnny who inherits a casino, only to discover that there is a plot to expropriate it.\n\nThe first two games are point and click adventures controlled by the mouse. The third is mainly a point and click adventure with elements of stealth, fighting, driving, and shoot ‘em up.\n\nRefresher.cz deemed it an average game, but noted that it didn't stop it from becoming a domestic hit. Doupe.cz wrote the game is one of the best Czech adventures that every player should play. Excalibur suggests that while the graphics and gameplay were nothing special, it was the dubbing into local languages that captured the imagination of Czecheslovakia. PC Tuning deemed it one of the 10 best Czech games of all time. Refresher thought it was the 20th best Czech title, praising its funny dialogues and first-class dubbing.\n\nUpon a preview, Bonusweb hoped that the game's humour would outweigh its average graphics and animations making it an above-average Czech title. Bonusweb.cz compared the title to Polda 2, and ultimately decided that despite its limitations it was worth a play.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics who enjoyed the game's artistic style and story but disliked its gameplay and interface. Hexus disliked the clunky interface, though praised the graphics. Adventure Classic Gaming felt the game was a disappointing attempt to recapture the classic point and click adventures of the late 20th century. Adventures Planet noted the strange mix of genres, that saw arcade-style gameplay be followed by Myst-style puzzles. Bonusweb felt that despite the game's limitations, it was genuinely surprising. Game Watcher deemed the title \"pretty poor\". Game Slave thought \"John\" was a great idea that was poorly executed. 4 Players felt a lot of the humour fell flat. Jeux Video offered a funny and endearing experience. Adventure Treff felt the game was more likely to induce annoyance than fun. PC Guru thought the game was fun despite its graphics. Bonusweb compared the game favorably to Polda 5. Tiscalo felt the game's screenshots were reminiscent of Full Throttle.\n"}
{"id": "25448337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25448337", "title": "Late-night talk show", "text": "Late-night talk show\n\nA late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the United States, where the format originated. It is generally structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist.\n\nLate-night talk shows are a popular format in the United States, but are not as prominent in other parts of the world. Shows that loosely resemble the format air in other countries, but generally air weekly as opposed to the nightly airings of those in the United States. They also generally air in time slots considered to be prime time in the United States.\n\nLate-night talk shows had their genesis in early variety shows, a format that migrated to television from radio, where it had been the dominant form of light entertainment during most of the old-time radio era. \"The Pepsodent Show\", which opened each weekly episode with host Bob Hope's rapid-fire, topical and often political observational comedy, was a particularly important predecessor to the late-night format.\n\nEarly television variety shows included \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (originally known as \"Toast of the Town\"), which aired on CBS Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971 and was hosted by Ed Sullivan, and \"Texaco Star Theater\" with Milton Berle, which aired on NBC from 1948 to 1956. These shows aired once a week in evening time slots that would come to be known as prime time.\n\nThe first show to air in a late night time slot itself, \"Broadway Open House\", aired on NBC in 1950 and ended a year later after host Jerry Lester left the show, infuriated at being upstaged by his sidekick Virginia \"Dagmar\" Lewis. (As it was, there were also not yet enough television sets in the United States to make television broadcasting in late-night viable; Lester himself was a last-minute replacement host for up-and-coming 26-year-old comic Don Hornsby, who caught polio and died less than a week before the show began.)\n\nThe first version of \"The Tonight Show\", \"Tonight Starring Steve Allen\", debuted in 1954 on NBC. The show created many modern talk show staples including an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, comedy bits, and musical performances. By this point, the Federal Communications Commission had lifted a freeze on new television stations, which allowed new stations to pop up across the country, and television adoption soon grew exponentially. As a result, unlike \"Broadway Open House\", \"Tonight\" proved to be a resounding success.\n\nThe success of the show led Allen to get another show, entitled \"The Steve Allen Show\", which would compete with \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on Sunday nights. Meanwhile, hosting duties of \"The Tonight Show\" were split between Allen and Ernie Kovacs; Kovacs had defected to NBC from his own late-night show on the then-crumbling DuMont Television Network. Both Allen and Kovacs departed from \"Tonight\" in 1957 in order to focus on Allen's Sunday night show. After the two left, the format changed similar to that of \"Today\" and was renamed \"Tonight! America After Dark\" and was hosted first by Jack Lescoulie and then by Al Collins while interviews were performed by Hy Gardner, and a house band led by Lou Stein. The show was not popular leading to many NBC affiliates dropping the show. The show returned to the original format that year and was renamed \"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\", with Jack Paar assuming hosting duties.\n\nThe even greater success of the show during Paar's hosting resulted in many NBC affiliates re-airing the show. He was noted for his conversational style, relatively highbrow interview guests, feuds with other media personalities (his feuds with print journalists Ed Sullivan and Walter Winchell marked a power shift from print to television; Winchell's career never recovered from the damage), and mercurial personality; Paar famously quit the show in 1960 in a dispute over a censored joke but was allowed to come back a month later. Paar permanently left the show in 1962, citing the reason that he could not handle the work load of \"The Tonight Show\" (at the time, the show ran 105 minutes a day, five days a week), and he moved to his own weekly prime-time show, which would run until 1965.\n\nAfter Paar's departure, hosting duties were filled by Groucho Marx, Mort Sahl and many others. Johnny Carson took over as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in 1962 and the show was renamed \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". Carson streamlined the format of the show, focusing more on entertainment personalities, tweaking the monologue to include more shorter jokes, and emphasizing sketch comedy. Ed McMahon served as Carson's announcer while from 1962 to 1966 the band was led by Skitch Henderson, who hired, among others, Doc Severinsen. When Henderson left, Milton DeLugg took over. Severinsen took over in 1967, and served as bandleader with the NBC Orchestra. The show originated from NBC Studios in New York City but, as part of Carson's shifting the show toward a more entertainment-oriented program, moved to Burbank, California in 1972.\n\nNBC's two other rivals during the early television era, CBS and ABC, did not attempt any major forays into late-night television until the 1960s. ABC's first effort at late-night TV was hosted by Les Crane, which pioneered the controversial tabloid talk show format that would not become popular until two decades later. Crane's show lasted only six months. Shorter still was \"The Las Vegas Show\", a Las Vegas-based late-night show hosted by Bill Dana that was the only offering of the United Network that ever made it to air (because that network only had a handful of affiliates, it also syndicated to CBS, ABC and independent stations); it, along with the network, only lasted five weeks in summer 1967. Steve Allen himself returned to late-night in syndication twice in this time frame, first with a show that ran from 1962 to 1964 and then with a series that ran from 1968 to 1971. ABC added the \"Joey Bishop\" Show to its late night lineup in 1967, employing a talk show format, in an attempt to rival the Tonight Show, which lasted until 1969. CBS went without late-night TV until 1969, when it acquired \"The Merv Griffin Show\" from syndication; Griffin returned to syndication in 1972, and CBS would not air any further late-night talk shows until 1989, instead opting for reruns, lifestyle programs and imported Canadian dramas in the time slot. By the 1960s, NBC had already cornered the market for late-night television viewing and would go on to dominate the ratings for several decades.\n\nA nationwide prohibition on tobacco advertising that took effect in 1971 prompted NBC to extend its broadcast day by an additional hour with programming it hoped would recuperate some of that lost revenue. In 1973, NBC launched two new programs: a concert series \"The Midnight Special\" that aired Friday nights, and a low-cost talk show, \"The Tomorrow Show\" hosted by Tom Snyder, that aired Mondays through Thursdays. Both shows aired immediately following Carson's \"Tonight Show\" at 1:00 a.m. ET. \"Tomorrow\" was different from \"The Tonight Show\". For instance, the show featured no studio audience, while Snyder would conduct one-on-one interviews (Snyder's guest list was often more eclectic and would sometimes include the intellectuals that Carson had long since abandoned) with a cigarette in hand. Carson's new contract in 1980 allowed him to cut the length of his show from 90 minutes to 60 minutes, and for a short time, \"Tomorrow\" was moved to an earlier timeslot. NBC felt that Snyder's more conversational style would not bring in enough viewership in the earlier time slot, forcibly changed the show's format to resemble Carson's, and added gossip reporter Rona Barrett as a co-host. The two did not get along and had an acrimonious relationship on and off the air. The agreement gave Carson's production company ownership of the timeslot following \"Tonight\", which, a year later, Carson Productions and NBC used to create \"Late Night with David Letterman\". When NBC offered Snyder the time slot after Letterman, he refused it, having always been resentful of the forced change in format, and \"NBC News Overnight\", a newscast, took the slot instead.\n\nDuring his tenure as host of \"The Tonight Show\", Carson became known as \"The King of Late Night\". While numerous hosts (Merv Griffin and Dick Cavett being the best-known) attempted to compete with Carson, none was ever successful in drawing more viewers than Carson did on \"Tonight\", not even ABC's short-lived revival of Paar's show in 1973 using the name \"Jack Paar Tonite\". Much like Paar, Carson became tired of fulfilling the workload of 525 minutes a week, so as local newscasts expanded, \"The Tonight Show\" was shortened to 90 minutes and again to 60 minutes in 1980 with 15 weeks of vacation a year. Because of a lack of competition, Carson was free to take time off (Carson, by 1980, was only hosting three new shows a week) and invite guest hosts to host the show on a weekly basis, and for weeks at a time when Carson was on vacation including Joey Bishop, Joan Rivers, David Letterman, Bob Newhart, Don Rickles, David Brenner and Jerry Lewis.\n\nIn his final years, Carson produced new shows only three nights a week with guest hosts and \"Best of Carson\" reruns the other two nights. From 1983 to 1986, Rivers and Brenner served as Carson's permanent guest hosts. Many in 1986, including top executives at NBC, thought it was possible that Johnny Carson would retire after reaching his 25th anniversary on October 1, 1987, as it was such a logical cut-off point. In the spring of 1986, a confidential memo between top NBC executives listing about ten possible replacements in the event of Carson's retirement the next year was leaked. When Rivers saw it, she was shocked to see that she was nowhere on the list despite the fact that she had been \"The Tonight Show\"'s permanent guest host since 1983. In 1986, Joan Rivers joined the brand new Fox network, where she would host her own late night talk show, \"The Late Show\" which competed directly against \"The Tonight Show\". Clint Holmes served as Rivers' announcer while Mark Hudson served as bandleader. Carson was incensed that Rivers did not consult him beforehand and never spoke to Rivers again.\n\nBrenner also left \"Tonight\" in 1986, although he did so amicably, to launch a syndicated 30 minute late night talk show called \"Nightlife\" which was cancelled after one season.\n\nGarry Shandling, who had been a frequent guest host in the early 80's, served as permanent guest host, alternating with Jay Leno, from 1986 to 1987 when he left to focus on his cable show leaving Leno to be Carson's sole guest host.\n\nCarson did not retire in 1987, instead continuing as host until 1992 with Leno as sole permanent guest host. Rivers was fired from \"The Late Show\" in 1987 after abysmal ratings and a battle with network executives, leading to her being replaced by Arsenio Hall. Hall performed extremely well in the 18–49 demographic, however Fox had already greenlit \"The Wilton North Report\" to replace \"The Late Show\", leading to Hall hosting his own late night talk show in syndication after \"The Late Show\" was cancelled in 1988. \"The Late Show\" continued with many unknown hosts until its cancellation. Hall's syndicated show, \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", began in syndication in 1988, becoming more popular among younger viewers than Carson. The last network attempt at a Carson competitor, CBS's \"The Pat Sajak Show\", lasted less than sixteen months, debuting in 1989 and being cancelled in 1990. ABC opted not to compete against Carson with a late night talk show, instead counterprogramming with a successful news magazine entitled \"Nightline\" beginning in 1980.\n\nCarson retired as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in 1992 following his 30th anniversary as host. This garnered major media attention and speculation on who would replace Carson. The two candidates were David Letterman (host of \"Late Night\" since 1982) and Jay Leno (Carson's regular guest host since 1987). Leno was eventually chosen, leading to Letterman leaving the network to launch a directly competitive late-night talk show, the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on CBS in 1993. \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" debuted in 1992. Letterman was replaced by newcomer Conan O'Brien as host of \"Late Night\". Arsenio Hall's show lost numerous affiliates after Letterman's debut and his show was canceled one year later. Fox returned to late night television in September 1993 with \"The Chevy Chase Show\" hosted by \"Saturday Night Live\" alumnus Chevy Chase. However, due to sagging ratings, disastrous reviews and Chase's embitterment at not being allowed to do the show the way he wanted to host it, the show was cancelled the following month. Even MTV entered the late night contest when it debuted \"The Jon Stewart Show\", hosted by Jon Stewart, which ran until 1995. Letterman initially won the late night ratings battle but fell behind Leno in 1995; Leno generally remained in first place until first leaving \"Tonight\" in 2009. To combat NBC's \"Late Night\", David Letterman created \"The Late Late Show\" to follow Letterman at 12:37; the first host was former host of \"The Tomorrow Show\" Tom Snyder, who hosted the show using the same format he had used on \"Tomorrow\" until his departure in 1999. \"The Late Late Show's\" second host, Craig Kilborn, followed a more conventional (albeit low-budget) late-night format; had previously served as host of \"The Daily Show\", a late night satirical news program on Comedy Central, and upon Kilborn's departure, Jon Stewart replaced him on that show. Perhaps one of the most unusual late night hosts to come out of this boom was basketball player and later entrepreneur Magic Johnson, whose syndicated \"The Magic Hour\" was a major flop and effectively ended any future efforts at a syndicated late-night talk show at that point in time.\n\nABC finally re-entered the late night comedy fray in 1997 by installing \"Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher\" (which had aired on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1996) into its lineup after \"Nightline\". Unlike traditional late-night talk shows, \"Politically Incorrect\" was a half-hour in length and (following a brief host monologue) featured a panel of four guests debating topical issues while Maher moderated in a comedic fashion.\n\nMany late-night talk shows went off the air in the days following the September 11 attacks of 2001, while many of their networks aired round-the-clock news coverage. Letterman was the first to return on September 17, addressing the situation in an opening monologue. The show was not presented in its normal jovial manner, and featured Dan Rather, Regis Philbin, and a musical performance from Tori Amos. \"Politically Incorrect\" also resumed on September 17 and immediately drew controversy due to remarks Maher and a guest (Dinesh D'Souza) made concerning the \"coward\" label given to the terrorists by President George W. Bush. \"The Tonight Show\" returned the following night, featuring John McCain and a performance from Crosby, Stills, and Nash.\n\n\"Politically Incorrect\" was canceled due to low ratings in the summer of 2002, after which Maher joined HBO and began hosting the similarly formatted weekly series \"Real Time\". ABC then tapped Comedy Central personality Jimmy Kimmel to host his own late night talk show (in a more traditional format) and named it \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". From its beginning in 2003 until early 2013, the show aired behind \"Nightline\" in ABC's nightly lineup. In early 2013, ABC promoted \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" to the 11:35pm slot, while \"Nightline\" was relegated to 12:35am.\n\nJake Sasseville entered the late night arena after a self-syndication campaign got him clearance on several ABC affiliates by local general managers in 2008. \"The Edge with Jake Sasseville\" aired after \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in markets reaching a total of 35 million homes, despite the network's concerns. The show went off the air in 2010. Another syndicated show that earned significant clearance in the late 2000s was \"Comics Unleashed\", a panel comedy show that lasted only one season but ran in reruns for several years afterward.\n\nScottish native Craig Ferguson succeeded Kilborn as host of \"The Late Late Show\" in 2005, renaming it \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". TBS entered the late night scene in 2009 when it debuted \"Lopez Tonight\", hosted by comedian George Lopez. On September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of \"The Tonight Show\"s debut, NBC announced that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien, in 2009. Leno explained that he did not want to see a repeat of the hard feelings and controversy that occurred when he was given the show over David Letterman following Carson's retirement in 1992. O'Brien's last \"Late Night\" episode was taped on February 20, 2009. Former Saturday Night Live alum Jimmy Fallon took over as host of \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" on March 2, 2009. The Colbert Report that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005, was hosted by Stephen Colbert, one of the regulars on Comedy Central's The Daily Show.\n\nThe popularity of late-night shows in the United States has been cited as a key factor why Americans do not get the requisite seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Since 2015, late-night talk shows have competed for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Talk Series; prior to that, the genre competed against general variety shows for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series.\n\nIt was announced on July 21, 2008 that Jay Leno would host his final episode of \"The Tonight Show\" on May 29, 2009 with Conan O'Brien and James Taylor as his guests. O'Brien took over hosting duties the following Monday, June 1, 2009. On December 9, 2008, it was announced that Jay Leno would be hosting a new nightly prime time show in September 2009, which aired at 10 p.m. ET. \"The Jay Leno Show\" ended after a short run on February 9, 2010, due to low ratings, which, combined with NBC's poor prime-time performance at the time, affected viewership of its lead-out late newscasts on many NBC stations.\n\nOn January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that \"The Jay Leno Show\" would be moved from the 10 p.m. Eastern time slot to 11:35 p.m. and \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" would be moved from 11:35 p.m. to 12:05 a.m. effective March 1, 2010, the first time in its history that the show would begin after midnight. On January 12, 2010, O'Brien publicly announced in an open letter that he intended to leave NBC if they moved \"The Tonight Show\" to anytime after midnight in order to accommodate moving \"The Jay Leno Show\" to 11:35 p.m. ET. He felt it would damage the show's legacy as it always started after the late local news since it began in 1954. After several days of negotiations, O'Brien reached a settlement with NBC that allowed him to leave \"The Tonight Show\" on January 22, 2010, ending his partnership with NBC after 22 years. Leno began his second tenure as host of \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, 2010, after the 2010 Winter Olympics, but only after major controversy. Leno's second \"Tonight\" was taped at NBC's Studio 11 in Burbank, the former home of \"The Jay Leno Show\", with a modified version of that show's set. After leaving NBC, O'Brien began hosting his own late night talk show, \"Conan\", on TBS on November 8, 2010, after his non-compete clause had lapsed.\n\nIn March 2013, news broke that NBC was expected to part ways with Leno for good after his contract expired in 2014, clearing the way for Fallon (whose tenure at \"Late Night\" had found success with a young, culturally savvy audience) to take over \"The Tonight Show\" beginning that year, which also marked the 60th anniversary of the franchise. NBC confirmed the change on April 3, 2013. Under Fallon, the show returned to New York City, where the show originated from its 1954 debut until 1972; NBC no longer owns the former company-owned studios in Burbank where Carson and Leno's programs originated (O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\" taped at nearby Universal Studios). On May 13, 2013, it was announced that Fallon's former \"SNL\" castmate Seth Meyers would take over as host of \"Late Night\" once Fallon took over \"The Tonight Show\". \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" debuted during NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics in Russia on February 17, 2014, while \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" debuted one week later.\n\nDavid Letterman retired in 2015 after his contract with CBS expired; \"Late Show\" bandleader and sidekick Paul Shaffer made public his intent to retire at the end of the previous contract, which ended in 2014, but had also stated he will stay on with the show if asked (and subsequently did so). Letterman was succeeded by Stephen Colbert, who had hosted Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report\" since 2005. Craig Ferguson retired from late night on December 19, 2014; on September 8, 2014, British comedian James Corden was announced as the new host of \"The Late Late Show\" beginning in 2015.\n\nJon Stewart's contract with Comedy Central also expired in 2015, at which point Stewart retired from on-camera work (later moving to Colbert's \"The Late Show\" as executive producer) and Trevor Noah took his place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25152964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25152964", "title": "Magic (illusion)", "text": "Magic (illusion)\n\nMagic, along with its subgenres of, and sometimes referred to as illusion, stage magic or close up magic is a performing art in which audiences are entertained by staged tricks or illusions of seemingly impossible feats using natural means. It is to be distinguished from paranormal magic which, it is claimed, are effects created through supernatural means. It is one of the oldest performing arts in the world.\n\nModern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th century magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, has become a popular theatrical art form. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as Maskelyne and Devant, Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Harry Houdini achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as \"The Golden Age of Magic\". During this period, performance magic became a staple of Broadway theatre, vaudeville, and music halls. Magic retained its popularity in the television age, with magicians such as David Copperfield, Doug Henning, Penn & Teller, and David Blaine transitioning away from traditional venues.\n\nThe term \"magic\" etymologically derives from the Greek word \"mageia\" (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and Persians had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called \"magosh\" in Persian, came to be known as \"magoi\" in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as \"mageia\", and then \"magika\"—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, who had a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.\nPerformances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout history. For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements. The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the Trojan Horse would also have been used for entertainment, or at least for cheating in money games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and cults from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.\n\nOpinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then \"restore\" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.\nOne of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, \"Natural and Unnatural Magic\", which describes and explains old-time tricks. In 1584, Englishman Reginald Scot published \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their \"magic tricks\" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were sleight-of-hand manipulations with rope, paper and coins. At the time, fear and belief in witchcraft was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced. Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of James I in 1603.\n\nDuring the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including \"The Art of Conjuring\" (1614) and \"The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling\" (c. 1675).\nUntil the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of sword swallowing, juggling and fire breathing. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, Isaac Fawkes, who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for King George II. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:\nFrom 1756 to 1781, Jacob Philadelphia performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout Europe and in Russia.\n\nA founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann.\n\nJohn Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as \"The Great Wizard of the North\". His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert showmanship. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in 1845.\nTowards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. The British performer J N Maskelyne and his partner Cooke were established at the Egyptian Hall in London's Piccadilly in 1873 by their manager William Morton, and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often Oriental) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.\nMaskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being levitation.\n\nThe model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was Alexander Herrmann (February 10, 1844 – December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great. Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the \"first-family of magic\".\n\nThe escapologist and magician Harry Houdini took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as escapology. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a Houdini Museum dedicated to him in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Magic Circle was formed in London in 1905 to promote and advance the art of stage magic.\n\nAs a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included Okito, David Devant, Harry Blackstone Sr., Harry Blackstone Jr., Howard Thurston, Theodore Annemann, Cardini, Joseph Dunninger, Dai Vernon, Fred Culpitt, Tommy Wonder, Siegfried & Roy, and Doug Henning. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include David Copperfield, Lance Burton, James Randi, Penn and Teller, David Blaine, Criss Angel, Hans Klok and Derren Brown. Well-known women magicians include Dell O'Dell and Dorothy Dietrich. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production visual effects.\n\nMany of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, \"it's all done with smoke and mirrors\", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous Pepper's Ghost, a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.\n\nMagic is often described according to various specialities or genres.\n\nMagicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider \"penetrations\" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as Guy Hollingworth and Tom Stone have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as Dariel Fitzkee, Harlan Tarbell, S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.\n\n\nMany magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in \"cups and balls\" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.\n\nThe methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.\n\nDedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity, as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art.\nThe teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice. Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets. This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.\n\nFrom the 1584 publication of Reginald Scot's \"Discoverie of Witchcraft\" until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.\n\nPersons interested in learning to perform magic can join magic clubs. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.\n\nThe world's largest magic organization is the International Brotherhood of Magicians; it publishes a monthly journal, \"The Linking Ring\". The oldest organization is the Society of American Magicians, which publishes the monthly magazine \"M-U-M\" and of which Houdini was a member and president for several years. In London, England, there is The Magic Circle, which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers. Davenport's Magic in London's The Strand is the world's oldest family-run magic shop. The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, is home to the Academy of Magical Arts.\n\nTraditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. Stage illusions use large-scale props and even large animals. Platform magic is performed for a medium to large audience. Close-up magic is performed with the audience close to the magician. Escapology involves escapes from confinement or restraints. Pickpocket magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. \nMentalism creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being Penn & Teller. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games.\n\nSome modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term \"magician\" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of \"illusionist\" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer Jamy Ian Swiss makes these points by billing himself as an \"honest liar\". Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist Joseph Dunninger, who states \"For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.\"\n\nThese apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist Uri Geller made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.\n\nLess fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.\n\nFraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in paranormal phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the Spiritualism religious movement as well as public interest in séances, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and telekinetic effects, which they attributed to the actions of ghosts or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist Harry Houdini devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators. Magician James Randi, magic duo Penn & Teller, and the mentalist Derren Brown have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims.\n\nFraudulent faith healers have also been shown to employ sleight of hand to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet \"tumors\" from patients' abdomens.\n\nCon men and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, \"The Expert at the Card Table\" by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as \"Find the Lady\" or \"Three-card Monte\" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge. Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association, which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the Conjuring Arts Research Center, which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.\n\nPerformance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers of the time.\n\nMany books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.\n\nSeveral notable public research collections on magic are the \"WG Alma Conjuring Collection\" at the State Library of Victoria; the \"R. B. Robbins Collection of Stage Magic and Conjuring\" at the State Library of NSW; the \" H. Adrian Smith Collection of Conjuring and Magicana\" at Brown University; and the \"Carl W. Jones Magic Collection, 1870s–1948\" at Princeton University.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Majorettes can also spin knives, fire knives, flags, light-up batons, rifles, maces and fire batons. They do illusions, cartwheels, and flips, and sometimes twirl up to four batons at a time. Majorettes are often confused with cheerleaders; baton twirling, however, is more closely related to rhythmic gymnastics than to cheerleading.\n\nMajorettes performed originally a typical carnival dance originating in the Rhineland, where the young women who perform this dance are called \"Tanzmariechen\" (Dance Marys) in German or \"Dansmarietjes\" in Dutch.\n\nDuring the carnival the normal form of government is parodied. Also the army and the defense forces were traditionally parodied as a way of protesting against the Prussian occupation of the Rhenish area at the time. In Cologne, these imitations arose in particular to make Prussian militarism look ridiculous. And with a joke army that did just about everything, it would make a normal company look ridiculous.\n\nThe tanzmariechen show clear origins in the camp followers in the 18th and 19th century, and have a vibrant and eventful past. Around this time Germany had a very large number of armies, and there would be young women in each regiment, who served during the day as sellers and providers of food and drink and took on household chores like washing clothes. At the same time, many of these women and girls offered themselves as prostitutes, for which they would dress themselves more provocatively, and they would dance for the soldiers.\n\nAround 1800 more regulations began to emerge in the armies. Slowly these were also applied to the camp followers. Increasingly, the camp follower was a woman who was married to a corporal or private, and whose task it was among other things \"to wash the linen\", according to an old army decision.\nThe camp follower became not a typical army prostitute anymore, but also not a proper married women. Besides caring for the soldiers, she could still continue entertaining them in various ways.\n\nIn the carnival mockery both the officers and the camp followers were depicted. The officer by portraying him as an effeminate, wig-wearing, conceited fool, the camp follower as a woman who was military but provocatively costumed, but also clearly recognizable as a man: the Tanzmarie.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the carnival associations found further inspiration in the revue girls that performed in the theater at the time. These were scantily clad young women, accompanied by some military attributes like peak helmets and military backpacks, which showed provocative dances in small groups. The revue girl grew into a nightclub-like star. It can not be denied that the carnival with its Tanzmariechen has popularized and even parodied the sparkling shows that could otherwise be enjoyed only in the major European cities. Young women and girls again took on the role of tanzmariechen instead of men and they performed at the parades during the post-war carnival. A show element was added to carnival, partly because of rapidly evolving ballet education. Majorettes or tanzmariechen began increasingly to act in groups. Some parts of the Prussian military background are sometimes still reflected today in the movements, music or clothing of the majorettes.\n\nThe somewhat slovenly camp follower who accompanied the troops, has evolved into a show dance group, but still inspired by the Prussian army. This metamorphosis went through the intermediate step of the role performed by men as Tanzmarie.\nAlthough the current majorette has her roots in the carnival scene, the associations of majorettes widely break these historical ties, and profile themselves more as a sports or dance club.\n\n\n"}

Narrative poems do not need rhyme. The poems that make up this genre may be short or long, and the story it relates to may be complex. It is normally dramatic, with objectives, diverse and meter. Narrative poems include epics, ballads, idylls, and lays.\n\nSome narrative poetry takes the form of a novel in verse. An example of this is \"The Ring and the Book\" by Robert Browning. In the terms of narrative poetry, a romance is a narrative poem that tells a story of chivalry. Examples include the \"Romance of the Rose\" or Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King\". Although those examples use medieval and Arthurian materials, romances may also tell stories from classical mythology. \n\nShorter narrative poems often similar in style to the short story. Sometimes, these short narratives are collected into interrelated groups, as with Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\". So sagas include both incidental poetry and the biographies of poets. An example is \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" by Robert Service.\n\nThe oral tradition essentially all other modern forms of communication. For thousands of years, people groups accurately passed on their history through the Oral Tradition from generation to generation. As a clear example and the oldest one comes from Ancient India, the Vedic Chant, which is often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence today. In addition, one of the most notable was the ancient Hebrews, people of the Middle East; they were taught and passed on the stories of God in over 115 countries worldwide. The poetry in the Bible is called the Psalms, that capture stories of conquest, failure, confession and more. Some of it is narrative in nature.\n\nHistorically, much of poetry has its source in an oral tradition: in more recent times the Scots and English ballads, the tales of Robin Hood, of Iskandar, and various Baltic and Slavic heroic poems all were originally intended for recitation, rather than reading. In many cultures, there remains a lively tradition of the recitation of traditional tales in verse formativeness. It has been suggested that some of the distinctive features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as metre, alliteration and kennings, at one time served as memory aids that allowed the bards who recited traditional tales to reconstruct them from memory.\n\nA narrative poem usually tells a story using a poetic theme. Epics are very vital to narrative poems, although it is thought those narrative poems were created to explain oral traditions. The focus of narrative poetry is often the pros and cons of life.\n\n"}
{"id": "718763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718763", "title": "Narratology", "text": "Narratology\n\nNarratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these affect our perception. While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted. It is an anglicisation of French \"narratologie\", coined by Tzvetan Todorov (\"Grammaire du Décaméron\", 1969). Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (\"Poetics\") but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian Formalists, particularly Vladimir Propp (\"Morphology of the Folktale\", 1928), and Mikhail Bakhtin's theories of heteroglossia, dialogism, and the chronotope first presented in \"The Dialogic Imagination\" (1975).\n\nThe origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the structuralist quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the grammars used as a basis for parsing sentences in some forms of linguistics. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; Percy Lubbock's work in point of view (\"The Craft of Fiction\", 1921) offers a case in point.\n\nIn 1966 a special issue of the journal \"Communications\" proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a manifesto. It included articles by Barthes, Claude Brémond, Genette, Greimas, Todorov and others, which in turn often referred to the works of Vladimir Propp (1895–1970).\n\nJonathan Culler (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands \nimplicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between \"story,\" a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and \"discourse,\" the discursive presentation or narration of events.'\nThe Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet fabula and sujet. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. \"histoire\"/\"discours\", \"histoire\"/\"récit\", \"story\"/\"plot\". The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology. The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993, Ricoeur, 1984, and Baroni, 2007) have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.\n\nJames Phelan, editor of \"Narrative\" (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With Frederick Luis Aldama, Brian McHale and Robyn Warhol, Phelan directs Project Narrative at The Ohio State University:)\n\nDesignating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term \"narratology\" is most typically applied to literary theory and literary criticism, as well as film theory and (to a lesser extent) film criticism. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include sociolinguistic studies of oral storytelling (William Labov) and in conversation analysis or discourse analysis that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, graphic novels, the infinite canvas, and narrative sculptures linked to topology and graph theory.\nHowever, constituent analysis of a type where narremes are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of linguistics, semiotics, or literary theory.\n\n\n\n"}

The program was slated to premiere on Fox on January 13, 2010, at 9:15 PM Eastern following \"American Idol\" with a special 45-minute episode, with further episodes being 60 minutes. However, the show was postponed on request by its creator and eventually canceled before any episodes aired due to two separate issues related to the show's integrity.\n\nAccording to Fox, child prodigies would answer trivia questions to win money for their families; their parents would be able to appeal to experts for help.\n\nThe show's producers were (in alphabetical order): Noah Bonnett, Mark Burnett, Lauren Franson, Ron Muccianti, Dave Schapiro, Tod Schellinger, John Stevens, Jenny Tyson and Chris Wagner. Music was produced by David Vanacore. The film editors were Robert M. Malachowski Jr. and Hudson Smith. The casting department was Jennifer Cron and Joshua Robinson.\n\nOn January 7, 2010, one week before its scheduled premiere, the show's creator, Mark Burnett, announced that he'd asked Fox to postpone it due to concerns about its integrity. Burnett said that issues with how information was relayed to contestants were serious enough that he felt compelled to reshoot the episodes. Fox supported Burnett's decision, and added that all contestants would keep their winnings.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that some contestants may have known what questions were going to be asked (though not the answers) rather than just the topics to be covered. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Burnett's main concern was that contestants somehow got more information than they should have prior to taping.\n\nBecause of the abrupt pulling of the series, \"American Idol\" aired for 90 minutes that night, with a repeat showing of the \"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\" episode of \"The Simpsons\" following at 9:30 PM.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that a member of the production team gave a prospective contestant and his parents specific answers to at least four questions. If the show were found to be deliberately rigged, it would mark the first known instance of such a deception in America since the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s. Rigging a game show is a felony under the Communications Act of 1934 (), which was added to the law in 1960 in the wake of the scandals.

{"id": "171435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171435", "title": "Plot device", "text": "Plot device\n\nA plot device, or plot mechanism, is any technique in a narrative used to move the plot forward. A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the suspension of disbelief. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.\n\nMany stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the Indiana Jones film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", he is trying to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant; in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", Jones is on a search for the Holy Grail. This plot device is also used in the \"Arabian Nights\" tale of \"The City of Brass,\" in which a group of travelers on an archaeological expedition journeys across the Sahara to find a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn.\n\nSeveral books in the Harry Potter series orient around a certain object. In \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", Harry believes there is a magical stone in Hogwarts with special powers. Lord Voldemort needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.\n\nThe One Ring from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as Nick Lowe puts it: \"Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa.\"\n\nA MacGuffin is a term, popularized by film director Alfred Hitchcock, referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance. Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, \"In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers.\" This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from The Lord of the Rings), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.\n\nMacGuffins are sometimes referred to as \"plot coupons\" (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to \"collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a dénouement\". The term was coined by Nick Lowe.\n\nThe term \"deus ex machina\" is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.\n\nThe Latin phrase \"deus ex machina\" has its origins in the conventions of Greek tragedy, and refers to situations in which a mechane (crane) was used to lower actors playing a god or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.\n\nThe Greek tragedian Euripides is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play \"Alcestis\", the eponymous heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions. In the end, though, Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a \"deus ex machina\" is Gandalf in \"The Hobbit\". With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was Aristotle in his \"Poetics\", where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.\n\nA shoulder angel is a plot device used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see Negative associations of left-handedness in language). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the id, ego and super-ego in Psychoanalysis, with the person in the center of the dispute being the ego between the super-ego Angel and the id Devil.\n\nThe function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in whodunits, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.\n\nA \"plot voucher\", as defined by Nick Lowe, is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.\n\n"}

Writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears created the original series, \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", for Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1969. This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured four teenagers—Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers—and their talking brown Great Dane named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps.\n\nFollowing the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.–produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of \"Scooby-Doo\" feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1975, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", from 1988 until 1991. New \"Scooby-Doo\" series aired as part of Kids' WB on The WB Network and its successor, The CW Network, from 2002 until 2008. \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013, and \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\" aired on Cartoon Network from 2015 to 2018. Repeats of the various \"Scooby-Doo\" series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang in the United States as well as other countries.\n\nIn 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked \"Scooby-Doo\" the fifth greatest TV cartoon.\n\nIn 1968, parent-run organizations, particularly Action for Children's Television (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning cartoons. Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as \"Space Ghost\", \"The Herculoids\" and \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio\", and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups. Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\n\nFred Silverman, executive for daytime programming at CBS, was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was \"The Archie Show\", based on Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book \"Archie\". Also successful were the musical numbers The Archies performed during each program (one of which, \"Sugar, Sugar\", was the most successful \"Billboard\" number-one hit of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular \"I Love a Mystery\" radio serials of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\".\n\nAfter attempting to develop his own version of the show, called \"House of Mystery\", Barbera, who developed and sold Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna produced them, passed the task along to storywriters Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, as well as artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their treatment, based in part on \"The Archie Show\", was titled \"Mysteries Five\" and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along with their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.\n\nDuring the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who was a breeder of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double chin, and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.\n\nRuby and Spears' second pass at the show used \"Dobie Gillis\" as the template for the teenagers rather than \"Archie\". The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W. As their personalities were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became \"Ronnie\" – later renamed \"Fred\" (at Silverman's behest), Kelly became \"Daphne\", Linda \"Velma\", and W.W. \"Shaggy\". The teens were now based on four teenage characters from \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\": Dobie Gillis, Thalia Menninger, Zelda Gilroy and Maynard G. Krebs, respectively.\n\nThe revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title \"Mysteries Five\", decided to call the show \"Who's S-S-Scared?\" Silverman presented \"Who's S-S-Scared?\" to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming 1969–70 season's Saturday morning cartoon block. CBS president Frank Stanton felt that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.\n\nNow without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused upon Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by Frank Sinatra's scat \"doo-be-doo-be-doo\" at the end of his recording of \"Strangers in the Night\" on a flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog \"Scooby-Doo\" and re-rechristen the show \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.\n\nThe first episode of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" \"What a Night for a Knight\" debuted on the CBS network Saturday, September 13, 1969. The original voice cast featured veteran voice actor Don Messick as Scooby-Doo, radio DJ Casey Kasem (later host of radio's syndicated \"American Top 40\") as Shaggy, actor Frank Welker (later a veteran voice actor in his own right) as Fred, actress Nicole Jaffe as Velma, and musician Indira Stefanianna Christopherson as Daphne. Scooby's speech patterns closely resembled an earlier cartoon dog, Astro from \"The Jetsons\" (1962–63), also voiced by Messick. Seventeen episodes of \"Scooby-Doo Where are You!\" were produced in 1969–70. The series theme song was written by David Mook and Ben Raleigh, and performed by Larry Marks.\n\nEach of these episodes features Scooby and the four teenage members of Mystery, Inc.—Fred, Shaggy, Daphne and Velma—arriving at a location in the Mystery Machine, a van painted with psychedelic colors and flower power imagery. Encountering a ghost, monster, or other ostensibly supernatural creature terrorizing the local populace, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the ghost and other paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, and—often with the help of a Rube Goldberg-like trap designed by Fred—they capture the villain and unmask him. Revealed as a flesh and blood crook trying to cover up crimes by using the ghost story and costume, the criminal is arrested and taken to jail, often repeating something nearly identical to \"... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!\"\n\nScheduled opposite another teenage mystery-solving show, ABC's \"The Hardy Boys\", \"Scooby-Doo\" became a ratings success, with Nielsen ratings reporting that as many as 65% of Saturday morning audiences were tuned in to CBS when \"Scooby-Doo\" was being broadcast. The show was renewed for a second season in 1970, for which eight episodes were produced. Seven of the second-season episodes featured chase sequences set to bubblegum pop songs recorded by Austin Roberts, who also re-recorded the theme song for this season. With Stefanianna Christopherson having married and retired from voice acting, Heather North assumed the role of Daphne, and would continue to voice the character until 1997.\n\nThe TV influences of \"I Love a Mystery\" and \"Dobie Gillis\" were apparent in the first episodes. Of the similarities between the \"Scooby-Doo\" teens and the \"Dobie Gillis\" teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same beatnik-style goatee, similar hairstyles, and demeanors. The core premise of \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" was also similar to Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories would often revolve around a mystery which would invariably turn out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to disguise the villain's true intent.\n\nThe role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a Bob Hope-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery. Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably in the character of Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s \"Scooby-Doo\" productions as knowing many forms of karate and having the ability to defend herself, and less of a tendency towards getting kidnapped.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" itself would be an influence on many other Saturday morning cartoons of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its competitors produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including \"Josie and the Pussycats\" (1970–71), \"The Funky Phantom\" (1971–72), \"The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan\" (1972–73), \"Speed Buggy\" (1973–74), \"Goober and the Ghost Chasers\" (1973–74), \"Jabberjaw\" (1976–78), \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\" (1977–80), among others.\n\nIn 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as \"Harlem Globetrotters\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"Speed Buggy\", the comic book characters Batman and Robin (later adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, \"Super Friends\", a year later), and celebrities such as Sandy Duncan, The Addams Family, Cass Elliot, Phyllis Diller, Don Knotts and The Three Stooges. Hanna-Barbera musical director Hoyt Curtin composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme would remain in use for much of \"Scooby-Doo's\" original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the \"New Movies\" format from 1972 to 1974, CBS began airing reruns of the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" series until its option on the series ran out in 1976.\n\nNow president of ABC, Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" to the ABC Saturday morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their 1976–77 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, \"Dynomutt, Dog Wonder\", to create \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour\" (the show became \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show\" when a bonus \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday morning programs, returned the program to its original \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin Scooby-Dum, voiced by Daws Butler, as a recurring character. The voice cast was held over from \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. Pat Stevens took over her role as the voice of Velma.\n\nFor the 1977–78 season, \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show\" became the two-hour programming block \"Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics\" (1977–78) with the addition of \"Laff-a-Lympics\" and \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\". In addition to eight new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the \"All-Star\" block's \"Laff-a-Lympics\" series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in \"Battle of the Network Stars\"-esque parodies of Olympic sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the \"Laff-a-Lympics\" \"Scooby Doobies\" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.\n\n\"Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics\" was retitled \"Scooby's All Stars\" for the 1978–79 season, reduced to 90 minutes when \"Dynomutt\" was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. \"Scooby's All-Stars\" continued broadcasting reruns of \"Scooby-Doo\" from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" aired during a separate half-hour under the \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" banner. After nine weeks, the separate \"Where are You!\" broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the \"Scooby's All-Stars\" block. The 40 total \"Scooby-Doo\" episodes produced from 1976 to 1978 were later packaged together for syndication as \"The Scooby-Doo Show\", under which title they continue to air.\n\nThe \"Scooby-Doo\" characters first appeared outside of their regular Saturday morning format in \"Scooby Goes Hollywood\", an hour-long ABC television special aired in prime time on December 13, 1979. The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as \"Happy Days\", \"Superman: The Movie\", \"Laverne & Shirley\" and \"Charlie's Angels\".\n\nIn 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew Scrappy-Doo was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost \"Scooby-Doo\"s slipping ratings. The 1979–80 episodes, aired under the new title \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. Lennie Weinrib voiced Scrappy in the 1979–80 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter. Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.\n\nAs a result of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's\" success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute \"Scooby and Scrappy\" cartoons, who in previous \"Scooby\" series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now real within the context of the series.\n\nThis version of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of \"The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show\", an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new \"Richie Rich\" cartoon, adapted from the Harvey Comics character. From 1982 to 1983, \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" were part of \"The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour\", a co-production with Ruby-Spears Productions which featured two \"Scooby and Scrappy\" shorts, a \"Scrappy and Yabba-Doo\" short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his Western deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and \"The Puppy's New Adventures\", based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special.\n\nBeginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of \"Scooby-Doo\" were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles \"Scooby-Doo Classics\", \"Scary Scooby Funnies\", \"The Best of Scooby-Doo\", and \"Scooby's Mystery Funhouse\", the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with \"The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show\" in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.\n\nThis version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title \"The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries\". The 1984–85 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.\n\n1985 saw the debut of \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\", which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by Susan Blu) and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by Vincent Price) traveling the globe to capture \"thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth.\" The final first-run episode of \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\" aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new \"Scooby\" series aired on the network for the next two years.\n\nHanna-Barbera reincarnated the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" cast as elementary school students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", which debuted on ABC in 1988. \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original \"Scooby\" series for a more \"Looney Tunes\"-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \"Scoobert\". At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s. The series also established \"Coolsville\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later \"Scooby\" productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\n\n\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" was developed and produced by Tom Ruegger, who had been the head story editor on \"Scooby-Doo\" since 1983. Following the first season of \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to Warner Bros. Animation to develop \"Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures\" and later \"Animaniacs\", \"Pinky and the Brain\", and \"Freakazoid!\".\n\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced \"Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10\", a series of syndicated TV movies featuring their most popular characters, including Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, The Flintstones and The Jetsons. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers\" (1987), \"Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School\" (1988), and \"Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf\" (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie \"Arabian Nights\", originally broadcast by TBS in 1994, Don Messick's final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.\n\nReruns of \"Scooby-Doo\" have been in syndication since 1980, and have also been shown on cable television networks such as TBS Superstation (until 1989) and USA Network (as part of the USA Cartoon Express from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT. Canadian network Teletoon began airing \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" in 1997, with the other \"Scooby\" series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, \"Scooby-Doo\" became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.\n\nWith \"Scooby-Doo's\" restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Hanna-Barbera (by then a subsidiary of Warner Bros. following the merger of Time Warner and Turner Entertainment in 1996) began producing one new \"Scooby-Doo\" direct-to-video movie a year beginning in 1998. These movies featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" days. The first four DTV entries were \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\" (1998), \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost\" (1999), \"Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders\" (2000), and \"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\" (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 Burger King commercial. Therefore, Scott Innes took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy (Billy West voiced Shaggy in \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\"). B.J. Ward took over as Velma, and Mary Kay Bergman voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by Grey DeLisle.\n\nThese first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\", featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting voodoo-worshiping cat creatures in the Louisiana bayou. \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost\" featured an author (voice of Tim Curry) returning to his hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. \"The Witch's Ghost\" introduced a goth rock band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\" was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company Warner Bros. Animation following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation would continue production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new \"Scooby-Doo\" series for television.\n\nThe direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year. Two of these entries, \"Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire\" and \"Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico\" (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\", using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature Matthew Lillard as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical \"Scooby-Doo\" films. Two Scooby-Doo! movies were released in 2016, named \"Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood\" and \"\".\n\nIn addition, a live-action TV movie, \"Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins\", was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut. The film starred Nick Palatas as Shaggy, Robbie Amell as Fred, Kate Melton as Daphne, Hayley Kiyoko as Velma, and Frank Welker as the voice of Scooby-Doo. A second live-action TV movie, \"Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster\", retained the same cast and aired on October 16, 2010 and a direct-to-video spin-off \"Daphne & Velma\" in 2018. The three films serve as prequels taking place before the events of the 2002 film.\n\nA feature-length live-action film version of \"Scooby-Doo\" was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 14, 2002. Directed by Raja Gosnell, the film starred Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Scooby-Doo, voiced by Neil Fanning, was created on-screen by computer-generated special effects. \"Scooby-Doo\" was a financially successful release, with a domestic box office gross of over US$130 million.\n\nA sequel, \"\", followed in March 2004 with the same cast and director. \"Scooby-Doo 2\" earned US$84 (€55,98) million at the U.S. box office. A third film was planned, but later scrapped following Warner Bros.' disappointment at the returns from \"Scooby-Doo 2\".\n\nAs of 2013, Warner Bros. Pictures was developing a fully animated Scooby-Doo feature film with Atlas Entertainment. Charles Roven and Richard Suckle, who produced the first two live-action films, were producing the animated film, and Matt Lieberman was writing the film.\n\nAs of 2014, Warner Bros. was restarting the film series with Randall Green writing a new movie.\n\nAs of 2015, Warner Bros. had Tony Cervone directing an animated film, with Allison Abbate as producer and Dan Povenmire as executive producer. Originally planned for a September 21, 2018 release, it was later pushed back to May 15, 2020, with Dax Shepard co-directing and co-writing. The film, titled \"S.C.O.O.B.\", is intended as the first film in a \"Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe\".\n\nIn 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, \"Scooby-Doo\" returned to Saturday morning for the first time in 17 years with \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\", which aired on Kids' WB from 2002 until 2006. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.\n\nBeginning with this series, Frank Welker took over as Scooby's voice actor, while continuing to provide the voice of Fred as well. Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, on the condition that the character be depicted as a vegetarian like Kasem himself. Grey DeLisle continued to voice Daphne, and former \"Facts of Life\" star Mindy Cohn voiced Velma. The series was produced by Chuck Sheetz, who had worked on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nAfter three seasons, \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\" was replaced in September 2006 with \"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\", a major revamping of the series which debuted on The CW's Kids' WB Saturday morning programming block. In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by \"Dr. Phibes\" (based primarily upon Dr. Evil from the \"Austin Powers \"series, and named after Vincent Price's character from \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\"), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. \"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\" ran for two seasons on The CW.\n\nThe next \"Scooby\" series, \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\", premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010. The first \"Scooby\" series produced for cable television, \"Mystery Incorporated\" is a reboot of the franchise, re-establishing the characters' relationships, personalities, and locations, and expanding their world to feature their parents, high school, and neighbors. The series also borrowed pieces from many parts of \"Scooby-Doo's\" long history, as well as characters and elements of other Hanna-Barbera shows to form its back story and the bases of some of its episodes. Matthew Lillard was brought over from the direct-to-video series as the new voice of Shaggy, while Welker, Cohn, and DeLisle continued in their respective roles. Patrick Warburton, Linda Cardellini, Lewis Black, Vivica A. Fox, Gary Cole, Udo Kier, Tim Matheson, Tia Carrere, and Kate Higgins were added as new semi-regular cast members. Casey Kasem appeared in a recurring role as Shaggy's father, one of his last roles before retiring due to declining health.\n\nThe series, while still following the basic mystery-solving format of its predecessors, was broadcast as a 52-chapter animated televised novel and included elements similar to live-action mystery/adventure shows such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Lost.\" An overarching mystery surrounding the gang's hometown of Crystal Cove, California became the series' main story arc, with pieces to the mystery unfolding episode by episode. Also featured were romantic entanglements and interpersonal conflict between the lead characters. The series ran for 52 episodes over two seasons, with a three-part finale airing across April 4 and 5, 2013 – exactly three years from the debut.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, Cartoon Network announced several new series based on classic cartoons, including a new Scooby-Doo animated series titled \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\". The show features the gang \"living it up\" the summer after the gang's senior year of high school. Along the way, they run into monsters and mayhem. The series premiered October 5, 2015 on Cartoon Network and concluded on March 18, 2018.\n\nOn May 23, 2018, Boomerang announced that a new Scooby-Doo series titled \"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\" is scheduled to be released sometime in 2019. The series is currently slated to air on the Boomerang streaming service and app. The series will feature the Mystery Inc. gang teaming up with a variety of guest stars to solve mysteries. Confirmed guest stars include Halsey, Sia, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Mark Hamill, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ricky Gervais, Kenan Thompson and Chris Paul. The series will also include fictional guest stars, including Jaleel White as Steve Urkel, Kevin Conroy as Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Warner Bros. Animation began producing direct-to-video special episodes in the style of the concurrently produced films for inclusion on \"Scooby-Doo\" compilation DVD sets otherwise including episodes from previous Scooby series. These include \"Scooby-Doo! Spooky Games\", included on the July 2012 release \"Scooby-Doo! Laff-A-Lympics: Spooky Games\", \"Scooby-Doo! Haunted Holidays\", from the October 2012 release \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Holiday Chills and Thrills\", and \"Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Scarecrow\" and \"Scooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace\", from the September 2013 DVD releases \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Run for Your 'Rife!\" and \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Ruh-Roh Robot!\". On May 13, 2014, another episode, \"Scooby-Doo! Ghastly Goals\" was released on the \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Field of Screams\" DVD. On May 5, 2015, \"Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie\", the sixth direct-to-video special, was released on the \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Surf's Up Scooby-Doo\" DVD.\n\n\nGold Key Comics began publication of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" comic books in December 1969. The comics initially contained adaptations of episodes of the television show drawn by Phil DeLara, Jack Manning and Warren Tufts. The comic books later moved to all-original stories until ending with issue #30 in 1974. Several of these issues were written by Mark Evanier and drawn by Dan Spiegle. Charlton published \"Scooby\" comics, many drawn by Bill Williams, for 11 issues in 1975. From 1977 to 1979, Marvel Comics published nine issues of \"Scooby-Doo\", all written by Evanier and drawn by Spiegel. Harvey Comics published reprints of the Charlton comics, as well as a handful of special issues, between 1993 and 1994.\n\nIn 1995, Archie Comics began publishing a monthly \"Scooby-Doo\" comic book, the first year of which featured Scrappy-Doo among its cast. Evanier and Spiegel worked on three issues of the series, which ended after 21 issues in 1997 when Warner Bros.' DC Comics acquired the rights to publish comics based on Hanna-Barbera characters. DC's \"Scooby-Doo\" series continues publication to this day. In 2013, DC began a digital bi-monthly comic book titled \"Scooby-Doo Team-Up\", crossing over Mystery Inc. with other DC and Hanna-Barbera characters. Since then, the series has become a monthly comic book available in print.\n\nIn 2004, a limited series of a 100 comic books called \"Scooby-Doo! World of Mystery\" was released. In each issue, Mystery Inc. go from country to country solving mysteries. Each issue came with a pack of exclusive cards, with 350 in total able to be collected.\n\nIn 2016, DC launched a new monthly comic book entitled \"Scooby Apocalypse\", with the characters being reinvented in a story set in a post-apocalyptic world, where monsters roam the streets and Scooby and the gang must find a way to survive at all costs, while also trying to find a way to reverse the apocalypse.\n\nEarly \"Scooby-Doo\" merchandise included a 1973 Milton Bradley board game, decorated lunch boxes, iron-on transfers, coloring books, story books, records, underwear, and other such goods. When Scrappy-Doo was introduced to the series in 1979, he, Scooby, and Shaggy became the foci of much of the merchandising, including a 1983 Milton-Bradley \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" board game. The first \"Scooby-Doo\" video game appeared in arcades in 1986, and has been followed by a number of games for both home consoles and personal computers. \"Scooby-Doo \"multivitamins also debuted at this time, and have been manufactured by Bayer since 2001.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" merchandising tapered off during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but increased after the series' revival on Cartoon Network in 1995. Today, all manner of \"Scooby-Doo\"-branded products are available for purchase, including \"Scooby-Doo\" breakfast cereal, plush toys, action figures, car decorations, and much more. Real \"Scooby Snacks\" dog treats are produced by Del Monte Pet Products. Hasbro has created a number of \"Scooby\" board games, including a \"Scooby\"-themed edition of the popular mystery board game \"Clue\". In 2007, the Pressman Toy Corporation released the board game \"Scooby-Doo! Haunted House\". Beginning in 2001, a \"Scooby-Doo\" children's book series was authorized and published by Scholastic. These books, written by Suzanne Weyn, include original stories and adaptations of \"Scooby\" theatrical and direct-to-video features.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2002, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo appeared as characters in the \"Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida. The ride was replaced in the early 2000s with a \"Jimmy Neutron\" attraction, and \"The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" instead became an attraction at several properties operated by Paramount Parks. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are currently costumed characters at Universal Studios Florida, and can be seen driving the Mystery Machine around the park.\n\nIn 2001, \"Scooby-Doo in Stagefright\", a live stage play based upon the series, began touring across the world. A follow-up, \"Scooby-Doo and the Pirate Ghost\", followed in 2009.\n\nThe Mystery Machine has been used as the basis for many die-cast models and toys, such as from hotwheels.\n\nBy 2004, the various \"Scooby-Doo\" merchandise had generated over in profit for Warner Bros. Licensed merchandise also sold in 2015, in 2016, and in 2017.\n\nDuring its four decade broadcast history, \"Scooby-Doo\" has received two Emmy nominations: a 1989 Daytime Emmy nomination for \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", and a 2003 Daytime Emmy nomination for \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\"s Mindy Cohn in the \"Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program\" category. Science advocate Carl Sagan favorably compared the predominantly skeptic oriented formula to that of most television dealing with paranormal themes, and considered that an adult analogue to \"Scooby-Doo\" would be a great public service.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" has maintained a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults who grew up with the series. Several television critics have stated that the show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres was the reason for its widespread success. As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, \"Scooby-Doo\"s ghosts, monsters and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children. \"Overall, [\"Scooby-Doo\" is] just not a show that is going to overstimulate kids' emotions and tensions,\" offered American Center for Children and Media executive director David Kleeman in a 2002 interview. \"It creates just enough fun to make it fun without getting them worried or giving them nightmares.\n\nOlder teenagers and adults have admitted to enjoying \"Scooby-Doo\" because of presumed subversive themes which involve theories of drug use and sexuality, in particular that Shaggy is assumed to be a user of cannabis and Velma is assumed to be a lesbian. Such themes were pervasive enough in popular culture to find their way into Warner Bros.' initial \"Scooby-Doo\" feature film in 2002, though several of the scenes were edited before release to secure a family-friendly \"PG\" rating. Series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears reported that they \"took umbrage\" to the inclusion of such themes in the \"Scooby-Doo\" feature and other places, and denied intending their characters to be drug users in any way.\n\nLike many Hanna-Barbera shows, the early \"Scooby-Doo\" series have been criticized at times for their production values and storytelling. In 2002, Jamie Malanowski of the \"New York Times\" commented that \"[\"Scooby-Doo\"s] mysteries are not very mysterious, and the humor is hardly humorous. As for the animation—well, the drawings on your refrigerator may give it competition.\"\n\nBy the 2000s, \"Scooby-Doo\" had received recognition for its popularity by placing in a number of top cartoon or top cartoon character polls. The August 3, 2002, issue of \"TV Guide\" featured its list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time, in which Scooby-Doo placed twenty-second. Scooby also ranked thirteenth in Animal Planet's list of the 50 Greatest TV Animals. For one year from 2004 to 2005, \"Scooby-Doo\" held the Guinness World Record for having the most episodes of any animated television series ever produced, a record previously held by and later returned to \"The Simpsons\". \"Scooby-Doo\" was published as holding this record in the 2006 edition of the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\n\nIn January 2009, entertainment website IGN named \"Scooby-Doo\" #24 on its list of the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.\n\nAs with most popular franchises, \"Scooby-Doo\" has been parodied and has done parodies.\n\n\n"}

The script coordinator is responsible for producing each draft of the script and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.\n\nOn a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and production departments. The writers deliver the first draft of a script to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the script for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. \n\nThe script coordinator must check the draft for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the draft. Once a script has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the script. The process of how widely each draft is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. \n\nWith each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the script and again check the script for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a show bible that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. \n\nA script coordinator is a distinct role from script supervisor. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the script for editing purposes rather than pre-production coordination of the script to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time screenwriter is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.\n"}
{"id": "26318952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26318952", "title": "Soft media", "text": "Soft media\n\nSoft media is defined as those organizations that primarily deal with commentary, entertainment, arts and lifestyle. Soft media can take the form of television programs, magazines or print articles. The communication from soft media sources has been referred to as soft news.\n\nSoft news is defined as information that is primarily entertaining or personally useful. Soft news is often compared to hard news, which John Zaller defines as the \"coverage of breaking events involving top leaders, major issues, or significant disruptions in the routines of daily life.\" While the purposes of both hard and soft news include informing the public, the two differ from one another in both the information contained within them and the methods that are used to present that information. Communicated through forms of soft media, soft news is usually contained in outlets that primarily serve as sources of entertainment, such as television programs, magazines, or print articles.\n\nThere are many terms that can be associated with soft media, among them are soft news and infotainment. These are, in large part, the byproducts of soft media. A fundamental role of the media, either hard or soft, is to inform the public. While the role of media is not in flux, the form is. For many Americans the lines are becoming blurred between hard and soft media as news organizations are blending their broadcasts with news shows and entertainment. Many of these news organizations create a narrative that begins with the first broadcast in the morning and end with the evening entertainment venue.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential campaign, magazines that would otherwise be considered lifestyle or entertainment (\"Vogue\", \"Ladies Home Journal\" and \"\") became a source of political information. This illustrates that media organizations across the spectrum are emerging as suppliers of information on policy and politics.\n\nThe average American consumes more than five hours of television per day. During this time, they are exposed to a variety of news and information that either directly (hard news) or indirectly (soft news) focuses on politics, foreign affairs, and policy. These topics are aired on prime-time television in a variety of programs especially in a time of national crises. Studies have shown that news presented in this context attracts the attention of otherwise politically uninvolved people. Overall more people tend to watch hard news than soft news shows. However, those who are less politically involved can gain more from watching soft news than those who are highly politically involved.\n\nStudies have also shown that exposure to soft news can affect consumers' attitudes. Soft media has been shown to increase a candidate’s likability, which has a greater appeal to those people who are generally not politically involved than a candidate’s political policies do. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, researchers found politically uninvolved people who viewed candidates on daytime talk shows were likely to find those candidates more likable than their opponents. Studies show that instead of using a candidate's political policy to determine whether or not the candidate represents their interests, non-politically involved people also use a candidate's likability.\n\nA study conducted in Australia concluded hard news is more followed than soft news, except in the realm of sports. The study found that regardless of age and sex, soft news is less likely to be followed than hard news. With the lack in following for soft news, support for increased public engagement caused by soft news is rejected. \n\nIn another study examining the effects of soft news consumption on voting behaviors, the phenomenon known as the Oprah Effect was established, which indicated that the intake of soft news has a positive effect on patterns of voting consistency in people who are otherwise politically unaware. In addition to this, Baum and Jamison's study found that watching interviews of candidates on soft media helps improve voting consistency in otherwise politically uninformed people.\n\n"}
{"id": "592806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=592806", "title": "Sports entertainment", "text": "Sports entertainment\n\nSports entertainment is a type of spectacle which presents an ostensibly competitive event using a high level of theatrical flourish and extravagant presentation, with the purpose of entertaining an audience. Unlike typical sports and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, physical exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing.\n\nThe term \"sports entertainment\" was coined by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) chairman Vince McMahon during the 1980s as a marketing term to describe the industry of professional wrestling, primarily to potential advertisers, although precursors date back to February 1935, when \"Toronto Star\" sports editor Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as \"sportive entertainment\". In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as \"sports entertainment\" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport.\n\nSome sports entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings.\n\nSome forms of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered minor, such as dodgeball, poker, or rock-paper-scissors, and televising them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) celebrity competitors or elaborate audiovisual packages.\n\nSports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment, and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning.\n\nMany notable names in the United States openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has a reputation as a long time pro wrestling fan and attends WWE events several times per year, and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he retires from professional boxing. Both worked feuds with Big Show, Mayweather's culminating in a featured match at WrestleMania XXIV. Former American football player Brian Urlacher made an attempt to leave football to wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling full-time until his team at the time, the Chicago Bears, forced him to stop. Mixed martial artists Brock Lesnar, Bobby Lashley and Dan Severn have been booked as pro wrestling world heavyweight champions; David Arquette was briefly WCW World Heavyweight Champion, as part of a cross-promotional movie deal.\n\n"}
{"id": "236424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236424", "title": "Street performance", "text": "Street performance\n\nStreet performance or busking is the act of performing in public places for gratuities. In many countries the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to antiquity. People engaging in this practice are called street performers or buskers.\n\nPerformances are anything that people find entertaining. Performers may do acrobatics, animal tricks, balloon twisting, caricatures, clowning, comedy, contortions, escapology, dance, singing, fire skills, flea circus, fortune-telling, juggling, magic, mime, living statue, musical performance, puppeteering, snake charming, storytelling or reciting poetry or prose, street art such as sketching and painting, street theatre, sword swallowing, and ventriloquism.\n\nThe term \"busking\" was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb \"to busk\", from the word \"busker\", comes from the Spanish root word \"buscar\", with the meaning \"to seek\". The Spanish word \"buscar\" in turn evolved from the Indo-European word \"*bhudh-skō\" (\"to win, conquer\"). It was used for many street acts, and title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, \"El Buscón\". Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly relegated for female street sex workers, or women seeking to be set up as private mistress of married men.\n\nThere have been performances in public places for gratuities in every major culture in the world, dating back to antiquity. For many musicians street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of recording and personal electronics. Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the barrel organ, the music box, and the piano roll. Organ grinders were commonly found busking in the old days.\n\nBusking is common among some Romani people. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the Mediterranean coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.\n\nIn medieval France buskers were known by the terms troubadours and \"jongleurs\". In northern France they were known as trouveres. In old German buskers were known as Minnesingers and \"Spielleute\". In obsolete French it evolved to \"busquer\" for \"seek, prowl\" and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia buskers are called skomorokh and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.\n\nMariachis, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.\n\nAround the mid-19th century Japanese \"Chindonya\" started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the Edo period is Nankin Tamasudare, in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.\n\nIn the United States, medicine shows proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling elixirs and potions to improve the health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances they would \"pass the hat\".\n\nOne-man bands have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.\n\nFolk music has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. Two of the more famous folk singers are Woody Guthrie and Joan Baez. The delta bluesmen were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. B.B. King is one famous example who came from these roots.\n\nThe counterculture of the hippies of the 1960s occasionally staged \"be-ins\", which resembled some present-day busker festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The San Francisco Bay Area was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at Golden Gate Park and San Jose's Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish, Moby Grape and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nChristmas caroling can also be a form of busking, as wassailing included singing for alms, wassail or some other form of refreshment such as figgy pudding. In Ireland the traditional Wren Boys and in England Morris Dancing can be considered part of the busking tradition.\n\nIn India and Pakistan's Gujarati region Bhavai is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the barot or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.\n\nIn the 2000s, some performers have begun \"Cyber Busking\". Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or \"stream\" and if people like it they make a donation using PayPal.\n\nThere are three basic forms of street performance\n\n\"Circle shows\" are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with street theatre, puppeteering, magicians, comedians, acrobats, jugglers and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.\n\n\"Walk-by acts\" are typically where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end and the public usually watch for a brief time. A walk by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.\n\n\"Stoplight performers\" present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Central and South America than elsewhere.\n\nBuskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk by acts their instrument case or a special can or box is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show to ensure all audience members have had a chance to show appreciation for their skills. Sometimes a performer will employ a \"bottler\", \"hat man\", or \"pitch man\" to collect money from the audience. The term \"bottler\" is a British term which originated following the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous Punch and Judy troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times. Bottling itself can be an art form, and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch. A good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money. A bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch. Prior to the 20th century, it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler. That practice has diminished or ceased in many countries due to changes in social attitudes and animal control laws. However some modern buskers use a device known as monkey stick which is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached to make a noise before a show or prior to making a collection.\n\nThe place where a performance occurs is called a \"pitch\". A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs and theaters, subways and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any plaza or town square as well as zócalos in Latin America and piazzas in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.\n\nIn her book, \"Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York\", Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage \"Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast\" plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment. Some cities encourage busking in particular areas, giving preference to city government-approved buskers and even publishing schedules of performances.\n\nMany cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in Key West, in New Orleans, in New York around Central Park, Washington Square, and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around Venice Beach, the Santa Monica Third Street Promenade, and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on Maxwell Street, in the Delmar Loop district of St. Louis, and many other locations throughout the US.\nBusking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland, and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.\n\nThe first recorded instances of laws affecting buskers were in ancient Rome in 462 BC. The Law of the Twelve Tables made it a crime to sing about or make parodies of the government or its officials in public places; the penalty was death. Louis the Pious \"excluded \"histriones\" and \"scurrae\", which included all entertainers without noble protection, from the privilege of justice\". In 1530 Henry VIII ordered the licensing of minstrels and players, fortune-tellers, pardoners and fencers, as well as beggars who could not work. If they did not obey they could be whipped on two consecutive days.\n\nIn the United States under constitutional law and most European common law, the protection of artistic free speech extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public parks, streets, sidewalks, thoroughfares and town squares or plazas. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.\n\nWhile there is no universal code of conduct for buskers, there are common law practices which buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding statutory law. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed local councils. Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument. In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license. Oxford City Council have decided to enact a public space protection order. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special permit to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the volume of sound produced. It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that endanger the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that \"performing blue\" (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.\n\nIn London, busking is prohibited in the entire borough of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits in tube stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, Councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.\n\nBuskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as \"dipping\" or \"skimming\". George Burns described his days as a youthful busker this way:\n\n\nOrganisations\n\nPress\n\nOther\n"}
{"id": "911372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911372", "title": "Street theatre", "text": "Street theatre\n\nStreet theatre is a form of theatrical performance and presentation in outdoor public spaces without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including shopping centres, car parks, recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from buskers to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it. Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.\n\nSometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street festivals, children's shows or parades, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.\n\nThe logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple costumes and props, and often there is little or no amplification of sound, with actors depending on their natural vocal and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that physical theatre, including dance, mime and slapstick, is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.\n\nStreet theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or roped off) and a ticketed audience.\n\nIn some cases, street theatre performers have to get a licence or specific permission through local or state governments in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally to certain locations of note.\n\nStreet theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious passion plays and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in variety theatres, music halls and in vaudeville, now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include Robin Williams, David Bowie, Jewel and Harry Anderson.\n\nStreet theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.\n\nPerformance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled \"Our Daily Bread\" that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of Wonder Bread along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.\n\nOther artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.\n\nSome contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as Carnival, commedia dell'arte etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.\n\nWhatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of Welfare State International argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.\nMany companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the guerrilla theatre of San Francisco Mime Troupe, The Living Theatre, the carnivalesque parades of Bread and Puppet Theatre, and the work of Ashesh Malla and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of Nepal.\n\nA character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a \"Candid Camera\" way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.\n\nAnother example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "961949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=961949", "title": "Superstars", "text": "Superstars\n\nSuperstars is an all-around sports competition that pits elite athletes from different sports against one another in a series of athletic events resembling a decathlon. Points are awarded for the position in which the competitor places in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is declared the champion.\n\nOn the original ABC version, an athlete could compete in up to seven events, but no athlete was permitted to compete in the sport(s) of his or her profession. In the World, International, European and British versions of the contest, athletes would compete in 8 out of 10 events, with no one generally allowed to take part in their own sport, although some handicapping rules did apply.\n\nThe idea was developed by 1948 and 1952 Olympic figure skating champion Dick Button. He shopped the idea to all three U.S. television networks, and ABC bought it as a special for the winter of 1973. The first Superstars competition was held in Rotonda West, Florida in March 1973 and was won by pole vaulter Bob Seagren. The BBC covered the competition and aired their own programme, featuring British athletes on 31 December 1973, which was won by 400 metre hurdles Olympic champion David Hemery. Television broadcasts of the competitions were popular both in Europe and North America in the 1970s and 1980s. Further events featuring European athletes started from 1975, with six World Superstars championships taking place from 1977 to 1982.\n\nCompetitors participate in a range of different sporting events, including a 100-yard dash/100m sprint, half mile (800 m) run, obstacle course or steeplechase, weightlifting, soccer skills, rowing, tennis, basketball, bicycle racing, shooting and swimming. The sports have varied over time and between the various national and international competitions; in the first competition there was no obstacle course, but table tennis and baseball hitting were included, while the European versions featured a 600m Steeplechase, indoor cycling on a highly banked velodrome, and the infamous 'Gym Tests'.\n\nCanadian soccer player Brian Budd was unbeaten in Superstars contests, winning the World Championship three times from 1978 to 1980, making him the most successful Superstar of all time.\n\nOriginally aired in the US by ABC in March 1973, Superstars was first broadcast in Britain on 31 December 1973 as \"Britain's Sporting Superstars\", closely following the American format. David Vine, who was the main presenter of the BBC programme from 1973 to 1985, said \"in 1972, Ron Pickering, myself, Don Revie, Billy Bremner and TV producer Barney Colehan sat in a hotel in Leeds and formulated Superstars but the BBC dismissed the idea. Then Dick Button started it in the States and the BBC bought the rights\".\n\nRecorded at Crystal Palace in August and promoted as a challenge between Britain's seven best sportsmen, the contest was won by David Hemery, the 1968 Olympic champion in the 400 metres hurdles, defeating Jackie Stewart, Bobby Moore, Joe Bugner, Roger Taylor, Tony Jacklin and Barry John. Featuring the first ever gym test (devised by Pickering, and comprising circuit running, a medicine ball throw, parallel bar dips and squat thrusts) the event came down to the final steeplechase, where Hemery overcame a 100m handicap to pass Barry John with 60 metres left. Shown on New Year's Eve, the programme was a major success and was repeated the following year.\n\nIn the second event in 1974, World Light-Heavyweight boxing champion John Conteh comfortably beat an ill Hemery and Colin Bell to win the title, again at Crystal Palace. Conteh credited the highly competitive nature of the competition with increasing his abilities as a boxer, the inception of this cross-sport contest quickly encouraged many top athletes to push themselves further, introducing the idea that the winner could claim to be the country's \"top sportsman\" and also provided an arena where recently retired champions (such as Hemery and Lynn Davies) could extend their careers.\n\nFollowing the success of the first two standalone UK competitions, in 1975 the British national Superstars contest was suspended, and the event was widened to include participants from continental Europe. Five preliminary heats were held, followed by a final at the Ahoy indoor arena in Rotterdam, famous for its banked, wooden cycling track. This proved to make Superstars a major hit, achieving large audiences across the continent and paving the way for the International and World Superstars editions to follow.\n\nMemorable events in the first year of European Superstars included Malcolm Macdonald winning the 100m sprint in a Superstars record time of 10.9 seconds (after being made to run the race twice following the false start of another competitor), David Hemery being beaten by Dutch field hockey player Ties Kruize following a fall in the 600m Steeplechase, Swedish Discus thrower Ricky Bruch setting records in the weight lifting and medicine ball throw section of the gym tests and the first appearance of pole vaulter Kjell Isaksson, who dominated the final heat in Sweden, scoring a then record 69 (out of a possible 80) points.\n\nBefore the final in Rotterdam, Kruize was badly injured in a car accident and was replaced by Hemery, who finished second. Kjell Isaksson dominated the event again, winning four of his eight events and finished second or third in three others, winning the title with an event to spare.\n\nThe rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in \"near specialist\" events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery made up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, after again falling badly at the water jump and running the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.\n\nIn 1976 national competitions were resumed and Hemery again became UK Superstar, beating Conteh and Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt easily. By now Hemery was a \"professional Superstar\", competing in Britain, Europe and the US, and devising his own training regime. His performances duly improved, and even though 1976 Olympic Judoka David Starbrook took his parallel bar dips record in the gym tests, Hemery had become Britain's top competitor.\n\nIn the Ahoy final, Isaksson won five events and finished 20 points ahead of his nearest rival. The top eight finishers were also guaranteed a place at the inaugural World Superstars competition, to be held in the US the following year.\n\n1977 provided two new champions, with Isaksson taking part only in the World contest and David Hemery competing in American Superstars. In the UK national Superstars, rower Tim Crooks beat future World's Strongest Man Geoff Capes in a tight contest, but failed to qualify for the European final, losing by one point to François Tracanelli in the Spanish heat. Representing Great Britain instead at the Ahoy final was Rugby League player Keith Fielding, who finished a close second, matching Hemery's best ever performance by a British Superstar.\n\nThe winner of 1977 European Superstars was the returning Ties Kruize, who was now fully recovered from his car crash. With just the indoor steeplechase left, Kruize was one point behind Jean-Paul Coche but five ahead of Fielding. With Coche having completed his events Fielding needed to win the final race, with Kruize finishing no better than third. With Fielding already finished (and celebrating) Kruize passed speed skater Hans van Helden on the final straight to win by 2.5 points. An exhausted Fielding then told BBC TV that the loss was \"a damn, bloody shame\", but both qualified for the 1978 World Championship.\n\nThere was no UK national or European Superstars contest in 1978, but both events returned in 1979, along with a new \"Past Masters\" event for competitors over 35, which was won by Lynn Davies, the 1964 Olympic Long Jump champion. 1979 saw the first appearances of judoka Brian Jacks, who became Britain's most famous Superstar. Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.\n\nNo Briton had ever won this title, but Jacks was a strong favourite against defending champion Ties Kruize. Jacks won the gym tests and set a new record time in the cycling. At start of the final event, the steeplechase, Jacks had a small lead, but was out of events. Kruize accumulated enough points in the steeplechase to join Jacks in a tie for first place. With no tie-breaking system in operation both men were crowned European Superstar, making Jacks the most successful British Superstar ever. Jacks succumbed to shingles in late 1979 so was unable to travel to The Bahamas for the World Championship.\n\nSuperstars regularly attracted over 10 million TV viewers in the UK and Jacks became a household name, appearing on children's TV shows and picking up endorsements usually beyond the reach of a minority sport participant. Superstars also expanded again in 1980, adding International Superstars to its list of programmes, though this was as a direct replacement for the European event. Although popular in the UK, US, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia, Superstars reached its peak at the turn of the decade, and one by one (starting in Europe) the participating nations fell away.\n\nAgainst Jacks in 1980 was Daley Thompson, globally recognised as the top multi-sports athlete after his victory in the 1980 Olympic Games decathlon competition. With Brian Budd in attendance for the UK National final, Brian Jacks took on Thompson, Steve Assinder from Basketball, pentathlete Danny Nightingale and the new \"Past Master\", former 400m hurdler John Sherwood, who won all his events in the heats, setting a new record.\n\nIn the gym tests Jacks scored 80 in the dips and 73 in the squat thrusts, and finished 18 points ahead of Sherwood in second place. Thompson finished third. John Sherwood in finishing in second place gained a place in the World Championships and with it the possibility of big prize money. To ensure that he was able to finish second Sherwood had to turn professional part-way through the competition in order to compete in the 100m (as his status as an amateur track and field athlete would normally have barred him from competing in this event). Although many amateur athletes (most notably Kjell Isaksson) had competed in Superstars since its inception, they had never been able to retain any prize money, with this instead going to their sport. In winning three World Superstar titles, Brian Budd won over $130,000, while Bob Seagren (the first World Champion) won over $200,000.\n\nIn International Superstars in Israel Jacks defeated both of the other European Superstars champions Ties Kruize and Kjell Isaksson, as well as 1980 Tour de France winner Joop Zoetemelk to claim the new title.\n\nFor Sherwood – a PE teacher from Sheffield at this time, and not a full-time sportsman – the World Championship proved to be a success, but not for Jacks, aiming to become the first European to win the title. In The Bahamas both Britons won events: Jacks in the weightlifting and the gym tests—after an epic struggle against Brian Budd—and Sherwood in the cycle race. However, it was Sherwood's two second-places in the football and 800 metres that propelled him into second place, with the cycling coming at Jacks' expense, and winning him $15,000 in the process. He was officially now Britain's best ever Superstar, although he had still finished 26 points behind Budd.\n\nTo start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off \"Challenge of the Champions\" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two \"Past Masters\" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.\n\nThis was arguably the strongest ever UK Superstars contest, and with so many competitive sportsmen present it was no surprise that records tumbled. Jacks was the heavy favourite, and duly won his 'banker' events, but his inability to compete in the running tests left him facing huge obstacles.\nHis performance in the gym tests was simply astonishing, smashing his own parallel bars record in the starkly lit Wycombe sports centre with an awesome 100 in 54 seconds; had he pushed himself all the way to the minute he could easily have added more. His innovative 'rocking' technique (like Budd's sliding squat thrusts) was widely copied, but none of his rivals could get anywhere near him, and though Sherwood again pushed him close in the squats section, in reality Jacks was in a class of one here.\n\nThe key to winning Superstars had become to gain maximum points in your best events and then to place as highly in the others – simple in theory, but appallingly hard in practice. Jacks usually dominated in the gym and weightlifting, and almost always also won the cycling and canoeing. That gave him a nominal 40 point head start on his rivals, but if this sequence could be disrupted, then Jacks was relying on picking up more points elsewhere. He never competed in the two running events and was a weaker shot that his rivals, so he was then faced with winning the basketball or swimming which were much more equal events. And in the Challenge of the Champions Keith Fielding was able to disrupt Jacks' strategy by enough to beat him.\n\nEarly on Jacks was looking good, beating Fielding in a record time to win the canoeing, but once Fielding had won the cycling Jacks was beaten. Fielding had entered the event hoping to take the Superstars 100m record first and foremost, and then to put up a good showing against Jacks. Now he was the ultimate champion.\n\nThe key had been his ability to score well throughout – he was second in the steeplechase for instance – and even losing his 'banker' (the 100m to David Hemery) was not a problem. By winning the steeplechase in the final event, Lynn Davies was able to push Jacks down into third place, and with injuries forcing the judoka to miss the 1981 British final later that season, this would be an ignominious end to his Superstars story. For Fielding, the forgotten man of 1978, this was a new dawn that he followed up by a second convincing win in the UK final.\n\nSince 1978, the BBC had also produced an equally popular British Superteams event, which was dominated from the start by the \"Athletes\" – a team of Track and Field stars, who won every series but the final one in 1985. From 1979 a stand-out performer in this team was Brian Hooper, a pole-vaulter with an immense will to win. He first came to prominence in the 1979 Superteams final, failing to be able to jump onto a balance beam in the obstacle course event, and by 1982 he had blossomed into a fine, all-round performer.\n\nLeading the 1982 Athletes team to Superteams victory, Hooper was trailed by the BBC as the new challenger to watch in that season's UK final. He was a strong swimmer, almost unbeatable in the canoeing and gym tests, and competitive in all his other events. And then he lost in his heat, to Karate fighter Vic Charles, and his promise seemed lost. However, Charles was unable to compete in the 1982 final, and Hooper was his replacement. He would go on to win his next five straight Superstars events, becoming two time British Superstar, three-time International Superstar, and the 1982 World Superstar Champion. Only Brian Budd has a better record in the competition.\n\nHooper's victory in the 1982 World Championship came at the expense of defending World Champion Jody Scheckter, and American Footballers James Lofton, Cris Collinsworth and Mark Gastineau. Hooper later stated that he felt pressured by the aggressive nature of the US challengers, which came to a head in the final of the bike race, where he found himself boxed in by several rivals all seemingly working in concert to hold him back. Charging through powerfully and fairly, Hooper finished comfortably in the lead, but was then faced with official protests, claiming he either took a short-cut off the track or otherwise acted illegally. He clearly had not, and was quickly declared the legitimate winner. Victories in the rowing and second place in the gym test and swimming saw him win by just 3/4 of a point from talented runner Lofton. He was however 10 3/4 points clear entering the final event (and thus guaranteed to win the title) and coasted through his obstacle course heat. As only the two fastest heat winners ran in the final, Hooper could not add to his tally. Lofton on the other hand had $10000 to fight for, and bested Renaldo Nehemiah in the final event, and duly took second place, something again he was virtually guaranteed before the event.\n\nBy now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the kayaking and came second in golf, almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.\n\nThough Brian Hooper continued to compete in (and dominate) Superstars events until he retired in 1984, he stopped competing in the UK national contest after 1983, and he was succeeded as national champion in 1984 by athlete Garry Cook. The 1983 championship was also notable for the record breaking performances of Des Drummond in the 100m, with the agile Leigh Rugby League player managing to lower the mark down to only 10.85 seconds, in itself a time comparable with many full-time track and field athletes who would compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The final also saw Hooper beat Vic Charles (the only man ever to finish above him in any Superstars competition at that point).\n\nIn the 1984 final Garry Cook was pushed very close by professional stunt performer and motorcycle racer, Eddie Kidd, but he held on against a weaker field than usual to become champion. Cook also competed in the now more popular \"Superteams\" series, as part of the never-defeated 'Athletes' team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of 'freshening up' and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include bar jumps and adding computerised scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to Portsmouth and took on a naval theme, adding a field gun competition in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of \"Superteams\" was duly won by 'Watersports' (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer Robin Brew who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the bar jump became his speciality.\n\nContinuing this success, Brew reached the final of the 1985 UK national championship where he narrowly beat a strong field, including Rugby League player Joe Lydon, Olympic silver medallist Judoka Neil Adams and then only a one-time Olympic gold medal winning rower, Steve Redgrave. The RAF officer then completed a successful first year in Superstars by becoming the last ever International champion, this time much more comfortably.\n\nA new period of Superstars dominance could have evolved for Brew, but with the UK version being the only surviving national championship outside the United States, and no prospect of World Superstars being revived, once TWI decided to halt production of International Superstars the BBC version was soon cancelled as well. With viewing figures falling, and potential participants ever more pressurised into not entering by scheduling conflicts and insurance demands the BBC's decision to end the show was neither unexpected or mourned, and although David Vine, Ron Pickering and executive producer Peter Hylton Cleaver did fight to keep the show on air, it was all to no avail.\n\nOver the next fifteen years, though the US version continued unabated, Superstars in the UK existed solely as a nostalgic memory for sporting clip shows, usually focussing on Kevin Keegan falling off his bike, Stan Bowles shooting the table instead of a target, or Brian Jacks eating oranges. During the 1990s BBC programmes (such as \"Fantasy Football League\") regularly made use of this footage – and kept the show in the public spotlight – while Sky Sports began to show full-length programmes on its \"Sky Sports Classic\" channel. This, together with a new generation of television executives and sports presenters who grew up as fans of the show created interest in a revival, which finally happened as part of the 2002 Sport Relief charity event.\n\nIn 2002, the BBC held a one-off, but truncated, UK Championship as a major feature of its biannual Sport Relief charity telethon. Featuring a field including Sir Steve Redgrave, Martin Offiah, John Regis, Austin Healey and Chris Boardman, the event was a first for a British Superstars event in that it featured both non-British competitors (Dwight Yorke and Gianluca Vialli) and also female participants (Alex Coomber and Stephanie Cook). With only seven events (as opposed to the usual eight or ten) and being only part of a larger event instead of being a stand-alone series, the contest was different from those of the earlier era.\n\nWhile the participants were no less able, the event was less 'competitive', with no prize money at stake and no European, World or International contest to qualify for. It was dominated by Healey, who won four of his five events, and came runner-up in the other. Stephanie Cook was the other stand-out performer, finishing joint second with Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman, and finishing runner-up in two events.\n\nThe event was an overwhelming success, and it inspired the BBC to create a new UK Championship series in 2003. Produced by TWI and held in La Manga Club in Spain, this time it was a full event with heats and a final, something that had not been part of the series since 1983.\n\nOn 29 April 2008, it was announced that the show would be returning on Five for the summer of 2008. It was produced by TWI with eight one-hour shows. In a change of format, the competitors were split into four teams, captained by Kelly Holmes, Steve Redgrave, Roger Black and Mike Catt.\n\nFollowing the success of Team GB at the 2012 London Olympics, the BBC revived \"Superstars\" for a single special edition that aired on Saturday 29 December at 6.45pm, comprising a men's and women's UK championship. Presented by Gabby Logan, Iwan Thomas and Denise Lewis, the event was held on 24 & 25 November 2012, at the sports facilities of the University of Bath.\n\nThe show featured Olympic medallists who were coached for swimming by Rebecca Adlington, and the competitors were: Alistair Brownlee, Jonathan Brownlee, Mo Farah, Robbie Grabarz, Michael Jamieson, Anthony Joshua, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Peter Wilson, Nicola Adams, Lizzie Armitstead, Laura Bechtolsheimer, Gemma Gibbons, Helen Glover, Katherine Grainger, Jade Jones, Christine Ohuruogu.\n\nThe Men's Championship was won comfortably by Olympic Super-heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, while the Women's Championship was won even more convincingly by women's coxless pair Olympic champion Helen Glover. Joshua won with an event to spare, while Glover won her final event (the Gym Tests) to win the Women's Superstars title by 14 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Superstars\" was first broadcast by ABC Sports as a two-hour special in 1973. Bob Seagren, an Olympic pole vault gold medalist, was the first winner. However, it was heavyweight champion boxer Joe Frazier who nearly stole the show. In the very first event, the 50 meter swimming heats, Frazier nearly drowned, and only after he was retrieved from the pool did he admit to commentators that he didn't know how to swim. When a reporter asked him why he tried the race, Frazier replied, \"How was I to know I couldn't unless I tried it?\". He also famously opined, \"That Mark Spitz,\" (who had won several gold medals for swimming at the 1972 Olympics) \"is a tough muthafucker!\"\n\nSpin-offs included a women's version of the show, and a \"Superteams\" version, where the two World Series and Super Bowl teams each faced off (except that the owner of the New York Yankees at the time, George Steinbrenner prohibited his players from competing, so in years where the Yankees were in the World Series, their league's runner-up competed instead), with the winners competing in the finals. There were also brief runs of versions for celebrities and for juniors, where each state's Department of Education was asked to nominate one high school, and those schools each sent one boy and one girl to qualifying rounds, with the final aired on TV.\n\nThe show remained popular in the 1970s, but ratings declined and the last edition produced by ABC came in 1984. NBC Sports picked up the program the next year and carried it from 1985 to 1990. ABC took the show back in 1991, and broadcast it through 1994. During a three-year period (1991–1993) the event was held in Cancun, Mexico. The competitions were held in different areas of Cancun Palace and Melia Cancun hotels. During that period former great NFL players Frank Gifford, Dan Dierdorf and Lynn Swann worked as commentators of the Superstars Tournament.\n\nThere was no American version for three years (1995–1997) then ABC revived the show in 1998 and broadcast it through 2002. CBS Sports picked up the show the next year.\n\nSeveral athletes won the event two or more times. Among them:\n\nSpeed skater Anne Henning won three straight women's competitions (1976–78). Basketball player Ann Meyers matched that feat in 1981 through 1983. Volleyball player Linda Fernandez won two straight events in 1979 and 1980.\n\nIn 2009 the franchise was revived for ABC. \"The Superstars\" paired athletes and celebrities to compete as a team. Kristi Leskinen (Freestyle Skiing) and Maksim Chmerkovskiy (Ballroom Dancing) won the competition.\n\nThe popular obstacle course was the final event of the original \"Superstars\" to determine the overall winner. The \"Superteams\" version featured the obstacle course as an earlier event. The original course had the contestants climb a 12' rope wall, run through a tubular tunnel, push a blocking sled (or traverse across monkey bars in the Women's and \"Superteams\" versions), cleanly step through a dozen tires (2 rows of 6), jump over a water hazard (rectangular pool of water), clear a 4'6\" high bar, jump two sets of hurdles and cross the FINISH line. Penalty seconds were added for missing tires, stepping in the water hazard and knocking down the high bar and/or hurdles. Some athletes have shown super skills on this course by climbing the wall without using the rope and clearing the high bar like a hurdle.\n\nFor the 2009 \"elimination event\" version, contestants have to climb a rope wall, duck under four rope hurdles (2 sets side-by-side) (this was changed mid-season to a balance beam just over 3-inches wide), cleanly step through a bungee grid, ascend and descend a large ramp, push through a large door-like block, jump two sets of hurdles, run through a cargo net and cross the FINISH line.\n\nA companion competition, this event would pit the two World Series teams and the two Super Bowl teams in a playoff-type match using all the Superstars events, with some team events added such as Hawaiian rowing and the Tug-of-War. The running, swimming, and cycling events were relays, with the cycling done on tandem bikes; the obstacle course (which had its blocking sleds replaced by monkey bars similar to those used in the women's competition, as it was felt that the football teams would have too much of an advantage over the baseball teams) was decided by best combined time. The team that won the most events in each semi-final advanced to the SuperTeams finals where an ultimate champions would be crowned. The New York Yankees advanced to the World Series in 1977, 1978, and 1981, and was eligible to participate in these events held the early in the following year, however Yankees owner George Steinbrenner refused to allow his players to compete, as he had several of his top players under lucrative long term guaranteed contracts that required players to get ownership permission to participate in outside athletic activities, which in this case Steinbrenner refused to grant. In those years, loser of the ALCS in those years took the Yankees place, and in all three years that team ultimately won the competition.\n\nIn the 1978 final, the Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Royals split the first six events, so the tug-of-war would decide the winner. However, while there was a time limit in the preliminary rounds, there was none in the final, and after 75 minutes in which neither team came particularly close to winning, the organizers declared the event (and, as a result, the competition) a tie.\n\n\n1977 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nIn 1976, following the success of the \"Superstars\" programme in the US, Britain and mainland Europe, Dick Button and American host broadcaster ABC decided to organise a World Superstars Final, to be held the following March at Callaway Gardens in Georgia.\n\nThe participants in the inaugural \"World Superstars Championship\" were to be the competitors from across the various national and continental versions of the show with the best records in the previous years, and as such the US was to be represented by its previous national champions Bob Seagren, O. J. Simpson, and three time reigning current champion Kyle Rote, Jr. The rest of the participants were to be drawn from the top six finishers from the 1976 European Superstars final, the top six from the US version in 1977, and the winner of the 1976 Canadian Superstars event. In reality, as was always an issue for Superstars, several competitors withdrew in the weeks before the contest, with Rote and Simpson pulling out just a week before taping, leaving a slightly weakened field headed by Seagren, double European champion Kjell Isaksson, Canadian champion Tony Gabriel and the joint runners-up from the US final Guy Drut and Dave Casper.\n\nAside from the withdrawals of Rote and Simpson the other major omission from the field was the double British champion and 1975 European runner-up David Hemery who was studying at university in the US, and had failed to qualify for the 1976 European final after finishing a narrow third in his heat. Had he paddled his Kayak 0.4 seconds faster or scored two more points in the pistol shooting he would have made the final, and with other strong European challengers (like Ties Kruize, Kevin Keegan and Björn Borg) also absent, the European challenge was significantly poorer.\n\nThe contest started with Rowing, where Peter Snell capitalised on a mistake from fellow athlete Frank Nusse to win the first ten points, then the penalty shoot-out. Here Gareth Edwards was one kick away from winning nearly $5000, but he fluffed his final shot and had to settle for a five-way tie for second place, while Guy Drut easily won the play-off, and took the money. After this it became a two-way contest between the two pole-vaulters, Isaksson and Seagren.\n\nControversially, Seagren (by nature of being retired from IAAF competition) was allowed to run in the track and field events, while Isaksson was not. Seagren later admitted that this gave him a major advantage over his younger, Swedish rival, as running was a fundamental part of any pole-vaulter's training regime, and thus they had to be favoured in such events. While Seagren was unable to win the 100 yard sprint, he did score two points, and his win in the half-mile race gave him a further ten. Isaksson countered with a win in the gym tests and two second-place finishes in the bike race and weightlifting. Seagren however kept competing strongly and his victory in the swimming and second place in the gym tests saw him take a 33 points to 30 lead over Snell and Isaksson into the final event: the obstacle course.\n\nThis event was not held in Europe, and therefore Isaksson was attempting it for the first time. In the heats Isaksson ran a time of 25.81 seconds, while Snell was far behind with 29.2 seconds. Seagren however, with much more experience in the event, ran 0.8 seconds faster than the Swede, finishing in 24.64 seconds. His loss in the final to record holder Lynn Swann was irrelevant; the seven points for second place made him the first World Superstars Champion, and won him $37,000 in the process.\n\n1978 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nWith the Superstars franchise nearing its zenith of popularity, the World Championship returned in 1978 with a 12-man field consisting of the national champions from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the top three finishers from the 1977 European Superstars final, and the top five from the 1978 US National Championship. Completing the line-up was the returning champion, Bob Seagren.\n\nThough the 1977 runner-up Kjell Isaksson was missing (he would not compete in Superstars again until 1980), Europe was strongly represented by Jean-Paul Coche, Keith Fielding and Ties Kruize, while Wayne Grimditch, Greg Pruitt and Dwight Stones (who could famously jump up the 10-feet high obstacle course wall in one stride) represented the US. It was the Canadian champion however, Brian Budd, who would completely dominate the contest, and World Superstars for the next three years.\n\nBudd was a strong all-round athlete, his soccer training covering swimming, running, bike racing and gym work. He also understood that the key to winning Superstars was to win as many points as possible in the events you were good at, and to hold on for as many points as possible in the others. He turned out to be nearly unbeatable in the gym, half-mile race and the swimming, and more than competent in cycling and rowing. In 1978 he won 44 points from these five events alone, ten points more than he needed to become World Champion.\n\nIn the 100-yard dash, joint favourites Greg Pruitt and Keith Fielding were both unbeaten in the 100 yards/metres, and a fabulous race was in prospect. Budd got off to a blistering start – according to the UK commentator Ron Pickering it was 'a flyer' – and led in the first 30 yards, but Pruitt, then Fielding accelerated, and the two had a large lead over the rest of the field. As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt's shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together. Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding's challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from Ron Pickering at track-side.\n\nFielding eventually battled on bravely to finish fifth (and top European), but it was Bob Seagren who again gave the strongest challenge. His consistent performances won him a clear second place, but he was still 14 points behind Budd. The Canadian had joked and fooled his way through the contest, but it was all a very good act. He was far and away the best multi-disciplined athlete in the field, and he would prove just as unbeatable in the following two years.\n\n1979 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nThe third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of Freeport, Bahamas. Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion. The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups Lynn Davies and Dave Boy Green and Irish Superstars champion Pat Spillane. The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury. If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, Wayne Grimditch, Jim Taylor and Joe Theismann all qualifying. Completing the line-up were two invited challengers – not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though. Instead the organisers had asked both Emerson Fittipaldi and Rafael Septién to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success. They did however represent Brazil and Mexico respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in Latin America. They would have little impact on the final.\n\nThat was not the case for Budd, who dominated again, winning three events comprehensively, setting new records in the swimming and half-mile run in the process. He also finished third in every other event he competed in, winning the title by thirteen points this time. While Grimditch and Pruitt won multiple events, they could not match Budd's consistency. Neither could the best European, Lynn Davies, who finished second in four events but disappointed in the weightlifting and gym tests. In the end only two points separated second to fourth, with Grimditch beating Pruitt for second on count-back, and Davies two points back in fourth.\n\nBudd had set new standards, and most viewers thought him unbeatable. There was only one caveat to this victory. The top Europeans Kruize and Jacks were not present, and with Jacks in particular even more dominant in the gym tests than Budd there were questions asked about what he could have achieved. They would meet a year later.\n\n1980 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nBrian Budd won by the largest margin ever in the World Championship, winning three of the sports and finishing second in four. Because this was his third consecutive championship, he was not allowed to participate in any more Superstars competitions.\n\n1981 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\n1982 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nFor the British, European and International version of the show, and in all episodes broadcast in the UK (regardless of where the episode originated) the theme music is \"Heavy Action\", written by Johnny Pearson. The strong association of the theme music to Superstars has led to the music being frequently misidentified as \"Superstars\", even though it is used in other countries as the theme to other sports events (such as in the United States, where versions of the piece have served as the long-time theme music of the NFL \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts on ABC and later ESPN).\n\nWhile not necessarily written specifically for the UK version of Superstars (with Heavy Action instead being written by Pearson for the BBC music library in 1970 while he was working on \"Top of the Pops\"), the music has now become synonymous with both Superstars in the UK, and indeed sport in general, still regularly used by the BBC on sports shows, such as during the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe ABC version in the 1970s and 1980s also used an instrumental version of \"Superstar\" from \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" as its theme.\n\n"}
{"id": "1654279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1654279", "title": "Swimsuit competition", "text": "Swimsuit competition\n\nA swimsuit competition, more commonly now called a bikini contest, is a beauty contest in which one of the judging criteria is the physical attributes of contestants, which is judged and ranked while contestants wear a swimsuit, typically a bikini.\n\nBikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products, masquerading as mild adult entertainment in the forms of a beauty contest. Swimwear competitions have been a part of beauty pageants, such as the Miss America and Miss World pageants and by organizations such as Hawaiian Tropic, and may also be held in a bar or nightclub, during intermissions of boxing or wrestling matches or at a car show. Bodybuilding and fitness competitions have evolved to include a bikini division. Participants in such contests may be competing for prizes including trophies, money, and modeling contracts.\n\nIn the United States, beauty pageants of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern \"Miss America\" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.\n\nPublic swimsuit competitions are subject to local decency laws, which generally require nipples and labia to be covered. More specific standards of dress or nudity may be determined by the contest organisers. Contestants may be permitted or required to wear certain types of bikini, such as the microkini (a bikini consisting of a minimal top and thong). Contest organisers may also specify the contestants' age range. In many contests the winners are determined by a panel of judges, but in some cases formal judging is absent and the winner is decided by popular vote. Announcers often present the competition, and they may also help the contestants to connect with the crowd. Winning over the crowd is of principal importance for many competitions, as results can be heavily influenced by audience input.\n\nBikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products. Miss Hawaiian Tropic is organized by Playtex to promote \"Hawaiian Tropic\", its suntan lotion. NOPI runs the annual Hot Import Nights bikini contest, which is held in conjunction with the import car-show in Atlanta, Georgia, and the annual Hooter's bikini competition.\n\nThere are some swimsuit competitions which aim to judge the beauty of a single part of body, such as female buttocks (for example, the Miss Bum Bum contest held in Brazil, and the Miss Reef contest held in several South American countries).\n\nDespite their popularity and women's voluntary participation, swimsuit competitions, especially bikini contests, may be controversial. Critics argue that beauty contests reinforce the idea that girls and women are primarily valued for their physical appearance, and that this puts pressure on women to conform to conventional beauty standards by spending time and money on fashion, cosmetics, hair styling and even cosmetic surgery. It depletes their bodies of nutrients, energy and even water at the end and expresses a totally unrealistic and unsustainable lifestyle, centered purely around how little fat and how much spray tan they have on. This pursuit of physical beauty even encourages some women to diet to the point of harming themselves.\n\nThe first Miss World contest was organized by Eric Morley in 1951 as a promotion for swimwear at the Festival of Britain. The press welcomed the spectacle and referred to it as \"Miss World\". When the winner Kiki Håkansson from Sweden was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. The bikinis were outlawed and evening gowns introduced instead. Håkansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini, a crowning that was condemned by the Pope. The bikini was banned from Miss World beauty pageants after the controversy.\n\nBikinis reappeared in later contests amid additional controversy. In the 1970s and 1980s the contest was regularly picketed by feminist protesters. The pageant disappeared for a while and in 1996, when the Miss World contest was held in Bangalore, India, dozens of Indian groups opposed to the event claimed that the contest degraded women by featuring them in bikinis. Social activist Subhashini Ali commented, \"It's not an IQ test. Neither is it a charity show. It's a beauty contest in which these things have been added on as sops.\" The protests were so intense that the organizers were finally compelled to shift the venue of the \"Swimsuit Round\" to Seychelles. Countering these claims, the contest organizer says that the organization has raised ₤300 million for charity in many of the countries where it operates since 2000.\n\nIn 2013, the Miss World event was hosted by Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. The country's top Muslim clerical body, the Indonesian Ulema Council, suggested that the event should be cancelled because it promotes \"hedonism, materialism, and consumerism,\" and is nothing but \"an excuse to show women's body parts that should remain covered.\" The organizers later announced that the bikini would be replaced by one-piece swimsuits and sarongs, traditional beachwear on the resort island of Bali. Pageant Chairwoman Julia Morley explained, \"I do not want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful.\"\n\nCritics accuse the Miss World organizers of caving to extremist pressures. They point out that Bali is a destination for tourists from across the world who often wear minimal swimwear.\n\nBrooke Magnanti argued that the decision to yield to religious fundamentalists was not a victory for feminism:\n\nDonald Trump, who owned the Miss Universe beauty pageant until it was acquired by William Morris Endeavor, a competitor to the Miss World contest, was delighted to learn of the rival organization's decision. He told Fox TV, \"Well, I own Miss Universe, so I'm actually very happy about it—because if Miss World doesn't have bikinis their ratings go right down the tubes.\" Coincidentally, Miss Teen USA, a Miss Universe pageant, abolished swimsuit competitions in favour of a sportswear competition in 2016.\n\nVida Samadzai was the 2003 Afghani contestant for the Miss Earth title. She was severely condemned by the both Afghan authorities and community for seeking the title. Samadzai was born in Afghanistan but raised in the United States. She was living in India at the time of the contest. The Afghan Supreme Court banned swimsuit contests and said that appearing naked in beauty contests is completely un-Islamic, and is against Afghan tradition, human honour and dignity. Habiba Sarabi, the Afghan women affairs minister, said Samadzai's semi-naked appearance \"is not women's freedom but in my opinion is to entertain men\". Afghanistan's embassy in Washington DC declared that claims by Afghan American Samadzai to represent Afghanistan is baseless. Samadzai, the second woman to be crowned Miss Afghanistan after Zohra Daoud's crowning in 1972, received a number of death threats and had to be under the protection of FBI for three months. She said she was a bit uncomfortable wearing the \"70s style red bikini\" and was aware of the risks involved.\n\n\"Miss Tanguita\", which translates as \"Miss Child Bikini\", is held in Barbosa, Santader, Colombia as annual part of the \"del Rio Suarez\" Festival. The organisers deny the allegations that the competition is a camouflage for sexual exploitation, and instead describe it as an awareness event about the importance of children's fitness. Activists say that the competition, though legal, abuses the human rights of minors.\n\nBeginning in 2016, the Miss Teen USA pageant removed the swimsuit competition and replaced it with an athleticwear round.\n\n\n"}

Many talent shows are performances rather than contests, but some are actual contests. In the instance of a contest, participants may be motivated to perform for a reward, trophy, or prize of some kind. For example, a high school might not have many students with any interest in performing in front of the student body for the sole purpose of performing alone and may offer different prizes as an incentive for these students to participate in the contest.\n\nSince the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of reality television, such as \"Notun Kuri\" (1976), \"Popstars\" (1999), \"Star Academy\" (2001), \"Idol\" (2001), \"The X Factor\" (2004), \"So You Think You Can Dance\" (2005), \"Got Talent\" (2006), \"The Voice\" (2010), \"Rising Star\" (2013), \"Tri Akkorda (Russian Talent Show) (2014)\" and \" (\"2018\")\", which have been critical in catapulting some amateur artists to stardom and resulting in their commercially successful careers.\n\nTalent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent juvenile delinquency among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as \"Girls Only!\" in San Diego to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.\n"}
{"id": "232863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232863", "title": "The Fairly OddParents", "text": "The Fairly OddParents\n\nThe Fairly OddParents is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman that originally aired on Nickelodeon from March 30, 2001, to July 26, 2017. The series follows the everyday misadventures of Timmy Turner, a boy who is granted two fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda. It was produced by Nelvana (2001–2004), Frederator Studios, Nickelodeon Animation Studios and Billionfold Inc. (2008–2017).\n\nThe series originated from shorts on the animation showcase, \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\", airing from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a series due to its popularity. Originally, it ended in 2006 totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. The series was cancelled after the 10th season.\n\nSet in the fictional town of Dimmsdale, California, a 10-year-old boy named Timmy Turner is neglected by his parents and tortured by his babysitter Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes are guaranteed to inadvertently cause a series of technical problems that Timmy must fix. In the beginning of the series, Timmy's babysitter Vicky was the main antagonist. As the series progressed, more villains were included; for example, his teacher, Mr. Crocker, firmly believes in fairy godparents and has been searching for them a very long time, correctly suspecting that Timmy has fairy godparents. He is dangerous to Timmy because, according to \"Da Rules\", a large rulebook that defines what children can and cannot wish for and how fairy godparents must behave, no one else can know about his fairy godparents and they will be taken away if this happens (although they don't remember, Cosmo and Wanda once used to be Crocker's fairy godparents, as this rule does not apply to people who currently have their own or once had fairy godparents).\n\nAt his school, Timmy is often bullied by Francis, a vicious boy who claims to be the toughest student in school, but reveals to Timmy that he only takes out his anger on him because of his rough home life and abusive parents. Jorgen Von Strangle, the enormous and tough head fairy with an Austrian accent, similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, personally dislikes Timmy and his fairies at first, but at times he has to assist them in fixing their problems.\n\nLater in the series, Timmy wished that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof. More recently, Timmy got a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Also introduced is the premise that for every fairy, there is also an anti-fairy. The anti-fairies are similar to the real ones, but with opposite personalities and character traits. For example, Anti-Cosmo is intelligent and speaks with an English accent while real Cosmo is dim-witted. Similarly, Anti-Wanda is also dim-witted and speaks with a Southern American accent while real Wanda is intelligent. When Poof was born, his anti-fairy was created. Anti-Poof's name is Foop (Poof spelled backwards). While Poof is spherical, Foop is shaped like a cube. Foop's goal in life is to cause mayhem and destroy his nemesis Poof.\n\nEven later in the series, Timmy is informed that due to a shortage of available fairies, he must now share Cosmo and Wanda with his new neighbor, Chloe Carmichael, who is essentially his polar opposite. She loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly.\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. The city appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings and a city hall but also containing uptown areas with residences (including the house where Timmy and his parents and godparents live) and businesses (including Timmy's school; a hospital; stores; a sports complex named the Dimmadome, named after its founder and owner; the local TV channel; and various restaurants and stores) as well as a park in the center of the city. The city also appears to have rural farmland located somewhere outside of the city. The adults in the city are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still form a structured and complex society capable of working as a city. In the episode \"Which Witch is Which\", it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1630s after Dale Dimm managed to defeat a witch hunter who was secretly a witch named Alden Biterroot (a possible ancestor of Denzel Crocker).\n\nWhen the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the magical realm and home of the fairies which is a floating world located within the sky and colored with an abundance of pink. The fairies have a civilization like that of the humans, but with a source of power being magic, which also keeps the world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth. Another location sometimes seen is the city of Chincinatti, the home town of Timmy's favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the anti-fairies live; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the pixies; and Yugopotamia, where an alien, Mark Chang, lives, who is also Timmy's friend.\n\n\nThroughout the course of the show, many celebrities have guest starred on \"The Fairly OddParents\", including most notably Adam West and Jay Leno. Some celebrities that voice characters include: Norm Macdonald, Chris Kirkpatrick, Alec Baldwin, Ben Stein, Jackie Mason, Jason Bateman, Rick Fox, Gilbert Gottfried, Michael Clarke Duncan, Brendan Fraser, Patrick Warburton, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Tom Arnold, and Scott Hamilton.\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" was originally pitched to Cartoon Network. The pilot was never shown to Cartoon Network, but it was pitched while show creator Butch Hartman was working on Cartoon Network's \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Johnny Bravo\", \"Cow and Chicken\", and \"I Am Weasel\". The show's pilot was not actually made until the show was pitched to Nick. Creator/Producer Butch Hartman originally created \"The Fairly OddParents\" as a seven-minute short film entitled \"Fairy Godparents\", one of 39 short cartoons in the first season of Fred Seibert's \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\". Butch Hartman made six more short films for the show in season 3. Nickelodeon agreed to a seven episode order (consisting of two 11-minute segments) of \"The Fairly Oddparents\", which began airing on March 30, 2001, in the half-hour after fellow Nicktoon \"Invader Zim\".\n\nUnlike the half-hour series, the animation in the shorts is not as smooth, and the designs are notably different (including Timmy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the pilot episodes and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky's abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include the voices like Timmy Turner, who was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman instead of Tara Strong. Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series. Wanda is shown to be less intelligent and less of a nag. Vicky is much less evil than in the current series. She also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used \"twerp\".\n\nOriginally, Hartman wanted Timmy to wear a blue hat, but since it would blend in with the walls of the bedroom, he decided to make it pink. Wanda was originally going to be named \"Venus\", but instead named her Wanda. Her middle name was and still is \"Venus.\"\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" was immediately popular, greatly increasing its lead-in rating from \"Invader Zim\". In fact, no matter what time slot Nickelodeon placed the show in, Nick's ratings soared. The series attracted a wider than anticipated audience, appealing to all ages. It was later Nickelodeon's highest rated show. Early 2002 and 2003 was the first peak of popularity for \"The Fairly OddParents\". Its ratings skyrocketed. The series appeared in a $50 Best Western travel card during summer 2006 and again in summer 2007.\n\nA theatrical film based on the series was planned for release by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies, but it was eventually dropped because of a management change at Paramount, although the script was written. Hartman stated on his website that he would like to release the film on DVD one day, but there were not definitive plans to do so.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Butch Hartman announced on his forum that Nickelodeon had ceased production of the show. \"The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators\" was intended to be the fifth-season finale and series finale in production order, airing on July 21, 2006. However, Nickelodeon broadcast the episode \"Timmy the Barbarian/No Substitute for Crazy\" after \"The Jerkinators\" as the fifth-season finale, on November 25 of that year.\n\nHartman announced on his forum on February 2, 2007, that Nick granted \"Fairly OddParents\" twenty more episode slots, making sure the show resumed production. Later on July 7, \"77 Secrets of the Fairly OddParents Revealed\" hinted that a new character would join the series.\n\nAfter a one-year hiatus, Nickelodeon announced on TV that they would begin the broadcast of a television movie called \"Fairly OddBaby\" as the beginning of at least 20 episodes of Season 6, and to carry the show to at least the year 2011. A huge hit, \"Fairly OddBaby\" aired on February 18, 2008, becoming the top entertainment program across broadcast and basic cable TV for the year among kids.\n\nOn March 14, 2012, the series was renewed for a ninth season with new episodes that were scheduled to broadcast that year. Additionally, the second live action film, \"A Fairly Odd Christmas\", aired in November 2012. The ninth season premiered the same day as the 2013 Kids Choice Awards. The ninth season introduced another character, Timmy's fairy dog, Sparky. Season nine is also the first season to be formatted in high definition and widescreen. In 2013, it was announced there would be a third installment called \"A Fairly Odd Summer\" with Drake Bell and Daniella Monet reprising their respective roles. The movie premiered on August 2, 2014. New episodes were confirmed by Fred Seibert on April 11, 2015.\n\nOn August 17, 2015, a tenth season was announced, and introduced another character, Chloe Carmichael, Timmy's new neighbor who also has Cosmo and Wanda as her fairy godparents. The tenth season aired from January 15, 2016, to July 26, 2017, on both Nickelodeon and Nicktoons.\n\nIn 2004, Butch Hartman revealed his intentions to make a \"Crash Nebula\" spin-off. The pilot episode \"Crash Nebula\" was aired as part of the show's fourth season. Despite this, Nickelodeon decided to not pick up the series. However, in 2006, Hartman stated that he was confident and would try to get the spin-off greenlighted in the future. He also wrote a script entitled \"Crash Nebula: The Movie\" for Paramount Pictures, but the film was cancelled due to its similarities with Disney's \"Sky High\".\n\nIn 2005 or 2006, Butch Hartman had also considered making a theatrical adaptation of his animated television series \"The Fairly OddParents\" after the show's initial cancellation in 2006, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures. The film was to be animated much like the series as well as previous Nickelodeon fare such as the \"Rugrats\" film series and \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", but was scrapped due to a management change at Paramount although the script was already written. Despite this, Hartman expressed interest in releasing the film for DVD someday, and stated that the script could serve for another TV movie of the show. However, with the show's cancellation on July 26, 2017 and Butch Hartman's decision to leave Nickelodeon in early 2018, it seemingly ends any chances of that happening.\n\nDuring its original 5–season run, the series received immensely positive reviews despite some criticism for focusing solely on child-based humor while other Nickelodeon shows such as \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" included adult-based humor and dark humor.\n\nDespite concerns about if the show would jump the shark, the introduction of the character Poof in \"Fairly OddBaby\" was well received. Seasons 6 through 8 received positive reviews even as several possible finales such as the \"Wishology\" Trilogy and \"Timmy's Secret Wish\" airing with the show continuing afterwards.\n\nThe introduction of the character Sparky in season 9 was heavily criticized with the character being deemed unnecessary and annoying. His introduction, seen as an attempt to increase ratings, has been compared to the character Scrappy-Doo in the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise. As a result, his character was removed for season 10.\n\n"}

The spectacle was staged outside the former Tsarist Winter Palace where the Provisional Government was meeting at the time of the Bolshevik revolution. Its performers included 125 ballet dancers, 100 circus people, 1,750 supernumeraries and students, 200 women, 260 secondary actors, and 150 assistants. There were also tanks and armoured cars involved.\n\nThe mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary Symbolist utopias of \"ritual theatre\" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution), and recast their \"people\" as the proletariat. Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators, the action begins with the February Revolution, follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a red stage to the left, with Kerensky and the Provisional Government on a white stage to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying \"Lenin, Lenin\" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the \"Whites.\" Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the cruiser \"Aurora\" and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. \n\nEvreinov's dramatic creation was extremely influential in the commemoration of the deposition of the Provisional Government, which in reality took place at night and was much less dramatic than depicted either in Evreinov's spectacle or in Sergei Eisenstein's feature film \"\" (1927). One of the over 100 surviving photographs from the spectacle, pictured above, was presented from 1922 on in many Soviet and also foreign publications as an authentic image from the events of 1917. For this purpose, the picture was heavily retouched, with the spectators on the right and a tower-like construction for directing the participants removed. The image is sometimes also misinterpreted as a film still from \"October\", though the \"storming\" in the film is set (historically correctly) at night, not during the day as in the photograph.\n\n"}

It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which catharsis is brought about.\n\nThe manuscript now resides in Paris, France, at the Bibliothèque Nationale; it is labeled \"Coislinianus 120\". The 10th-century manuscript resided at Great Lavra on Mount Athos. In 1643, Athanasius Rhetor sent it from Cyprus to Séguier de Coislin. The classicist J. A. Cramer, poring through the collection of Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin, was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; Richard Janko has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the \"Poetics\". Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by Theophrastus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "564661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564661", "title": "Video game producer", "text": "Video game producer\n\nA video game producer is the person in charge of overseeing development of a video game.\n\nThe earliest documented use of the term \"producer\" in games was by Trip Hawkins, who established the position when he founded Electronic Arts in 1982. Hawkins said in 1983:\n\nSierra On-Line's 1982 computer game \"Time Zone\" may be the first to list credits for \"Producer\" and \"Executive Producer\". As of late 1983 Electronic Arts had five producers: A product marketer and two others from Hawkins' former employer Apple (\"good at working with engineering people\"), one former IBM salesman and executive recruiter, and one product marketer from Automated Simulations; it popularized the use of the title in the industry. Hawkins' vision—influenced by his relationship with Jerry Moss—was that producers would manage artists and repertoire in the same way as in the music business, and Hawkins brought in record producers from A&M Records to help train those first producers. Activision made Brad Fregger their first producer in April 1983.\n\nAlthough the term is an industry standard today, it was dismissed as \"imitation Hollywood\" by many game executives and press members at the time. Over its entire history, the role of the video game producer has been defined in a wide range of ways by different companies and different teams, and there are a variety of positions within the industry referred to as \"producer\".\n\nThere are relatively few superstars of game production that parallel those in film, in part because top producers are usually employed by publishers who choose to play down publicizing their contributions. Unlike many of their counterparts in film or music, these producers do not run their own independent companies.\n\nMost video and computer games are developed by third-party developers. In these cases, there may be external and internal producers. External producers may act as \"executive producers\" and are employed by the game's publisher. Internal producers work for the developer itself and have more of a hands-on role. Some game developers may have no internal producers, however, and may rely solely on the publisher's producer.\n\nFor an internal producer, associate producers tend to specialize in an area of expertise depending on the team they are producing for and what skills they have a background in. These specializations include but are not limited to: programming, design, art, sound, and quality assurance. A normal producer is usually the project manager and is in charge of delivering the product to the publisher on time and on budget. An executive producer will be managing all of the products in the company and making sure that the games are on track to meet their goals and stay within the company's goals and direction.\n\nFor an external producer, their job responsibilities may focus mainly on overseeing several projects being worked on by a number of developers. While keeping updated on the progress of the games being developed externally, they inform the upper management of the publisher of the status of the pending projects and any problems they may be experiencing. If a publisher's producer is overseeing a game being developed internally, their role is more akin to that of an internal producer and will generally only work on one game or a few small games.\n\nAs games have grown larger and more expensive, line producers have become part of some teams. Based on filmmaking traditions, line producers focus on project scheduling and costing to ensure titles are completed on time and on budget.\n\nAn internal producer is heavily involved in the development of, usually, a single game. Responsibilities for this position vary from company to company, but in general, the person in this position has the following duties:\n\nIn short, the internal producer is ultimately responsible for timely delivery and final quality of the game.\n\nFor small games, the producer may interact directly with the programming and creative staff. For larger games, the producer will seek the assistance of the lead programmer, art lead, game designer and testing lead. While it is customary for the producer to meet with the entire development staff from time to time, for larger games, they will only meet with the leads on a regular basis to keep updated on the development status. In smaller studios, a producer may fill any slack in the production team by doing the odd job of writing the game manual or producing game assets.\n\nFor most games, the producer does not have a large role but does have some influence on the development of the video game design. While not a game designer, the producer has to weave the wishes of the publisher or upper management into the design. They usually seek the assistance of the game designer in this effort. So the final game design is a result the effort of the designer and some influence of the producer.\n\nIn general, the producer is not the \"boss\" of the people on the game development team, but the \"boss\" of the game. So while a programmer may answer to a programming director, where matters of the game are involved, they answer to the producer. Producers may issue reprimands or issue accolades, but usually the fate of the developer's employment is not in the hands of the producer. So while they may suggest termination or promotions of certain employees, the producer normally cannot fire or promote team members single-handedly.\n\nIn general, video game producers earn the third most out of game development positions, behind business (marketing/management) and programmers.\nAccording to an annual survey of salaries in the industry, producers earn an average of USD$75,000 annually. A video game producer with less than 3 years of experience makes, on average, around $55,000 annually. A video game producer with more than 6 years of experience makes, on average, over $125,000 annually. The salaries of a video game producer will vary depending on the region and the studio.\n\nMost video game producers complete a bachelor's degree program in game design, computer science, digital media or business. Popular computer programming languages for video game development include C, C++, Assembly and Java. Some common courses are communications, mathematics, accounting, art, digital modeling and animation.\n\nEmployers typically require three plus years of experience, since a producer has to have gone through the development cycle several times to really understand how unpredictable the business is. The most common path to becoming a video game producer begins by first working as a game tester, then moving up the quality assurance ladder, and then eventually on to production. This is easier to accomplish if one stays with the same studio, reaping the benefits of having built relationships with the production department.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4029918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4029918", "title": "Winter guard", "text": "Winter guard\n\nWinter guard is an indoor color guard sport derived from military ceremonies or veterans organizations ceremonies. Unlike traditional color guard, Winter Guard is performed indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances make use of recorded music rather than a live band or orchestra. Winter guard was invented in the United States, which remains the predominant scene for the sport.\n\nWinter Guard ensembles commonly perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by Winter Guard International. In most states, they have a cadet guard and high school guard.\n\nA Winter Guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of an instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team (\"the guard\") are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement choreography in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director.\n\nA winter guard team usually has a captain, who is one of the performing members who leads and represents the guard. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies or retreat.\n\nThe number of members on a winter guard team varies widely from five to approximately 45.\n\nThe duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time.\n\nUnlike traditional Color guard (flag spinning) teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a marching band or drum corps, winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music.\n\nIn competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves.\n\nJudges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn.\n\nThree primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres (other items can be used to demonstrate artistic effects.) Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity.\n\nThe most fundamental piece of equipment in color guard or winter guard shows is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot pole (metal) with a Three-foot \"silk\", often of a custom design. Smaller flags called \"swing flags\" are shortened poles with large silks connected to them. These poles are often plastic so they move more fluidly. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material.\n\nShaped similar to actual rifles, the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2–5 pounds (about 1–2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30–39 inches (about 76–99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts:\n\nRifles can be made out of both wood and plastic. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. They are all exactly the same. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.\n\nUsually rookies, people new to color guard, will use plastic rifles. They tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the users hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called polyethylene, this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performers hands. \n\nWooden rifles can be hard to use because they are all slightly different and may not be weighted the same, this is why people that are more familiar with rifles use them and not usually rookies. Most wooden rifles are made of either poplar or aspen wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. Electrical tape is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time.\n\nSabres are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30–39 inches (about 76–99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade. These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive.\n\nSabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a \"spotter\", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members.\n\nGuard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dance are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows. Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show.\n\nWinter Guard International is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly.\n\nBecause this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every Winter Guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi-finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area.\n\nThe phrase \"Sport of the Arts\" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying \"it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format.\"\n\nBecause not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this. There are two divisions, Scholastic and Independent. These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World, Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class.\n\nGuard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or \"bumped\", to the class above its current position, even mid-season.\n\nThe Scholastic division is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding.\n\nIn the Scholastic division, there are three classes: Scholastic A, Scholastic Open, and Scholastic World. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called Cadet. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams.\n\nThe Independent division is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender-specific or to only have certain numbers of members.\n\nIn the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: Independent A, Independent Open and Independent World. The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year.\n\nAlthough the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007. They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as Cadet, Novice, B, Regional AAA, Regional AA, Regional A, and Regional Open. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not.\n\nIn addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the European Indoor Arts Alliance (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.\n\n"}
