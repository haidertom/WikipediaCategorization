The games were formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She referred to the Commonwealth's \"shared ideals and ambitions\" and the \"bonds that unite\" its members.\n\nThe programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured Karen Dunbar, John Barrowman, Amy Macdonald, Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle, Nicola Benedetti, Julie Fowlis, Pumeza Matshikiza, Eric Whitacre and the National Youth Choir of Scotland, as well as a message from the International Space Station. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, explaining the partnership between the Games and UNICEF.\n\nFollowing the arrival of the Queen there was a flypast by the Red Arrows display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe, supplied by Sports Technology. Scotland's then First Minister Alex Salmond welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster.\n\nThe final part of the Queen's Baton Relay was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation HRH Prince Imran and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.\n\nThe Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed \"to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory.\"\n\nThe ceremony was broadcast by BBC One, and was introduced by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine, Clare Balding and Huw Edwards. The estimated worldwide television audience was one billion, with 9 million in the UK.\n\n\n"}

The term \"adventure\" is currently used by the game's publisher Wizards of the Coast.\n\nIn early editions of the game these publications were commonly referred to as \"modules\", which stems from the term \"dungeon module\", used to refer to the earliest adventures published by TSR, with other variations on the module name appearing on latter adventures. The term \"module\" continued to be popular among players of the original \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" even after newer publications were labeled \"adventure\". Adventures that appear as a part of a larger accessory are often referred to as scenarios.\n\nThe exact differences between the terms adventure, module, scenario, and accessory are hard to precisely define in \"Dungeons & Dragons\" terminology, as they all have been used in different ways.\n\nThe first published \"Dungeons & Dragons\" scenario was \"Temple of the Frog\", included in 1975's \"Blackmoor\" \"Dungeons & Dragons\" rules supplement. This scenario was later developed into the stand-alone module DA2 – \"Temple of the Frog\" for the \"D&D Expert set\" rules (TSR, 1986).\n\nThe first stand-alone \"Dungeons & Dragons\" adventure module, \"Palace of the Vampire Queen\", was published in 1976 by Wee Warriors. Although TSR did not produce this module, the company did distribute the first three printings on behalf of Wee Warriors. The adventure was described as a \"Dungeon Masters Kit\" rather than a \"module\" or an \"adventure\".\n\nAlso in 1976, the adventure \"Lost Caverns of Tsojconth\" was distributed by Metro Detroit Gamers as the tournament module for the gaming convention Wintercon V, but was not published for general distribution at the time. The adventure was later re-written for the first edition \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" rules and published as module S4 – \"The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth\" (TSR, 1982).\n\nAdditional unpublished adventures were distributed at gaming conventions during this period, including \"Steading of the Hill Giant Chief\", used as a tournament module for Origins '78. Later in 1978, \"Steading of the Hill Giant Chief\" became the first stand-alone \"Dungeons & Dragons\" module actually produced and published by TSR. TSR Hobbies produced a series of six adventures in 1978 that had previously only been used in tournaments. The company initiated its practice of assigning a code to each module published at the time, assigning the \"G1\" code to \"Steading of the Hill Giant Chief\". TSR's practice of coding modules into various series would continue into the 1990s.\n\nThe standard adventure is essentially an adventure kit including a backstory, maps and one or more objectives for the players to fulfill. Some include numerous illustrations. A Dungeon Master could purchase these pre-made adventures and use it or parts of it for a gaming session. The early format was a single booklet inserted, but not fixed, in a cardboard cover. As time went by the format and information included in module increased in variety. Dark Sun modules, for example, contained top-spiralbound notebooks. Eventually, the line blurred somewhat between what was an accessory or supplement and a module.\n\nModules had a suggested character level, often displayed prominently on the cover, and from the late 1980s prominently display the logo of the campaign setting they were set in. Some modules were reprints or revisions of modules used at gaming conventions before being published. All early modules are now out of print, though some have been reprinted in revised form. As such, many early modules are now highly sought-out collector items, particularly the earliest printings.\n\nExcept for a few early limited edition modules, all \"Dungeons & Dragons\" modules until late 1994 were denoted with an alphanumeric code consisting of a letter and a number. The letter codes were based in some way on the product, with the number following the letter designating what number the product was in the series. Modules within a letter set were usually somehow related, either thematically or as a series of linked adventures. For example, Z1 may be a prologue to Z2. Or Z1, Z2 and Z3 may have the adventurers fighting a similar enemy such as beholders. Though related, most modules were stand-alone and could be played without playing any of the other related modules.\n\nTSR also used the module coding system on modules for several of non-\"Dungeons & Dragons\" roleplaying games including modules for \" (Advanced) Marvel Super-Heroes\" and the \"Conan Role-Playing Game\". The module code was de-emphasised in the late 1980s, which also saw the campaign setting logo become a main feature of the cover. The code was dropped altogether by the end of 1993. In 2008, the adventure code was reintroduced with the release of the 4th edition \"Dungeons & Dragons\" adventure: H1 Keep on the Shadowfell.\n\n"}

{"id": "31604229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31604229", "title": "Ancillary market", "text": "Ancillary market\n\nAncillary markets are non-theatrical markets for feature films, like home video, television, Pay Per View, VOD, Internet streaming, airlines and others.\n\nBefore television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules. Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961 by programming \"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies.\" After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965.\n\nToday, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box-office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows:\n\n\nThe sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market.\n\nHome video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS). Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape. After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.\n\nAs the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.\n\nThe first premium rate television services were Phonevision, Telemeter, SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office (HBO) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: Z Channel, Showtime, The Movie Channel, Cinemax, Spotlight and Home Theater Network. Only Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video.\n\nOut of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. Amanda D. Lotz spoke on the radical change in her book titled \"Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008).\"\nShe mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.<Lotz 85> At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi-channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office.\n\nAccording to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p. 107).\n\nVideo games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product. Some movies that have benefited from this are the \"Harry Potter\", \"Lord of the Rings\", and \"James Bond\" series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of \"Halo\" have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.\n\nHollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.\n\nHollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself. The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk.\nIn addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, \"A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales.\" Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry.\n\n"}
{"id": "28485759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28485759", "title": "Balloon fetish", "text": "Balloon fetish\n\nA balloon fetish is a sexual fetish that involves balloons. A balloon fetishist is also referred to as a \"looner\". Some balloon fetishists \"revel in the popping of balloons and [others] may become anxious and tearful at the very thought of popping balloons\". Others enjoy blowing up balloons or sitting and lying on them.\n\nLike many paraphilias, the origins of a balloon fetish are complex and vary between individuals, but may be explained as a form of sexual imprinting. Many \"looners\" attribute their fetish to early sexual or pre-sexual experiences with balloons, often involving their being burst by members of the desirable sex. These experiences frequently accompany or instigate a phobia of balloons in the individual, most often associated with the sudden loud noise when they burst, a form of phonophobia.\n\nDepending on the extent to which this phobia persists through and after puberty, balloon fetishists may regard balloons bursting as either essential to the sexual experience (and frequently refer to themselves as poppers), or to be avoided at all costs (as non-poppers). Even those who are not phobic of the act of a balloon popping may prefer not to pop due to an anthropomorphized emotional attachment to the balloon, which is perfectly normal to non-poppers. One hallmark of the distinction between poppers and non-poppers may be in seeing balloons' bursting either as a metaphor for orgasm, or as a metaphor for death.\n\nThat popping balloons is central to several popular party games suggests that enjoyment of the act, the challenge, and the anticipation of popping is not confined to fetishists. However, for fetishists the adrenaline rush associated with the \"danger\" that a balloon will pop produces a sexual response. This helps to explain why even non-poppers who have an intense phobia of balloons popping in non-sexual contexts may be aroused by the possibility within safe sexual contexts. It may even suggest that balloon fetish, for poppers and non-poppers alike, is part of the BDSM spectrum of fetishes in which a controlled amount of danger is used to elicit a pleasurable fight-or-flight response in participants.\n\nA true fetish is characterized in the DSM-IV by its social and occupational impedance. However, it is currently in the DSM-V (see Paraphilic Disorders) to where a fetish is no longer considered as a disorder (except for fetishistic disorder where if the fetish interferes with the person's life). Yet, fetishism is classified as code F65.0 in the ICD-10. Aside from these hazards, balloon fetishism carries with it the hazards of bursting balloons in close proximity to one's body. Eye and ear protection is recommended for such exposure to avoid eye damage or hearing loss. These hazards may be heightened since balloon fetishists often employ larger-than-average balloons and high-energy forms of popping them, such as overinflation.\n\nIn addition, those who sit, stomp, or lie on large balloons may be vulnerable to fall injuries when the balloons burst. Additional injuries may occur due to friction and static electricity during prolonged interactions with balloons. Choking is a potential risk for those \"looners\" for whom the fetish includes kissing or mouthing the balloon. Although largely hypothetical, a \"looner\" engaged in an orgy with multiple helium-filled balloons may sustain impact injuries such as pelvic fractures, falling from heights at the moment of climax.\n\nA different form of this fetish is the \"Bubblegum Balloon Fetish\" or \"Bubblegum Looning\", where, instead of latex balloons, Bubblegum is used to produce small to big balloons (depending on the size of the gum). In this case, the \"popper\" or \"non-popper\" difference is absent since balloons can be produced over and over (differently from latex ones, that, once burst, have to be discarded).\nBubblegum looners tend to like watching people produce balloons with bubblegum or producing balloons themselves.\n\nAs with balloon looning, Bubblegum Looning can be used in sexual activities to enhance sexual performances. In this case, bubblegum balloons may also be blown against some partner's body parts to enhance sexual excitement or as a form of game play.\n\nA number of looners also enjoy other variations, such as rubber glove balloons (mainly latex and nitrile medical gloves), condoms, beach balls, the Wubble Bubble Ball, inflatable PVC plastic toys (mainly blow up sharks, whales, and hammers), and inflating bin liners or garbage bags. The latter is often combined with a crush fetish where the looner is aroused the sight of glossy, polyethylene garbage sacks being compressed by the hydraulic compactor of a garbage truck or other similar apparatus to the point where they burst or explode - in its most extreme form this may even be combined with a form of vorarephilia, where the looner desires to be crushed and consumed by the machine itself along with the sacks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29560406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29560406", "title": "Bud Light Daredevils", "text": "Bud Light Daredevils\n\nThe Bud Light Daredevils were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998. The show combined gymnastics, trampoline, acrobatics, and basketball. The team was started by University of Mississippi cheerleaders Ty Cobb, Sam Martin, Robert Kirby, Tyler Hubbard, John White, and Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb.\n\nIn 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as Ole Miss Rebels mascot Colonel Reb) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic \"flip dunk\" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games.\n\nIn 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini-trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the Southeastern Conference (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games.\n\nWith the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called \"The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show\". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to National Basketball Association (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the \"Ole Miss Cheerleaders\" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the San Antonio Spurs in 1980, followed by shows for the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nStill in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the \"flip-pass\" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk (\"Congo Dunk\" 1987).\n\nFollowing his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13]\n\nIn 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of \"Dixie Daredevils\". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14]\n\nIn the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14]\n\nDuring the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and Guy Cobb performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called \"Budweiser Light\".[2]\nBoth Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer \"Budweiser Light\" to \"Bud Light\". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15]\n\nFrom 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10]\n\nAnheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18]\n\n"}

Unlike cliques, these associations often have names. These younger groups don't have the social competition that adolescent cliques do, or the level of bad behaviour that street gangs have. However, in rare instances there may be rivalry with other such groups around the same age, which can lead to physical fights between them.\n\nPeer leadership. Unlike group activities like Scouting, which are led by adults, these groups are led by children.\n\nPro forma secrecy. The secrecy may be more imaginary than real. For instance the name of the club (if it has one) and its membership are usually obvious to all. There may be a desire to create secret codes and plans, but they are rarely implemented. A ramshackle den, tree house, clubhouse, fort, or \"secret base\" may be built in nearby scrub-land or an abandoned building. Some children in a secret club may use a part of the grounds of the school they attend together as their \"base\" during periods of recess.\n\nSingle-sex membership. Such clubs are usually either all boys or all girls but not mixed but exceptions do occur. There may be a sense of competition between the genders, as well as independence from adult authority.\n\nCatch-phrase/greetings/secret words. Sometimes the clubs develop one or more secret catch-phrases or (sometimes nonsensical words) and greetings. This is illustrated in the 1982 film \"P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang\".\n\nMany schools have rules against secret clubs, and some jurisdictions even have laws prohibiting secret or invitation-only societies in public elementary or secondary schools.\n\nThe fact that interest in these clubs tends to be a passing phase at a certain age may result from the stages of children's cognitive development. After growing out of the \"egocentric\", or \"preoperational\" stage, reaching the \"age of reason\", one is able to understand other people's intentions. The next step is the ability to understand groups and the desire to belong to a club.\n\nWritten material about these secret clubs, such as the external links listed below, cites eight- and nine-year-olds most often. While slightly older children may also participate in secret clubs, they would be less expected to use fantasy elements in their activities.\n\nJuvenile comics and literature often feature such clubs as a plot device, often with spy or detective themes, and often far more organized than their real-life counterparts. A more realistic depiction is found in Zilpha Keatley Snyder's novel \"The Egypt Game\", in which six children gather in an abandoned storage yard to enact fantasy adventures and recreate actual ceremonies based on and adapted from their knowledge of ancient Egypt.\n\nMovies have featured such clubs, notably the early Ealing comedy-thriller \"Hue & Cry\". There are also juvenile non-fiction books that serve as \"how-to's\" for code-making and surveillance, most notably the Usborne \"Good Spy Guide\" series.\n\n\n"}

The award-winning TV advert was directed by Steve Barron (director of Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\", A-Ha's \"Take on Me\", and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\") and featured the track \"Something So Real\" by Scottish band, The Love Decree.\n\nIn 1989, a single was subsequently released and charted nationally, peaking at No.61 (No.1, Outselling Black Box's \"Ride On Time\" in Scotland).\nThe Love Decree were: Robin Gow (Keyboards/Songwriter), Grant Macintosh (Vocals/Songwriter) and Gordon Gow (Percussion). The track 'Something So Real\" was produced by Robin Gow.\n\nThe 'Chinheads' TV Ad can be viewed Here\n\nBen Elton's 1990 television show \"The Man from Auntie\" featured several chinface performances.\n\nIn 1993, an episode of \"Red Dwarf\", \"Gunmen of the Apocalypse\", Lister used a chinface when the crew had to convince a ship of simulants (artificially created, cyborg humanoids) that there were no humans aboard, insisting instead that the ship was crewed by curry-based lifeforms known as \"Vindaloovians\".\n\nSince video hosting sites have become available on the internet, chinface videos have become increasingly common.\n\nIn the mid–1990s, Kraft Canada released TV ads for Kraft Dinner featuring various people performing chinfaces and eating the product.\n\nThe video game \"You Don't Know Jack\" featured as an ending to Volume 4 \"(The Ride)\" footage showing part of the hosts' faces.

The climax of a story is a literary element.\n\nThe punch line of a joke is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any falling action is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of humor as opposed to the nature of drama.\n\nIn non-fictional narrative genres, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and \"plot\" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.\n\nIn the play \"Hippolytus\", by the famous Greek playwright, Euripides, the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that Aphrodite's curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.\n\nAn anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, \"Emergency Self-Destruct\", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of \"The War of the Worlds\", where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet Earth, the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.\n\n"}

Established in 1991, CAPE \"champions diversity by educating, connecting, and empowering Asian American and Pacific Islander artists and leaders in entertainment and media.\"\n\nCAPE was founded in 1991 as a way to connect AAPIs in the entertainment industry by television producer and executive Wenda Fong, publicist Fritz Friedman, and film producer and executive Chris Lee. The organization had few members when it was founded, as there were very few Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who were very visible in the media. However, since its founding, CAPE has grown to support both new and established actors, writers, directors, producers, agents, and executives. Despite starting small, the CAPE community mobilized through volunteer efforts, and their educational programs and opportunities have helped members develop their careers in the entertainment industry by connecting them to the tools they need to enhance their careers. Additionally, CAPE has been working on developing connections with US and International film industries of China, India, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines.\n\nIn 2009, CAPE hired its first Executive Director, Jennifer Sanderson. In 2014, CAPE moved from being a paid membership-driven organization to a mission-driven organization. The organization decided that in order to fulfill its original goals of serving the AAPI community, they needed to open up their resources to be available to anyone who needed to access them.\n\nIn December 2014, Jennifer Sanderson officially stepped down. In 2015, Michelle K. Sugihara took helm and is currently CAPE's Executive Director.\n\nIn October 2016, CAPE celebrated its 25th Anniversary.

{"id": "11091078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11091078", "title": "Dragon Ball", "text": "Dragon Ball\n\n, sometimes styled as \"Dragonball\", is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 \"tankōbon\" volumes by its publisher Shueisha. \"Dragon Ball\" was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\". The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, Son Goku, from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.\n\nToriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\", which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 19 animated feature films and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled \"Dragon Ball GT\" (1996–1997) and \"Dragon Ball Super\" (2015–2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of \"Dragon Ball Z\" aired in Japan under the title \"Dragon Ball Kai\", as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with several collections of soundtracks and a large number of video games. , the franchise has generated over in merchandise sales. \"Dragon Ball\" is one of the top ten highest-grossing media franchises of all time, as of 2018.\n\nSince its release, \"Dragon Ball\" has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 159million copies in Japan and over 350million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series in history. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing \"Dragon Ball\" as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly \"Dragon Ball Z\", is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.\n\nAkira Toriyama loosely modeled \"Dragon Ball\" on the classic Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\"; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 one-shot manga \"Dragon Boy\". He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan, as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of \"Journey to the West\", but with \"a little kung fu.\" Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films such as \"Enter the Dragon\" and \"Drunken Master\" in particular.\n\nSince it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed \"Dragon Ball\" at readers older than those of his previous serial \"Dr. Slump\". He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in \"Dr. Slump\", deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought. The island where the is held is modeled after Bali, which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.\nDuring the early chapters of the manga Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain, so to combat this he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first Tenkaichi Budōkai began that \"Dragon Ball\" truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in \"Dr. Slump\". Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game \"Spartan X\", in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.\n\nOnce Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the ; and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\" Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger. He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.\n\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of \"Dragon Ball\" most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku. Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings. Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use. Since the completion of \"Dragon Ball\", Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.\n\nDuring the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because \"Dragon Ball\" is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an \"unconventional and contradictory\" story. In 2013, commenting on \"Dragon Ball\"s global success, Toriyama said, \"Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.\", \"The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.\"\n\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, \"Dragon Ball\" was serialized in the manga anthology \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from December 3, 1984 to June 5, 1995, when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing. The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 \"tankōbon\" volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985 through August 4, 1995. Between December 4, 2002 and April 2, 2004, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 34 \"kanzenban\" volumes, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" run. The February 2013 issue of \"V Jump\", which was released in December 2012, announced that parts of the manga will be fully colored and re-released in 2013. Twenty volumes, beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013 and July 4, 2014. Twelve volumes covering the first 194 chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016. A \"sōshūhen\" edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" with color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, was published in eighteen volumes between May 13, 2016 and January 13, 2017.\n\nAnother manga penned by Ōishi, the three-chapter \"\" that revolves around Bardock, Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine \"V Jump\" from August and October 2011.\n\nThe final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series \"Jaco the Galactic Patrolman\" revealed that it is set before \"Dragon Ball\", with several characters making appearances. \"Jaco\" collected volumes contain a bonus \"Dragon Ball\" chapter depicting Goku's mother.\n\nIn December 2016, a spin-off manga titled \"Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha\" began in Shueisha's \"Shōnen Jump+\" digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the \"Dragon Ball\" manga.\n\nToriyama also created a short series, \"Neko Majin\" (1999–2005), that became a self-parody of \"Dragon Ball\". In 2006, a crossover between \"Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo\" (or \"Kochikame\") and \"Dragon Ball\" by Toriyama and \"Kochikame\" author Osamu Akimoto appeared in the manga. That same year, Toriyama teamed up with Eiichiro Oda to create a crossover chapter of \"Dragon Ball\" and \"One Piece\" titled \"Cross Epoch\".\n\n\"Dragon Ball\", \"Dragon Ball Z\", and \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" are all adaptations of the manga, with various new material added in to make extra episodes so that Toriyama would have more time to write original chapters for them to adapt. \"Dragon Ball GT\" and \"Dragon Ball Heroes\" are not originated from any direct source material from Toriyama, being fully created by their respective animation studios. \"Dragon Ball Super\" was released parallel to (and many times ahead of) the manga of the same name, due to the fact that they were both based on the same outline by Toriyama for the story of \"Super\".\n\nToei Animation produced an anime television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled \"Dragon Ball\". The series premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 19, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.\n\nInstead of continuing the anime as \"Dragon Ball\", Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996. Two television specials based on the \"Z\" series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, \"The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~\", renamed \"\" by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, \"Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks\", renamed \"\" by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.\n\n\nIn February 2009, \"Dragon Ball Z\" celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version under the name . The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story. The episodes were remastered for HDTV, with rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV. \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues. The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\".\n\n premiered on Fuji TV on February 7, 1996 and ran until November 19, 1997 for 64 episodes. Unlike the first two anime series, it is not based on Akira Toriyama's original \"Dragon Ball\" manga, being created by Toei Animation as a sequel to the series or as Toriyama called it, a \"grand side story of the original \"Dragon Ball.\"\" Toriyama designed the main cast, the spaceship used in the show, the design of three planets, and came up with the title and logo. In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\" anime. The television special episode, \"Goku's Side Story! The Proof of his Courage is the Four-Star Ball\", or \"\" as Funimation titled it for their dub, aired on March 26, 1997, between episodes 41 and 42, serving as a kind of precursor to the epilogue to the series shown at the end of episode 64.\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Toei Animation announced , the first all-new \"Dragon Ball\" television series to be released in 18 years. It debuted on July 5 and ran as a weekly series at 9:00 am on Fuji TV on Sundays until its series finale on March 25, 2018 after 131 episodes. Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Goku, Gohan, and Goten. Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well. Kouichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also reprise their roles, as Beerus and Whis, respectively.\n\nThe story of the anime is set four years after the defeat of Majin Boo, when the Earth has become peaceful once again. Akira Toriyama is credited as the original creator, as well for \"original story & character design concepts.\" It is also being adapted into a parallel manga.\n\nIn 2018, an anime to promote the \"Dragon Ball Heroes\" card and video game series was announced with a July 1 premiere. The series' announcement included a brief synopsis:Trunks returns from the future to train with Goku and Vegeta. However, he abruptly vanishes. The mysterious man \"Fu\" suddenly appears, telling them that Trunks has been locked up on the \"Prison Planet\", a mysterious facility in an unknown location between universes. The group searches for the Dragon Balls to free Trunks, but an unending super battle awaits them! Will Goku and the others manage to rescue Trunks and escape the Prison Planet?\n\nThe short film \"\" was created for the Jump Super Anime Tour, which celebrated \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" 40th anniversary, and debuted on September 21, 2008. A short animated adaptation of Naho Ōishi's Bardock spinoff manga, \"\", was shown on December 17–18, 2011 at the Jump Festa 2012 event.\n\nA two-episode original video animation (OVA) titled \"\" was created in 1993 as strategy guides for the Famicom video game of the same name. A remake titled \"\" was created as a bonus feature for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game \"\", which was released on November 11, 2010.\n\nA two-part hour-long crossover special between \"Dragon Ball Z\", \"One Piece\" and \"Toriko\", referred to as \"Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!\" aired on April 7, 2013.\n\nNineteen animated theatrical films based on the \"Dragon Ball\" series have been released in Japan. The two most recent films, \"\" (2013) and \"\" (2015), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.); these two have a greater sense of continuity with the series than the older films, especially since their storylines were directly adapted into the first-two story arcs of the \"Dragon Ball Super\" anime. They're also the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production. The 1996 feature film, \"\", with a running time of 80 minutes was produced to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the anime and is a re-imagining of the first arc of the series.\n\nAll films preceding these three were usually below feature length (around 45–60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than an episode of the TV series, this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. These films are also mostly alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs (like \"The Path to Power\") or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along with \"The Path to Power\", are based on the original \"Dragon Ball\" anime series. The remaining fifteen films are based on \"Dragon Ball Z\". The first five films were shown at the , while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the .\n\nAn American live-action film titled \"Dragonball Evolution\" was produced by 20th Century Fox, after it acquired the feature film rights to the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise in March 2002, previous to the film, two unofficial live-action films have been produced decades prior. The film was directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, it was released in the United States on April 10, 2009. The film was meant to lead into sequels,\nwhich were cancelled, after the film released and became universally heralded as one of the worst adaptations of all time, being considered by the fans as being unfaithful to the source material. Franchise creator Akira Toriyama also criticized the film adding he was completely left out of the creative process, despite having himself offered to help, going as far as saying: \"the result was a movie, I couldn't even call \"Dragon Ball\"\". Years after its release, the writer of the film, Ben Ramsey, released a public apology in which he admitted to have written the film \"chasing for a payday\" instead of \"as a fan of the franchise\".\n\nWith the news of 20th Century Fox selling itself, it's assets; which include the film rights to the \"Dragonball\" franchise, will now be owned by it's purchaser, Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n\"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4D\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2016.

A few years later fans started recreating the game. Today, \"Dragon Ball Online Global\" is a new, European version of \"Dragon Ball Online\" and it is being developed, while open beta server is running.\n\nMyriad soundtracks were released in the anime, movies and the games. The music for the first two anime \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Z\" and its films was composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi, while the music from \"GT\" was composed by Akihito Tokunaga and the music from \"Kai\" was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Norihito Sumitomo.

The first of these, \"Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations\" (\"Daizenshuu\" volume 1), first published in Japan in 1995, is the only one that was released in English, being printed in 2008 by Viz Media. It contains all 264 colored illustrations Akira Toriyama drew for the \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 \"tankōbon\". It also includes an interview with Toriyama on his work process. The remainder have never been released in English, and all are now out of print in Japan. From February 4 to May 9, 2013, condensed versions of the \"Daizenshuu\" with some updated information were released as the four-volume series. For \"Dragon Ball GT\", the \"Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files\" were released in May and December 1997 by Shueisha's \"Jump Comics Selection\" imprint. They include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 (accompanying the Japanese DVD release of \"Dragon Ball GT\") and this edition is still in print.\n\nCoinciding with the 34-volume \"kanzenban\" re-release of the manga, and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan, four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004. \"Dragon Ball Landmark\" and \"Dragon Ball Forever\" cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the \"kanzenban\" release, while and cover the \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\" anime, respectively. Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier \"Daizenshuu\" volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. \"Son Goku Densetsu\" in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Dragon Ball Kai\" in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume in 2009, covering the manga, and two-volume in 2010, covering the anime series. Despite the TV series airing during this time being \"Kai\", the \"Extreme Battle Collection\" books reference the earlier \"Z\" series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, ; a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented \"Complete Illustrations\", it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese \"Dragon Box\" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of \"Dragon Ball Kai\", released 2009 to 2011, come with a \"Dragon Book\" guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the \"Dragon Ball Z\" Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.\n\nCollectible cards based on the \"Dragon Ball\", \"Dragon Ball Z\", and \"Dragon Ball GT\" series have been released by Bandai. These cards feature various scenes from the manga and anime stills, plus exclusive artwork from all three series. Bandai released the first set in the United States in July 2008.\n\n\n\"Dragon Ball\" is one of the most popular manga series of all time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today. By 2000, more than 126million copies of its \"tankōbon\" volumes had been sold in Japan alone. It sold over 350million copies worldwide by 2007, and 150million copies in Japan by 2008, making it the best-selling manga ever at the time. By 2012, its sales in Japan had grown to pass 156million, making it the second best-selling \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" manga of all time, behind \"One Piece\". As of February 2014, \"Dragon Ball\" has sold 159.5million copies in Japan.\n\n\"Dragon Ball\" is credited as one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted \"Dragon Ball\" the third greatest manga of all time. In a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people, Son Goku, the main character of the franchise, ranked first place as the \"Strongest Manga Character of All Time.\" Goku's journey and his ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \"the admiration of young boys everywhere\". Manga artists, such as \"One Piece\" creator Eiichiro Oda and \"Naruto\" creator Masashi Kishimoto, have stated that Goku inspired their series' main protagonists as well as series structure.\n\nManga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that \"\"Dragon Ball\" is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every \"Shonen Jump\" artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\" He says the series \"turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga\", and its basic formula of \"lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes\" became the model for other shōnen series, such as \"Naruto\". Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity. James S. Yadao, author of \"The Rough Guide to Manga\", claims that the first several chapters of \"Dragon Ball \"\"play out much like \"Saiyuki\" with \"Dr. Slump\"-like humour built in\" and that \"Dr. Slump\", Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series. He feels the series \"established its unique identity\" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin, when the story develops \"a far more action-packed, sinister tone\" with \"wilder\" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance. Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters \"lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in \"Dr. Slump\" and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.\"\n\n\"Animerica\" felt the series had \"worldwide appeal\", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to \"maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans\". In \"Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture\", Takashi Murakami commented that \"Dragon Ball\" \"never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse.\" Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a \"chubby\" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts. Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. D. Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \"a superior humor title\". They praised Goku's innocence and Bulma's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series.\n\nThe content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, Toys \"R\" Us removed Viz's \"Dragon Ball\" from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had \"borderline soft porn\" after he bought them for his four-year-old son. Commenting on the issue, Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture. After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution. However, in 2001, after releasing three volumes censored, Viz announced \"Dragon Ball\" would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions. In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the \"Dragon Ball\" manga from their school district because it \"depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children.\"\n\nThe anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, \"Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way \"Dragon Ball Z\" has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.\" In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with \"Brutus\", a men's lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with \"Dragon Ball\" coming in fourth. TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, \"Dragon Ball\" came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll. On several occasions, the \"Dragon Ball\" anime has topped Japan's DVD sales. In the United States, the anime series has also sold over 25million DVD units by January 2012, and more than 30million DVD and Blu-ray units as of 2017. The anime films also drew a box office audience of 49million viewers by 2002.\n\nCarl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up \"Dragon Ball\" as \"an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure.\" Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub. However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of \"Dragon Ball Z\" over the years. Jeffrey Harris IGN criticized the voices including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender. Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development. Despite praising \"Dragon Ball Z\" for its cast of characters, they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights.\n\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting \"DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form.\" However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga. \"Dragon Ball Z\" was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series, and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in \"Wizard\" magazine's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list.\n\nHarris commented that \"Dragon Ball GT\" \"is downright repellent\", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the \"GT\" character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about \"GT\", mentioning that the fights from the series were \"a very simple childish exercise\" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of \"Dragon Ball GT\" has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.\n\nThe first episode of \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3, ahead of \"One Piece\" and behind \"Crayon Shin-chan\". Although following episodes had lower ratings, \"Kai\" was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run.\n\nIn 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as . In Japanese the numbers five and nine can be pronounced as \"Go\" and \"Ku\".\n\nThe producer of the \"Tekken\" video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that \"Dragon Ball\" was one of the first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced \"Tekken\" and other Japanese games such as \"Street Fighter\". Masaaki Ishikawa, art director of the video game \"Arms\", said that its art style was largely influenced by \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Akira\".\n\nIan Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series \"Steven Universe\", is a fan of \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dr. Slump\", and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own. He also stated that \"We're all big Toriyama fans on [\"Steven Universe\"], which kind of shows a bit.\" Additionally, Canadian mixed martial artist Carlos Newton dubbed his fighting style \"Dragonball Jiu-Jitsu\" in tribute to the series.\n\nAn unofficial Roblox spin-off of the series, \"Dragon Ball Bloxy\" and \"Dragon Ball Bloxy: World Tournament,\" was uploaded on Youtube in 2018.\n\nAn unofficial live-action Mandarin Chinese film adaptation of the series, \"\", was released in Taiwan in 1989. In December 1990, the unofficial live-action Korean film \"\" was released.\n\n"}
{"id": "53366398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53366398", "title": "Effects of sex in the media", "text": "Effects of sex in the media\n\nIn the past several decades, researchers have spent continuous efforts on exploring how sexual content in the media influence individuals' perceptions of sex, marriage, and rape. Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006. Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content.\n\nScholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, which sexual content portray rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, and genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or humiliation. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite.\n\nOne crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, \"the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography).\n\nSome researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials. Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to \"normal\" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than \"normal\" men.\nSince the Internet provides unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new. Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during the sexual intercourse.\n\nOne of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared. Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men. Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.\n\nDifferent people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves. It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women, while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it. Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.\n\nPersonality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did. Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies.\n\nBryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.\n\nCatharsis holds that \"vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and there by become less aggressive.\" This popular idea comes directly from psychodynamic models of personality. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense. However, very few empirical studies support the catharsis effect.\n\nDisinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.\n\nImitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that \"humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences\". Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.\n\nThe desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could in turn result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.\n\nHarris and Barlett concluded that a few studies have developed extensive pre-exposure training and/or post-exposure debriefing procedures to lessen the desensitizing effects. Linz found that by offering pertinent educational information about rape myths reduced the effect of desensitization, which means experimental participation can also help reduce the rape myth acceptance. Wilson, Linz, Donnerstein, and Stipp conducted a field experiment, they found that men who are older than 50 had preexisting attitudes reinforced and actually blamed women for rape after seeing the film. In other words, preexisting attitudes and personal experience should be considered when conducting research studies.\n\nAllen, Emmers, Gebhardt, and Giery concluded that experimental studies show positive significant effect between pornography exposure and rape myth acceptance, whereas correlational field studies how a very small effect or nonexistent effect. But the relationship consistently stronger when the sexual materials was violent than it was nonviolent.\n"}

By inventing and inserting documents that appear to be factual, an author tries to create a sense of authenticity beyond the normal and expected suspension of disbelief for a work of art. The goal of a false document is to convince an audience that what is being presented is factual.\n\nForged documents in business are typically for financial gain.\n\nA material's certification, essentially a report of its composition and properties, may be forged. A low-property material, produced for lower cost, may be passed as a higher-property material, which has a higher price. The difference becomes illicit profit. Counterfeit fasteners have low-strength alloys or inferior production processes, but are sold as high-strength fasteners.\n\nSimilarly, parts, systems, and processes for high-valued operations may have their quality-assurance documents forged. Substandard items may be cheaper or simply more readily available. Nuclear power plants in Japan and Korea have found components with forged safety documents.\n\"See also\": Information Assurance\n\nAcademic degrees often qualify for recruitment, promotions and additional pay. There are many methods to get false degree certificates. First, university officials have been bribed to issue a certificate without study. Second, false universities called diploma mills issue certificates that have no legal standing and are usually purchased outright without study, but they may still be legal. Finally, degree certificates have been directly forged, which is a felony in most jurisdictions. Besides the degree certificate itself, final theses and essays have been falsified by e.g. plagiarism, ghost writing or inclusion of fake references. Thus, the degree certificate itself is genuine but it may be revoked.\n\nA forged document, the Zinoviev Letter, helped bring the downfall of the first Labour Government in Britain. Conspiracies within secret intelligence services have occurred more recently, leading Harold Wilson to put in place rules to prevent in the 1960s phone tapping of members of Parliament, for example.\n\n\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination, was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century.\n\nArtist JSG Boggs's life and work have been extensively explored by author and journalist Lawrence Weschler. Boggs draws currency with exceptional care and accuracy, but he only ever draws one side. He then attempts to buy things with the piece of paper upon which he has drawn the currency. His goal is to pass each bill for its face value in common transactions. He buys lunch, clothes, and lodging in this manner, and after the transactions are complete, his bills fetch many times their face value on the art market. Boggs does not make any money from the much larger art market value of his work, only from reselling the goods bought, the change and receipts and other such materials. He has been arrested in many countries, and there is much controversy surrounding his work.\n\nOrson Welles' \"F for Fake\" is a prime example of a film which is both about falsification (art forgery and the journalism surrounding art forgery) as well as having falsified moments within the film. The movie follows the exploits of a famous art forger, his biographer Clifford Irving, and the subsequent fake autobiography of Howard Hughes that Irving tries to publish. The issues of veracity and forgery are explored in the film, while at the same time, Welles tricks the audience by incorporating fake bits of narrative alongside the documentary footage.\n\nThere is a long history of producers creating tie-in material to promote and merchandise movies and television shows. Tie-in materials as far-ranging as toys, games, lunch boxes, clothing and so on have all been created and in some cases generate as much or more revenue as the original programming. One big merchandising arena is publishing. In most cases such material is not considered canon within the show's mythology; however, in some instances the books, magazines, etc. are specifically designed by the creators to be canonical. With the rise of the Internet, in-canon online material has become more prominent.\n\nThe following is a list of \"false document\" in-canon supplemental material:\nAdditionally, a set of trading cards was produced which are also canon.\n\nA number of hoaxes have involved false documents:\n\n\n"}

L. 109-9, 119 Stat. 218 (April 27, 2005), is a federal legislative act regarding copyright that became law in the United States in 2005. The Act consists of two subparts: the Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005, which increases penalties for copyright infringement, and the Family Home Movie Act of 2005, which permits the development of technology to \"sanitize\" potentially offensive DVD and VOD content. \n\nThe Family Entertainment and Copyright Act was introduced into the United States Senate (of the 109th United States Congress) on January 25, 2005 by Senator Orrin Hatch (R - Utah), and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 27, 2005.\n\nThe act provides theater owners and employees with both civil and criminal immunity for questioning suspected violators or detaining them while police are summoned.\n\nThis act, also known as the \"ART Act\", is targeted at preventing copyright infringement of movies and software. It specifically targets two activities: filming movies in a movie theater, and early release of movies and software before they become publicly available.\n\nIt permits preregistration of certain types of unpublished works if it determines that such works have a history of infringement prior to commercial distribution. The purpose of preregistration is related to potential litigation protection in view of the fact that it allows an infringement action to be brought before the authorized commercial distribution of a work and the work’s full-fledged registration. Preregistration makes possible—only upon full registration—for the copyright owner to receive statutory damages and attorneys’ fees in an infringement action. Works determined eligible for copyright preregistration are: motion pictures, sound recordings, musical compositions, literary works being prepared as books, computer programs (including videogames), and advertising or marketing photographs.\n\nAnyone who \"knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to transmit or make a copy of a ... protected work... from a performance of such work in a motion picture exhibition facility...\" may be imprisoned up to three years for a first time offender, and up to six years for a repeat offender, in addition to any fines that may be levied under the U.S. Criminal Code for copyright infringement. This could apply to merely taking a cell phone snapshot of a theatre screen.\n\nWith regard to unreleased works intended for public distribution (e.g., beta software or workprints), anyone who makes available a work that the copyright owner expects to distribute commercially, but is not yet distributed, shall be punished if the work is \"made available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution.\" First time offenders can get up to three years in jail, or five if they committed the offense for financial gain. Repeat offenders can get ten years if the offense was committed for financial gain. These penalties are in addition to any penalties for violating non-disclosure agreements or trade secret law.\n\nThis section is an exemption of liability allowing the creation of technology that can edit a DVD or transmitted movie on the fly (during playback) and thus present a censored version of that movie. This provision arose out of a lawsuit between \"ClearPlay\", a Salt Lake City-based company that markets DVD-sanitizing technology, and a number of Hollywood studios and directors. The ClearPlay technology allows a home consumer to screen out up to 14 different categories of objectionable content, such as drug use, sexual situations, or foul language. The act is codified in 17 U.S.C. 110(11)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "182053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182053", "title": "Gamer", "text": "Gamer\n\nA gamer is a person who plays interactive games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games, and skill-based card games, and who plays for usually long periods of time. In some countries, such as the UK, the term \"gaming\" can also refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional tabletop and digital forms. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube/Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs.\n\nIn the United States, the average video game player is 30 years old and has been playing video games for over 12 years. In the UK as of 2007, the average video game player was over 23 years old, had played video games for over 10 years, and spent around 11 hours a week playing video games. According to Pew Research Center, 49% percent of adults have played a video game at some point in their life. Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'\n\nA female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.\nAccording to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games. Usage of the term \"girl gamer\" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.\n\nAlthough men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a stereotype that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more casual games which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.\n\nA gaymer, or gay gamer, is a person within the group of people who identify themselves as LGBT (gay, bisexual, lesbian, or transgender) and have an active interest in video games. This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys, one in 2006, which noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure, and another in 2009, focusing on the content that gaymers expect in video games.\nThe gaymer community provides a \"safe place\" for LGBT gamers apart from the isolation they feel from both the heteronormative gaming community and the gay community. They also believe that as homosexuality in video games increase, there will be an increased normalization of homosexuality in general. \"Gaymers are the future of video games\" said Hamed Hosseini, who is married to Mahar Buar, in Valve's gaming convention.\n\nIt is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.\n\n\nProfessional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in competitions. A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly South Korea and China, professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than 100,000 a year. In 2006 Major League Gaming contracted several \"Halo 2\" players including Tom \"Tsquared\" Taylor and members of Team Final Boss with $250,000 USD yearly deals.\n\nA retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, retro games—older video games and arcade games. They may also be called \"classic gamers\" or \"old-school gamers\", which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via emulation, or on modern hardware via ports or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).\n\nA number of taxonomies have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.\n\nThe Bartle taxonomy of player types classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\nThe MDA framework describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (\"Mechanics\"), how they build up during game to develop the gameplay (\"Dynamics\"), and what emotional response they convey to the player (\"Aesthetics\"). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. Jesse Schell extends this classification with Anticipation, Schadenfreude, Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.\n\nAn avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a pseudonym) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support, or at electronic sport conventions.\n\nSimilarly, a \"clan tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans. They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another. Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other. A \"team tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team. Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation. These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\nA clan, squad or guild is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator. Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of professional gamers, who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly performativity of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody. These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books. According to Graeme Kirkpatrick, the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with gameplay. Escapist founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"cinemaphile\".\nPeople who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify. Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.\n\nIn August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named Gamergate controversy. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. The Gamergate controversy concerns issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the Twitter hashtag #GamerGate. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.\n\nGames are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time. This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly. Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms. Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics. Market penetration of smartphones with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience, since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.\n\nWhile 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers. This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female PC gamers in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers. Connotations of \"gamer\" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.\n\nRacial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of hispanics identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of African-Americans and 7% of whites. The competitive fighting game scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant. This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a quarter. Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.\n\nCasualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly. Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of gameplay in established genres and franchises. Compared to seminal titles like \"DOOM\", more recent mass-market action games like the Call of Duty series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of interactive movies. The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in retro games but missing from new releases.\n\nThe trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game. According to Brendan Keogh, these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity. Belying these trends, games including \"The Sims\" or \"Minecraft\" have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex. According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are \"just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays \"Counter-Strike\"\" Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.\n\n"}
{"id": "15131007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15131007", "title": "Girls Gone Wild (franchise)", "text": "Girls Gone Wild (franchise)\n\nGirls Gone Wild (GGW) is an exhibitionist entertainment franchise created by Joe Francis in 1997, who occasionally appears as the host of the videos.\n\nThe eponymous company \"Girls Gone Wild\" was known for its early use of direct-response marketing techniques, including its late-night infomercials that began airing in 1997. The videos typically involve camera crews at party locations engaging young college-aged women who expose their bodies or act \"wild\", especially during Spring break. Since 2008, the Girls Gone Wild products have been sold primarily through their website as streaming videos, downloads, and DVDs.\n\nIn February 2013, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe first Girls Gone Wild film was released in 1997. In 2001 the company sold 4.5 million videos and DVDs. By the end of 2002, the company had produced 83 different titles and had begun airing 30-minute infomercials on E! Entertainment Television, Fox Sports Net, BET, Comedy Central, Tech TV, Style, and all other major U.S. networks. The infomercials targeted a late-night channel-surfing demographic that Joe Francis had identified in the late 90s. According to TNS Media Intelligence, Girls Gone Wild spent more than $21 million in advertising in 2003, becoming the largest advertiser for programs on the E! channel. In 2008, Francis' net worth was approximately $150 million.\n\nInstances of Girls Gone Wild in popular culture include the appearance of Eminem and Snoop Dogg in the company's videos, MGM’s announcement in 2002 that it would release a feature-length film based on the Girls Gone Wild concept, as well as various references and parodies of the show in popular television series and movies. In Season 4, Episode 8 of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" Wandering Bear, aired 29 Feb 2004, Larry and Jeff decide to buy a \"Girls Gone Wild\" video tape, and that lands them both in the hot seat with Larry's secretary and Jeff's wife after the dog leaves the house during the viewing of the tape.\n\nMost Girls Gone Wild videos follow a common formula in which a film crew interacts with a large crowd of people either at a party, club, or other event. Women willingly take off their clothes, engage in sexual activities, or participate in wet T-shirt contests. Compensation for taking part in a Girls Gone Wild video often consists of a free hat, T-shirt, or money. Occasionally, participants are invited to be filmed on a Girls Gone Wild tour bus.\n\nAt its inception, Girls Gone Wild marketed its product, namely videos, through direct-distribution channels such as infomercials, pay-per-view, and video on demand. This distribution was followed in 2008 by the launch of a Girls Gone Wild magazine, a clothing line, and a compilation record released on Jive Records.\n\nIn September 2005, Girls Gone Wild announced that it would donate all proceeds of Mardi Gras–themed DVDs and videos to the Red Cross. Proceeds from the video sales, which included a title featuring Snoop Dogg, were intended to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIn 2004, Girls Gone Wild began soliciting men for participation in their videos. \"Guys Gone Wild\" was a video series and male analogue of \"Girls Gone Wild\" targeted at young women.. These video tapes and DVDs featured much the same content as the \"Girls\" equivalent, only instead showing young men performing for the camera—e.g., in the shower, playing football naked, etc.\n\nIn an article, Bill Horn, spokesman for Mantra Entertainment which produced the videos, notes a gender-related double standard in these videos. In the \"Girls Gone Wild\" series, sometimes the young women kiss, while the guys' series does not have that feature. Horn explains: \"Let's face it, there's a double standard when it comes to guy-on-guy as opposed to girl-on-girl. It's sexy to see two girls making out. It's not considered sexy to see two guys making out. That's just the reality, and, we were there to capture the reality.\"\n\nThe hour-long \"Guys Gone Wild\" productions featured women camera operators who encouraged men to get naked and perform strip teases.\n\nIn 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against Girls Gone Wild alleging that the company failed to notify customers when they purchased subscriptions under a continuity program, rather than single DVDs. In 2004, GGW settled for $1.1 million and agreed to disclose all terms and get consent for recurring charges.\n\nIn 2006, Girls Gone Wild marketer MRA Holdings pleaded guilty to charges for failing to record filmed subject's ages in 2002 and 2003. The parties agreed to pay $2.1 million in restitution and fines.\n\nIn 2008, Ashley Dupré filed against Joe Francis and other defendants claiming that they filmed her without consent.\nDupré dropped the suit after Francis released footage of her consent.\n\nIn 2008, a Missouri woman claimed that she was filmed without consent when a Girls Gone Wild contractor removed her halter top at a St. Louis bar. A jury found that she consented. On re-trial, a judge awarded the woman $5.77 million after the defense failed to show at court. On appeal, the judge upheld the verdict.\n\nIn March 2008, four women claimed that they suffered emotional distress by being shown in Girls Gone Wild film. In April 2011, an all-female jury declined to award damages to the plaintiffs.\n\nIn 2013, GGW Brands LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n"}

{"id": "10332988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10332988", "title": "Joke theft", "text": "Joke theft\n\nJoke theft is the act of performing and taking credit for comic material written by another person without their consent. This is a form of plagiarism and can, in some cases, be copyright infringement. \nIn music halls and vaudeville, it was common for performers to \"borrow\" material. According to Milton Berle, etiquette only required that \"the borrower add to the joke and make it his own\". At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian.\nBerle and Bob Hope had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes. Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title \"The Thief of Bad Gag\".\n\nEven the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. Bill Cosby admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase \"little tiny hairs\". Many years later, Carlos Mencia performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album \"\".\n\nIn the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.\n\nRobin Williams was accused of stealing material from another comic. David Brenner claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.\n\nFor many years, Denis Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album \"No Cure For Cancer\", he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result. At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude. As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from pancreatic cancer, an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; \"Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer\").\n\nIn a 2008 appearance on \"The Opie and Anthony Show\", comedian Louis C.K. claimed that Leary stole his \"I'm an asshole\" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary. On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.\n\nIn his memoir \"Gasping for Airtime\", Jay Mohr admitted that he lifted an entire routine from Rick Shapiro's act for a 1995 \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.\n\nLouis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with Dane Cook over three bits on Cook's album, \"Retaliation\", that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album \"Live in Houston\". C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series \"Louie\".\n\nGeorge Lopez has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism. However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it.\n\nIn 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused by anonymous bloggers of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Eddie Izzard, Chris Rock, Bill Hicks and Robert Schimmel. However, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a \"nugget\" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a \"treasure hunt\". He says he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against La7 broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show \"Decameron\", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation.) He calls this ruse \"the Lenny Bruce trick\" (named for the comic of same name). Luttazzi asserts that the jokes he references are not \"plagiarized\" but \"calqued\", which is a fair use of original material. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not \"plagiarised\" ones.\n\nIn 2011, \"Australia's Got Talent\" contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals. However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians Lee Mack and Geoff Keith. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well – \"I just sacked my two writers – Copy and Paste\" – had been done in 2009 by comedian Jeffrey Ross, about Brad Garrett, at a roast of Joan Rivers. Ross had said, \"This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste.\"\n\nIn January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the social networking site Facebook for stealing jokes and stories from comedian Doug Stanhope and posting them to his blog from 2010, claiming them as his own work, including Stanhope's \"Fuck someone uglier than you\" routine, which was found on Stanhope's \"Acid Bootleg\". Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details, causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the \"Occupy Troy Holm\" Movement. Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that \"To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that \"isn't\" mine?\"\n\nJoke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.\nDick Cavett wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by Earl Wilson which attributed the joke to Rip Taylor. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics.\n\nCavett and Woody Allen often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows \"The Red Skelton Show\" and \"Laugh In\". This proved extremely painful to Allen.\n\nSeveral episodes of \"The Simpsons\", including \"\", \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\" and \"The Italian Bob\" have poked fun at \"Family Guy\", implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from the Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.\n\nIn 2017 the Australian television show host Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme \"The Grill Team\", which is on 2MMM. In the interview, \"The Grill Team\"s co-host Matty Johns told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game \"Test Match\". Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\", which is on KIIS 106.5. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about \"Test Match\", passing it off as his own.\n\nThere is, historically, very little legal recourse taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. W. C. Fields reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken.\n\n\"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy,\" said comedian David Brenner. \"If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere – and what I just said is original.\"\n\nAccording to a 2018 study in the \"American Sociological Review\", \"most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery\". The study argues:\"that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes’ similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem.\"\n"}
{"id": "288001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288001", "title": "Kanon (visual novel)", "text": "Kanon (visual novel)\n\nFollowing the game's release, \"Kanon\" made several transitions into other media. Two manga series were serialized in \"Dengeki Daioh\" and \"Dragon Age Pure\". Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. Toei Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2003. Kyoto Animation produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films in 2008, but the license was given to Funimation after ADV's closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between \"Kanon\" and the musical term canon by using Pachelbel's \"Kanon D-dur\", or \"Canon in D major\", as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.\n\n\"Kanon\" is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. \"Kanon\" follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nThere are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for \"Kanon\", commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of \"Kanon\"'s influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on \"Kanon\" who thought that.\n\nIn the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of \"Kanon\" without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene in each of the five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in \"Kanon\" are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.\n\nThere are several important locations featured in the \"Kanon\" story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically over the course of the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The shopping district is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.\n\nThere are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the episode titles from the 2006–2007 anime have parts in their titles related to music, such as overture and introit. Miracles play a large part in the story; \"Kanon\"s plot line and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur. The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story. Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with four of them when he used to visit the city as a kid.\n\nOne of the motifs in the story is amnesia, or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this is used as a plot device to advance the story. Another motif deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. \"Newtype USA\" stated in an article on \"Kanon\" that \"it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive\", despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series. These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai).\n\nThe player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa, the protagonist of \"Kanon\". He is a cynical 17-year-old high school student, and is known to play jokes on the girls his age he knows and interacts with throughout the story. Despite this, Yuichi is very loyal and will go to great lengths to please others, even at the expense of his own time and money. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. Ayu Tsukimiya, the main heroine of \"Kanon\", is a short, strange, and mysterious girl immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red hair band, and tendency to refer to herself with the masculine first-person pronoun . She has a fondness for eating taiyaki, and is notorious for her catchphrase, , which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, pain, and fear. Yuichi's first cousin Nayuki Minase, another of \"Kanon\"'s heroines, has been in love with him since childhood, and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall in love with one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her, and has constant trouble waking up in the morning except on a few occasions when she is up before Yuichi, much to his surprise.\n\nYuichi is accosted a few days after arriving in the city by \"Kanons third heroine Makoto Sawatari, a young girl who has lost her memories, but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever. Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in \"Kanon\" is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she \"punishes\" someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.\n\n\"Kanon\"s story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to \"Kanon\"'s beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.\n\nOn the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is reluctant to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.\n\nAnother girl who is connected to Yuichi's past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat demons at night while the school is deserted. Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts to talk with her more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her.\n\nMost of \"Kanon\"s development staff originally worked for the visual novel publisher Nexton under the brand Tactics. After the release of the brand's third game \"\", most of Tactics' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game. Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at VisualArt's once before, introduced Key's founding members to the president of VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998 and started production on \"Kanon\". The planning for the visual novel was headed by Naoki Hisaya who was also one of two scenario writers with Jun Maeda. Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design and computer graphics. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Dinn, Miracle Mikipon, Shinory—and background art was provided by Torino. The music in the game was composed by OdiakeS, Shinji Orito and Jun Maeda. \"Kanon\" was the first and last visual novel developed by Key that two of the main staff—Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS—worked on before pursuing a similar line of work in other visual novel studios.\n\n\"Kanon\" was released as an adult game on June 4, 1999 in limited and regular editions, playable on a Windows PC as a CD-ROM. The limited edition came bundled with the remix album \"Anemoscope\" remixing background music tracks featured in the visual novel. Key released an all ages version on January 7, 2000 for Windows. An updated adult version called the \"Kanon Standard Edition\" was released on November 26, 2004 with added support for Windows 2000/XP as a DVD-ROM. The \"Standard Edition\" incorporates the extra graphics added to the earlier all ages version of the game, and other technical changes such as more save slots. An all ages version of the \"Standard Edition\" was released on January 28, 2005. An updated all ages version of \"Kanon\" compatible for Windows Vista PCs was released by Key on July 31, 2009 in a box set containing five other Key visual novels called Key 10th Memorial Box. Another all ages updated version compatible for Windows 7 PCs called \"Kanon Memorial Edition\" was released on April 30, 2010.\n\nThe first consumer console port of the game was released for the Dreamcast on September 14, 2000 by NEC Interchannel. A PlayStation 2 (PS2) version was released on February 28, 2002 also by NEC Interechannel. The PS2 version was re-released as a \"Best\" version on December 22, 2004. The PS2 version was bundled in a \"Key 3-Part Work Premium Box\" package together with the PS2 versions of \"Air\" and \"Clannad\" released on July 30, 2009. An adult version playable as a Blu-ray Disc was released on December 16, 2011 by Asoberu! BD-Game, a brand of VisualArt's.\n\nA PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of the game was released in Japan on February 15, 2007 by Prototype. The first release of the PSP version came with a special DVD featuring a message from five of the voice actors and a recompiled opening video from the video game version. The five voice actors on the DVD included: Mariko Kōda as Nayuki Minase, Akemi Satō as Shiori Misaka, Mayumi Iizuka as Makoto Sawatari, Yūko Minaguchi as Akiko Minase, and Tomokazu Sugita as Yuichi Aizawa. Yui Horie as Ayu Tsukimiya voiced the short introduction of the DVD, but was not featured in the contents of the DVD itself. A downloadable version of the PSP release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on November 9, 2009. A version playable on FOMA and SoftBank 3G mobile phones was released by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto in May 2007. A version playable on Android devices was released on November 30, 2011. A version playable on iOS devices was released on April 4, 2013. In the original release, there was no voice acting for the characters, but in the later versions produced for the Dreamcast and PS2, full voice acting was included. The only exception was Yuichi, who was not voiced in either version. However, the PSP release features voice acting for Yuichi, provided by Tomokazu Sugita.\n\nFive adult light novels written by Mariko Shimizu and published by Paradigm were released in Japan between October 1999 and August 2000. The cover art and internal illustrations were drawn by Itaru Hinoue, the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first two released were and in December 1999. The third was released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was titled \"The Fox and the Grapes\" (Makoto), released two months later. The final novel titled was released in August 2000. Paradigm re-released the five novels in conjunction with VisualArt's under their VA Bunko imprint, which removed the erotic scenes, starting with \"Yuki no Shōjo\" on June 27, 2009, and ending with \"Hidamari no Machi\" on December 26, 2009. To make up for the missing erotic content, Shimizu wrote additional content for each volume. A sixth novel titled for the supporting character Sayuri Kurata written by Shimizu and illustrated by Zen was released on March 31, 2011.\n\nA set of five drama CDs were released between September 29, 2000 and April 27, 2001, with each volume focusing on a different heroine. A set of five anthology drama CDs were released between December 22, 2001 and May 25, 2002, with each volume again focusing on a different heroine. A radio show to promote the Dreamcast port of \"Kanon\" titled broadcast 13 episodes between October 6 and December 29, 2000. The show, produced by Movic, was hosted by Yukari Tamura and Tomoko Kawakami, the voices Mai Kawasumi and Sayuri Kurata, respectively. A radio drama titled broadcast 53 episodes between October 6, 2001 and October 5, 2002. The show, which was broadcast on TBS Radio and Radio Kansai, was hosted by Yūko Minaguchi, the voice of Akiko Minase, and narrated by Atsushi Kisaichi. The voice actors from \"Kanon\" were also featured as guests. Five CD compilation volumes containing all of the show's broadcasts were released between August 30, 2002 and April 26, 2003.\n\nThe first \"Kanon\" manga illustrated by Petit Morishima was serialized in MediaWorks' manga magazine \"Dengeki Daioh\" between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate \"tankōbon\" volumes published by MediaWorks under their \"Dengeki Comics\" imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002. There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume one and the epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in. The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely. This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story.\n\nThe second manga illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki, under the main title with the subtitle \"each regret of Kanon\", was serialized between volumes two and seven of Fujimi Shobo's \"Dragon Age Pure\" magazine sold between June 29, 2006 and October 20, 2007, respectively. The first volume was released in Japan on April 1, 2007 and focused on Nayuki's story. The second volume was released on December 8, 2007 and focused on the other four heroines. There are nine chapters in total, five in volume one and four in volume two.\n\nThere have also been many releases of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title \"Kanon Comic Anthology\", was released in November 2000 under their \"DNA Media Comics\" label. Volumes for this series continued to be released for another two years, ending in December 2002 with the 14th volume; an additional 15th volume was released later in February 2007. Ichijinsha also released two more volumes of anthology collections of four-panel comic strips titled \"Kanon 4-koma Kings\" in April and June 2001. Softgarage released an anthology in a single volume in December 2002 titled \"Kanon Anthology Comic\". In April 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both \"Kanon\" and \"Air\" titled \"Haru Urara: Kanon & Air\".\n\nBetween June and August 2004, Ohzora also released five separate volumes of manga based on \"Kanon\" drawn by five separate artists. Ohzora later collected some of the previously published manga anthologies into two volumes titled \"Kanon Anthology Comics Best Selection\" released in December 2006 and January 2007. Additionally, Ohzora released another 13 volumes of an anthology series titled \"Kanon\" under their \"Twin Heart Comics\" label. The now-bankrupt publisher Raporto also released 21 manga anthology volumes titled \"Kanon\" under their \"Raporto Comics\" label between November 2000 and October 2002. The last manga anthology, a collection of four-panel comic strips released in a single volume by Enterbrain titled \"Magi-Cu 4-koma Kanon\", was released in January 2007 under their \"MC Comics\" label. Each of the anthology series are written and drawn by an average of 20 people per volume.\n\nThe first \"Kanon\" anime was produced by the Japanese animation studio Toei Animation and directed by Naoyuki Itō. Thirteen episodes were produced and aired in Japan on Fuji TV between January 31 and March 28, 2002. The series also later aired on Kansai TV. Later, a single original video animation (OVA) episode titled \"Kanon Kazahana\" was released in March 2003. The anime series and OVA used the songs \"Florescence\" and \"Flower\" for the opening and ending themes, respectively. While it does not appear as the ending theme in the first 12 episodes or in the OVA, the game's ending theme \"Where the Wind Reaches\" is used as the ending theme for the series in episode 13. Additionally, the game's opening theme \"Last regrets\" is played near the end of episode 13 during the flashback scene.\n\nStarting in 2006, Kyoto Animation, the animators of another Key game-turned-anime, \"Air\", decided to animate a new adaptation of \"Kanon\". This version, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara and written by Fumihiko Shimo, aired between October 5, 2006 and March 15, 2007 on BS-i, containing 24 episodes. The series was later rebroadcast on TBS. ADV Films announced on September 21, 2007 at the Anime Weekend Atlanta anime convention that they have officially licensed the second \"Kanon\" anime series. ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been spread on the Internet. The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at Anime News Network between December 23 and December 30, 2007. In July 2008, the licensing rights of the second \"Kanon\" anime were transferred from ADV to Funimation Entertainment who continued to produce the series in North America.\n\nThe second TV \"Kanon\" animation features updated animation quality, and uses the same voice acting cast as the first anime, with the exception of Yuichi and Kuze. Unlike the first anime, the actual theme songs from the \"Kanon\" game are used for the second anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode 16 that did not come from the visual novel titled \"Last regrets (X'mas floor style)\" by Eiko Shimamiya from I've Sound's first album \"Regret\". Other songs are used from the arrange albums released over the years, which include \"Anemoscope\", \"Recollections\", \"Re-feel\", and \"Ma-Na\".\n\nThe visual novel has two main theme songs, the opening theme \"Last regrets\", and the ending theme , both sung by Ayana. The lyrics for both songs were written by Jun Maeda, and arranged by Kazuya Takase of I've Sound. The five heroines have leitmotifs. Ayu's theme is ; Nayuki's theme is ; Makoto's theme is \"The Fox and the Grapes\"; Shiori's theme is ; lastly, Mai's theme is .\n\nThe first music album released was \"Anemoscope\" which came bundled with the original release of \"Kanon\" in June 1999. The next release was a single, \"Last regrets/Place of wind which arrives\", which contained the opening and ending themes plus arranged versions of three background music tracks and a male vocal version of the opening theme. A compilation album containing tracks from the two albums was released in December 2001 called \"Recollections\". The game's original soundtrack was released in October 2002 containing 22 different tracks along with short versions of the two theme songs. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called \"Re-feel\" which contained five tracks from \"Kanon\" and five from \"Air\". Excluding the first two albums, each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key's record label Key Sounds Label; this is due to the first two albums being released before the label was formed.\n\nThe first anime's first original soundtrack was released in May 2002, and a second followed in July 2002. The first anime's opening theme is \"Florescence\" and the ending theme is \"Flower\", both sung by Miho Fujiwara; the maxi single containing the anime's opening and ending themes was released in June 2002. An album containing music box arranged tracks of music from the first anime was released in July 2003 called \"Orgel de Kiku Sakuhin Shū\". The albums released for the first anime were produced by Frontier Works and Movic. A single was released in commemoration for the second anime called \"Last regrets/Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho\" which contained the game's original opening and ending themes in original, short, and remixed versions; the album was produced by Key Sounds Label.\n\nAccording to a national ranking of how well bishōjo games sold nationally in Japan, the original \"Kanon\" release for Windows achieved its highest rank at number two in the ranking. Three years later in June 2002, the original release ranked in again at 45, and then again at 46 the following two weeks. The original release also made the ranking after that at number 41 in early July 2002. The \"Kanon\" Standard Edition premiered at number 16 in the rankings. The \"Kanon\" Standard Edition remained on the top 50 list for the next two months, achieving the rankings of 47 and 35. The all ages version of the \"Kanon\" Standard Edition premiered at number 42 on the national ranking, went up to 35 the next month, and did not appear on the rankings after that. The Dreamcast port sold 42,379 units in the first week and was the fourth top selling console game in Japan for that week. \"Kanon\" has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms, not counting the PSP release.\n\nFive days before the first PS2 release for \"Kanon\", a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. \"Kanon\" was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being \"America Ōden Ultra Quiz\" from DigiCube and \"Marle de Jigsaw\" from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\" where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of \"Kanon\"'s story could be summed up as \"the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end,\" resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\", poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, \"Kanon\" ranked fifth with 71 votes.\n\nCharacters from \"Kanon\" have appeared in several dōjin games not directly based on the \"Kanon\" series such as the \"Eternal Fighter Zero\" game by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from \"Kanon\" or from \"\". The dōjin game \"Glove on Fight\" featured at least two \"Kanon\" characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a fighting style game along with various other characters taken from other media. The character Ayu Tsukimiya in particular is known to appear in works outside \"Kanon\", such as in strip 67 of the webcomic \"Megatokyo\" where Ayu is shown eating \"taiyaki\".\n\nThe second \"Kanon\" anime series was reviewed at Anime News Network where Theron Martin commented how the series is a \"formulaic moe haremfest\", and how the moe aspects of the series may make viewers \"feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness\". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of \"Air\", saying \"Like \"Air\", the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike \"Air\", however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny.\" Martin also compares \"Kanon\" to the anime adaptation of \"Shuffle!\" which is described as \"bombing\" where \"Kanon\" \"works\". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters \"endear[ing] themselves to the viewer...far better than what \"Shuffle!\"'s do.\" Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as a defining feature of the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it \"overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times\" causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being \"too erratic to be fully credible\" or easily believable. Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as \"one of the best moe-centric series to date\" and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making \"Kanon\" \"one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year\". Martin adds another series comparison, citing \"Kanon\" as the \"polar opposite of \"Gurren Lagann\"\", which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2653158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2653158", "title": "Kuso", "text": "Kuso\n\nKuso is the term used in East Asia for the internet culture that generally includes all types of camp and parody. In Japanese, means \"crap\" or \"shit\" and \"bullshit\", and is often uttered as an interjection. It is also used to describe outrageous matters and objects of poor quality. This definition of kuso was brought into Taiwan around 2000 by young people who frequently visited Japanese websites and quickly became an internet phenomenon, spreading to Taiwan and Hong Kong and subsequently to the rest of China. \n\nIn Chinese kuso is called \"e'gao\" (S: 恶搞, T: 惡搞, P: \"ègǎo\"), with the first character meaning \"evil\" or \"gross\" and the second meaning \"to make fun of [someone/something].\" In 2007 the word was so new that it was not listed in Chinese dictionaries.\nAccording to Christopher Rea, \"E’gao, the main buzzword associated with online Chinese parody, literally means “evil doings” or “malicious manipulation”\"; he notes that e'gao's \"semantic associations [to kuso] can be misleading, however, since e’gao is not fundamentally scatological—or even, as the Chinese term might suggest, malicious. In its broad usage, it may be applied to parody of any stripe, from fan tribute-mimicry to withering mockery. In a more restricted sense, it refers the practice of digitally manipulating mass culture products to comic effect and circulating them via the internet. The term e’gao may thus be interpreted in multiple senses, as it denotes variously a genre, a mode, a practice, an ethos and a culture.\"\n\nThe root of Taiwanese \"kuso\" was \"kuso-ge\" from Japan. The word \"kusoge\" is a clipped compound of \"kuso\" and \"gēmu\" (ゲーム, game), which means, quite literally, \"crappy (video) games.\" The introduction of such a category originally was to teach gamers how to appreciate and enjoy a game of poor quality—such as appreciating the games' outrageous flaws instead of becoming frustrated by them. This philosophy soon spread to Taiwan, where people would share the games and often satirical comments on BBSes. Games generally branded as kuso in Taiwan include \"Hong Kong 97\" and the \"Death Crimson\" series.\n\nBecause \"kuso-ge\"s were often unintentionally funny, soon the definition of kuso in Taiwan shifted to \"anything hilarious,\" and people started to brand anything outrageous and funny as kuso. Parodies, such as the Chinese robot Xianxingzhe ridiculed by a Japanese website, were marked as kuso. Mo lei tau films by Stephen Chow are often said to be kuso as well. The Cultural Revolution is often a subject of parody too, with songs such as \"I Love Beijing Tiananmen\" spread around the internet for laughs.\n\nSome, however, limit the definition of kuso to \"humour limited to those about Hong Kong comics or Japanese anime, manga, and games.\" Kuso by such definitions are primarily doujin or fanfiction. Fictional crossovers are common media for kuso, such as redrawing certain bishōjo anime in the style of \"Fist of the North Star\", or blending elements of two different items together. (For example, in \"Densha de D\", both \"Initial D\" and \"Densha de Go!\" are parodied, as Takumi races trains and drifts his railcar across multiple railway tracks.)\n\nIn China, earlier \"e gao\" works consisted of images edited in Adobe Photoshop. An example of this would be the Little Fatty internet meme.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7232405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7232405", "title": "Marriage plot", "text": "Marriage plot\n\nMarriage plot is a term used, often in academic circles, to categorize a storyline that recurs in novels most prominently and more recently in films. Until the expansion of the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, this plot centered exclusively on the courtship rituals between a man and a woman and the obstacles that faced the potential couple on its way to the nuptial payoff. The marriage plot became a popular source of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of the middle class novel. The foremost practitioners of the form include some of the more illustrious names in English letters, among them Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Brontë sisters.\n\nPost-1980 deconstructionist criticism has highlighted how the plot was a profitable publishing and ideological production that served to ensure the ascendancy of the middle class. The marriage plot was the liberal age's reformulation of the medieval romance, which excluded all but aristocratic ladies and their chivalrous knights from its epics of love. The marriage plot promises to liberate romance by making it available to greater sections of society: the middle class and to some extent, the working classes, who are relegated to comic relief in 16th- and 17th-century theater, suddenly become serious moral subjects. Today, few doubt the ennobling qualities of love, but giving that nobility of soul to anyone but nobles was an innovation to be found foundationally in the marriage plot, perhaps pioneered by Richardson's \"Pamela\", wherein a lowly but virtuous maid is raised beyond her birth through her insistent chastity and her subsequent marriage to the lordly Mr. B.\n\nFilm, which supplanted the novel as the most popular narrative form in the 20th century, did not abandon this innovation of the novel. Rather, the marriage plot has enjoyed a continued efflorescence, visible to this day in the popular film form known as the \"romantic comedy\". At its most formulaic, critics have asserted, the conventions of the marriage plot, with the cathartic closure that its marriage ending delivers to its believers, ultimately renounces politics and engagement in the world in favor of privacy and domestic bliss. We may see this, for instance, in the film \"You've Got Mail\", which resolves the political opposition between mega-bookstore boss Tom Hanks and bookshop-around-the-corner owner, Meg Ryan, by uniting its lead characters in a union that effaces the unequal distribution of capital that originally put them at odds.\n\n\n"}

The park was founded by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia () and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío (), and opened on 24 February 1995. It consists of two main areas: by the main entrance are the buildings housing the museum and exhibitions detailing the history, culture and process of growing and producing coffee in the region; and in the valley beyond is an amusement park with rides and shows. The two areas are linked by two gondola lifts and a chairlift: it is also possible to walk between the two areas via an ecological trail that passes through a plantation of many varieties of coffee bushes.\n\nAs well as amusement rides the park also offers other attractions such as animatronics shows, a global coffee garden, food stalls based on coffee and traditional Colombian architecture. In 2009 the park received its five millionth visitor and has grown to become one of Colombia's top tourist attractions, with more than one million visitors in 2017.\nThe idea for a coffee museum came after Diego Arango Mora and his wife Margarita visited the Sugar Museum in nearby Valle del Cauca Department. Margarita remarked that if the country had a museum dedicated to sugar, it should also have one dedicated to Colombia's best known export. Arango, a member of the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío, agreed and contacted Jorge Cárdenas Gutiérrez, the head of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, who was also receptive to the idea. When Arango was elected to chair the National Congress of Coffee Growers in 1982, he proposed the creation of the museum, but was told by the secretary of the Congress that he did not have the quorum to pass the proposal.\n\nOver the following years, Arango continued to work toward the creation of the museum, despite lack of financial support from banks unwilling to lend money for an enterprise they saw as non-profitable, and opposition from delegates from three other departments of Colombia who lobbied for the museum to be constructed in their departments, as well from other towns within the department of Quindío itself who objected to Arango's choice of Montenegro as the planned site for the museum.\n\nThe museum was finally constructed and opened on 24 February 1995, and drew 250,000 visitors in its first year. However, visitor surveys showed that it was mainly those of 40 years of age who enjoyed the park, while younger visitors and children indicated they would not return. Arango took the decision to add an amusement park to the museum in order to attract the younger crowds. The first attractions were the gondola lift and the steam railway, followed by the roller coaster and other rides.\n\n\n\nThe amusement park contains 27 rides as of 2018. These include three roller coasters:\n\nOther rides include free-fall rides, a log flume, a Ferris wheel, bumper boats and bumper cars (dodgems), go-karts and a traditional train (with live folkloric music onboard) and station\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22938", "title": "Performing arts", "text": "Performing arts\n\nPerforming arts are a form of art in which artists use their voices, bodies or inanimate objects to convey artistic expression. It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience.\n\nTheatre, music, dance and object manipulation, and other kinds of performances are present in all human cultures. The history of music and dance date to pre-historic times whereas circus skills date to at least Ancient Egypt. Many performing arts are performed professionally. Performance can be in purpose built buildings, such as theatres and opera houses, on open air stages at festivals, on stages in tents such as circuses and on the street.\n\nLive performances before an audience are a form of entertainment. The development of audio and video recording has allowed for private consumption of the performing arts.\n\nThe performing arts often aim to express one's emotions and feelings.\n\nArtists who participate in performing arts in front of an audience are called performers. Examples of these include actors, comedians, dancers, magicians, circus artists, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as songwriting, choreography and stagecraft.\n\nA performer who excels in acting, singing, and dancing is commonly referred to as a triple threat. Well-known examples of historical triple threat artists include Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, and Judy Garland.\n\nPerformers often adapt their appearance, such as with costumes and stage makeup, stage lighting, and sound.\n\nPerforming arts may include dance, music, opera, theatre and musical theatre, magic, illusion, mime, spoken word, puppetry, circus arts, performance art.\n\nThere is also a specialized form of fine art, in which the artists \"perform\" their work live to an audience. This is called performance art. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of props. Dance was often referred to as a \"plastic art\" during the Modern dance era.\n\nTheatre is the branch of performing arts; concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience, using a combination of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle. Any one or more of these elements is performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style of plays. Theatre takes such forms as plays, musicals, opera, ballet, illusion, mime, classical Indian dance, kabuki, mummers' plays, improvisational theatre, stand-up comedy, pantomime, and non-conventional or contemporary forms like postmodern theatre, postdramatic theatre, or performance art.\n\nIn the context of performing arts, dance generally refers to human movement, typically rhythmic and to music, used as a form of audience entertainment in a performance setting. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet.\n\nThere is one another modern form of dance that emerged in 19th- 20th century with the name of Free-Dance style. This form of dance was structured to create a harmonious personality which included features such as physical and spiritual freedom. Isadora Duncan was the first female dancer who argued about “woman of future” and developed novel vector of choreography using Nietzsche’s idea of “supreme mind in free mind”.\n\nDance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other.\n\nChoreography is the art of making dances, and the person who practices this art is called a choreographer.\n\nMusic is an art form which combines pitch, rhythm, and dynamic in order to create sound. It can be performed using a variety of instruments and styles and is divided into genres such as folk, jazz, hip hop, pop, and rock, etc. As an art form, music can occur in live or recorded formats, and can be planned or improvised.\n\nStarting in the 6th century BC, the Classical period of performing art began in Greece, ushered in by the tragic poets such as Sophocles. These poets wrote plays which, in some cases, incorporated dance (see Euripides). The Hellenistic period began the widespread use of comedy.\n\nHowever, by the 6th century AD, Western performing arts had been largely ended, as the Dark Ages began. Between the 9th century and 14th century, performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and morality plays, organized by the Church in celebration of holy days and other important events.\n\nIn the 15th century performing arts, along with the arts in general, saw a revival as the Renaissance began in Italy and spread throughout Europe plays, some of which incorporated dance, which were performed and Domenico da Piacenza credited with the first use of the term \"ballo\" (in \"De Arte Saltandi et Choreas Ducendi\") instead of \"danza\" (dance) for his \"baletti\" or \"balli\". The term eventually became \"Ballet\". The first Ballet \"per se\" is thought to be Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx's Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581).\nBy the mid-16th century Commedia Dell'arte became popular in Europe, introducing the use of improvisation. This period also introduced the Elizabethan masque, featuring music, dance and elaborate costumes as well as professional theatrical companies in England. William Shakespeare's plays in the late 16th century developed from this new class of professional performance.\n\nIn 1597, the first opera, Dafne was performed and throughout the 17th century, opera would rapidly become the entertainment of choice for the aristocracy in most of Europe, and eventually for large numbers of people living in cities and towns throughout Europe.\n\nThe introduction of the proscenium arch in Italy during the 17th century established the traditional theatre form that persists to this day. Meanwhile, in England, the Puritans forbade acting, bringing a halt to performing arts that lasted until 1660. After that, women began to appear in both French and English plays. The French introduced a formal dance instruction in the late 17th century.\n\nIt is also during this time that the first plays were performed in the American Colonies.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the introduction of the popular opera buffa brought opera to the masses as an accessible form of performance. Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni\" are landmarks of the late 18th century opera.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century, Beethoven and the Romantic movement ushered in a new era that led first to the spectacles of grand opera and then to the musical dramas of Giuseppe Verdi and the Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) of the operas of Richard Wagner leading directly to the music of the 20th century.\n\nThe 19th century was a period of growth for the performing arts for all social classes, technical advances such as the introduction of gaslight to theatres, burlesque, minstrel dancing, and variety theatre. In ballet, women make great progress in the previously male-dominated art.\nModern dance began in the late 19th century and early 20th century in response to the restrictions of traditional ballet.\n\nKonstantin Stanislavski's \"System\" revolutionized acting in the early 20th century, and continues to have a major influence on actors of stage and screen to the current day. Both impressionism and modern realism were introduced to the stage during this period.\n\nThe arrival of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes (1909–1929) revolutionized ballet and the performing arts generally throughout the Western world, most importantly through Diaghilev's emphasis on collaboration, which brought choreographers, dancers, set designers/artists, composers and musicians together to revitalize and revolutionize ballet. It is extremely complex.\n\nWith the invention of the motion picture in the late 19th century by Thomas Edison and the growth of the motion picture industry in Hollywood in the early 20th century, film became a dominant performance medium throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nRhythm and blues, a cultural phenomenon of black America, became to prominence in the early 20th century; influencing a range of later popular music styles internationally.\n\nIn the 1930s Jean Rosenthal introduced what would become modern stage lighting, changing the nature of the stage as the Broadway musical became a phenomenon in the United States.\n\nPost-World War II performing arts were highlighted by the resurgence of both ballet and opera in the Western world.\nPostmodernism in performing arts dominated the 1960s to large extent.\n\nThe earliest recorded theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the passion plays of Ancient Egypt. This story of the god Osiris was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization, marking the known beginning of a long relationship between theatre and religion.\n\nThe most popular forms of theater in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as \"ta'ziya\", where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the \"shaheed\" (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Live secular plays were known as \"akhraja\", recorded in medieval \"adab\" literature, though they were less common than puppetry and \"ta'ziya\" theater.\n\nIn Iran there are other forms of theatrical events such as \"Naghali\" (story telling), \"ٰRu-Howzi\", \"Siah-Bazi\", \"Parde-Khani, \"\"Mareke giri\".\n\nFolk theatre and dramatics can be traced to the religious ritualism of the Vedic peoples in the 2nd millennium BC. This folk theatre of the misty past was mixed with dance, food, ritualism, plus a depiction of events from daily life. The last element made it the origin of the classical theatre of later times. Many historians, notably D. D. Kosambi, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Adya Rangacharaya, etc. have referred to the prevalence of ritualism amongst Indo-Aryan tribes in which some members of the tribe acted as if they were wild animals and some others were the hunters. Those who acted as mammals like goats, buffaloes, reindeer, monkeys, etc. were chased by those playing the role of hunters.\n\nBharata Muni (fl. 5th–2nd century BC) was an ancient Indian writer best known for writing the \"Natya Shastra of Bharata\", a theoretical treatise on Indian performing arts, including theatre, dance, acting, and music, which has been compared to Aristotle's \"Poetics\". Bharata is often known as the father of Indian theatrical arts. His \"Natya Shastra\" seems to be the first attempt to develop the technique or rather art, of drama in a systematic manner. The Natya Shastra tells us not only what is to be portrayed in a drama, but how the portrayal is to be done. Drama, as Bharata Muni says, is the imitation of men and their doings (\"loka-vritti\"). As men and their doings have to be respected on the stage, so drama in Sanskrit is also known by the term \"roopaka\", which means portrayal.\n\nThe \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" can be considered the first recognized plays that originated in India. These epics provided the inspiration to the earliest Indian dramatists and they do it even today. Indian dramatists such as Bhāsa in the 2nd century BC wrote plays that were heavily inspired by the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\".\n\nKālidāsa in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient India's greatest dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the \"Mālavikāgnimitram\" (\"Mālavikā and Agnimitra\"), \"Vikramōrvaśīyam\" (\"Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi\"), and \"Abhijñānaśākuntala\" (\"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"). The last was inspired by a story in the \"Mahabharata\" and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into English and German. In comparison to Bhāsa, who drew heavily from the epics, Kālidāsa can be considered an original playwright.\n\nThe next great Indian dramatist was Bhavabhuti (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: \"Malati-Madhava\", \"Mahaviracharita\" and \"Uttar Ramacharita\". Among these three, the last two cover between them, the entire epic of \"Ramayana\". The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy \"Ratnavali\", \"Priyadarsika\", and the Buddhist drama \"Nagananda\". Many other dramatists followed during the Middle Ages.\n\nThere were many performing art forms in the southern part of India, Kerala is such a state with different such art forms like Koodiyattam, Nangyarkoothu, Kathakali, Chakyar koothu, Thirayattam and there were many prominent artists like Painkulam Raman Chakyar and others.\n\nThere are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the Shang Dynasty; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.\n\nThe Tang dynasty is sometimes known as \"The Age of 1000 Entertainments\". During this era, Emperor Xuanzong formed an acting school known as the Children of the Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather that created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods that controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.\n\nIn the Song dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan Dynasty into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.\n\nIn Thailand, it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic \"Ramakien\", a version of the Indian \"Ramayana\", remains popular in Thailand even today.\n\nIn Cambodia, at the ancient capital Angkor Wat, stories from the Indian epics \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at Borobudur in Indonesia.\n\nDuring the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, Zeami Motokiyo (1363–1443) who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan'ami's company performed for Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), the Shogun of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today Noh. A mixture of pantomime and vocal acrobatics, this style has fascinated the Japanese for hundreds of years.\n\nJapan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1600–1668). However, alarmed at increasing Christian growth, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as Bunraku). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about 1/3d the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his lifetime, most of which are still used today.\n\nKabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of Kabuki's material came from Nõ and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, Kabuki is less formal and more distant than Nõ, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, Kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.\n\nDuring different types of performances, the heart rate varies significantly. For example, studies have been done that show that heart rate varies throughout the different stages of a speech, which include leading up to a speaking role (the highest heart rate occurs during this stage), during the speaking role, and after the speaking role. Similar changes in heart rate also occur during acting, relating to stress. The high heart rates can be attributed to the stress caused by anticipation. During a performance with an audience, the actor experiences high levels of stress throughout the performance, as it pushes the actors mentally. However, this stress helps the actor have a stronger performance. Similar changes in heart rate occur for musicians during their performance. Though their heart rate is highest while they are musically performing, their heart rate is higher during the pre-performance phase, than during the post-performance phase, which is attributed to the stress caused by anticipation. The anticipation leading up to a performance, causes heart rate to increase, while the relief after a performance, causes the heart rate to decrease.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "171435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171435", "title": "Plot device", "text": "Plot device\n\nA plot device, or plot mechanism, is any technique in a narrative used to move the plot forward. A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the suspension of disbelief. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.\n\nMany stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the Indiana Jones film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", he is trying to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant; in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", Jones is on a search for the Holy Grail. This plot device is also used in the \"Arabian Nights\" tale of \"The City of Brass,\" in which a group of travelers on an archaeological expedition journeys across the Sahara to find a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn.\n\nSeveral books in the Harry Potter series orient around a certain object. In \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", Harry believes there is a magical stone in Hogwarts with special powers. Lord Voldemort needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.\n\nThe One Ring from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as Nick Lowe puts it: \"Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa.\"\n\nA MacGuffin is a term, popularized by film director Alfred Hitchcock, referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance. Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, \"In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers.\" This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from The Lord of the Rings), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.\n\nMacGuffins are sometimes referred to as \"plot coupons\" (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to \"collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a dénouement\". The term was coined by Nick Lowe.\n\nThe term \"deus ex machina\" is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.\n\nThe Latin phrase \"deus ex machina\" has its origins in the conventions of Greek tragedy, and refers to situations in which a mechane (crane) was used to lower actors playing a god or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.\n\nThe Greek tragedian Euripides is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play \"Alcestis\", the eponymous heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions. In the end, though, Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a \"deus ex machina\" is Gandalf in \"The Hobbit\". With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was Aristotle in his \"Poetics\", where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.\n\nA shoulder angel is a plot device used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see Negative associations of left-handedness in language). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the id, ego and super-ego in Psychoanalysis, with the person in the center of the dispute being the ego between the super-ego Angel and the id Devil.\n\nThe function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in whodunits, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.\n\nA \"plot voucher\", as defined by Nick Lowe, is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.\n\n"}
{"id": "3829597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3829597", "title": "Real time (media)", "text": "Real time (media)\n\nReal time within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip \"For Better or For Worse\", each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.\n\nReal time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical Greek drama.\n\nOften, use of split screens or picture-in-pictures are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various subplots are affecting each other. Examples include the television series \"24\" and films \"Timecode\" and \"Phone Booth\". On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.\n\n\nIn a real-time computer game or simulation, events in the game occur at the same rate as the events which are being depicted. For instance, in a real-time combat game, in one hour of play the game depicts one hour of combat.\n\nIn comic books, the use of real time is made more complicated by the fact that most serial comics are released on a monthly basis and are traditionally 20 to 30 pages long, making it difficult to tell a story set in real time without overlooking important events from one month to the next. Another explanation is the prevalence of the super-hero genre in American comics, and the iconic status attached to such characters : it is often considered that such mythological, sometimes godlike heroes cannot age in real time without losing the characteristics that make them special. Hence the more common use of floating timelines in Marvel Comics or DC Comics. Exceptions include Marvel Comics' New Universe line of books, Erik Larsen's long-running \"Savage Dragon\" ongoing series, John Byrne's \"\" (three non-canon miniseries exploring the notion of \"what if Superman and Batman could age?\"), and Ben Dunn's \"Ninja High School\".\n\nComic strips which feature characters aging in real-time include:\n\n\nIn the Inspector Rebus series of detective novels (17 as of 2010) by the Scottish writer Ian Rankin, characters age in step with the publication date. Rebus is stated to have been born in 1947; in the 2007 novel \"Exit Music\" he reached 60, and retired.\n\nThe Mandie series of children's mystery novels by Lois Gladys Leppard are exactly one hundred years from the present real time and ended by the eighteenth year (or one hundred and eighteenth year) of the main protagonist in 2006 at the reader's end of childhood and adolescence.\n\nIn \"A Christmas Carol\" the entire story takes place in real time.\n"}
{"id": "9025700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9025700", "title": "Realism (theatre)", "text": "Realism (theatre)\n\nRealism in the theatre was a general movement that began in the 19th-century theatre, around the 1870s, and remained present through much of the 20th century. It developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it includes Naturalism and Socialist realism.\n\nRussia's first professional playwright, Aleksey Pisemsky, along with Leo Tolstoy (in his \"The Power of Darkness\" of 1886), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia. A new type of acting was required to replace the declamatory conventions of the well-made play with a technique capable of conveying the speech and movements found in the domestic situations of everyday life. This need was supplied by the innovations of the Moscow Art Theatre, founded by Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. Whereas the subtle expression of emotion in Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" through everyday small-talk had initially gone unappreciated in a more traditionally conventional production in St Petersburg, a new staging by the Moscow Art Theatre brought the play and its author, as well as the company, immediate success. A logical development was to take the revolt against theatrical artifice a step further in the direction of naturalism, and Stanislavski, especially in his production of Maxim Gorky's \"The Lower Depths\", helped this movement achieve international recognition. The Moscow Art Theatre's ground-breaking productions of plays by Chekhov, such as \"Uncle Vanya\" and \"The Cherry Orchard\", in turn influenced Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of actor training that is particularly well-suited to psychological realism.\n\n19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, \"is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s\" with the \"middle-period\" work of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been \"enormously influential.\"\n\nIn opera, \"verismo\" refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the Naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. \n\n3D details were added by 1800. By 1850 settings, costumes and details became historically accurate and had more logic to the plays.\n\nAs part of a strategic argument in his day, Stanislavski used the term \"psychological realism\" to distinguish his 'system' of acting from his own Naturalistic early stagings of the plays of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and others. Jean Benedetti argues that:\nNaturalism, for him, implied the indiscriminate reproduction of the surface of life. Realism, on the other hand, while taking its material from the real world and from direct observation, selected only those elements which revealed the relationships and tendencies under the surface. The rest was discarded.\nAs used in critical literature today, however, the term Naturalism has a broader scope than that, within which all of Stanislavski's work falls. In this broader sense, Naturalism or \"psychological realism\" is distinct both from Socialist realism and the critical realism developed by the epic theatre of Bertolt Brecht.\n\n\n“Introduction to Theatre -- Realism.” Women's Liberation Movement, https://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/realism.htm\n"}

Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues.\n\nUnlike tribute acts who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as Elvis Presley or The Beatles) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre.\n\nUnlike cover bands who are primarily populist entertainers playing cover versions of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era. Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits.\n\nMost revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre. Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3665145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3665145", "title": "Rule of three (writing)", "text": "Rule of three (writing)\n\nThe rule of three is a writing principle that suggests that a trio of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers in execution of the story and engaging the reader. The reader or audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed. This is because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern. It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy.\n\nSlogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling. Examples include the Three Little Pigs, Three Billy Goats Gruff, and the Three Musketeers. Similarly, adjectives are often grouped in threes to emphasize an idea.\n\nThe Latin phrase \"omne trium perfectum\" (everything that comes in threes is perfect, or, every set of three is complete) conveys the same idea as the rule of three.\n\nThe rule of three can refer to a collection of three words, phrases, sentences, lines, paragraphs/stanzas, chapters/sections of writing and even whole books. The three elements together are known as a triad. The technique may be used not just in prose but poetry, oral storytelling, films and advertising. In photography, the rule of thirds produces a similar effect by dividing an image into three vertically and horizontally.\n\nA tricolon is a more specific use of the rule of three where three words or phrases are equal in length and grammatical form.\n\nA hendiatris is a figure of speech where three successive words are used to express a single central idea. As a slogan or motto, this is known as a tripartite motto.\n\nMany advertising campaigns and public information slogans use the technique to create a catchy, memorable way of displaying information. In marketing theory, American advertising and sales pioneer St. Elmo Lewis laid out his three chief copywriting principles, which he felt were crucial for effective advertising:\n\n\"The mission of an advertisement is to attract a reader so that he will look at the advertisement and start to read it; then to interest him, so that he will continue to read it; then to convince him, so that when he has read it he will believe it. If an advertisement contains these three qualities of success, it is a successful advertisement.\"\n\nBetter-known examples include:\n\nIn comedy, it is also called a \"comic triple\". The third element is often used to create an effect of surprise with an audience, especially if it differs from the first two. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals—such as an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead—where the surprise or punchline of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nIn storytelling, authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely \"beginning, middle, and end\", from Aristotle's Poetics. Syd Field wrote a popular handbook of screenwriting, in which he touted the advantages of three-act structure over the more traditional five-act structure used by William Shakespeare and many other famous playwrights.\n\nVladimir Propp, in his \"Morphology of the Folk Tale\", concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice. This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout folk tales and fairy tales: most commonly, perhaps, in that the youngest son is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:\n\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled \"Our Masters' Voices\", gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \"insult, injustice and exploitation\", followed a few lines later by \"justice, good will, and brotherhood\". Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace inveighed: \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during his 1963 inaugural address.\n\nThe appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of Winston Churchill's reference to \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" (echoing Garibaldi and Theodore Roosevelt) in popular recollection to \"blood, sweat and tears\". Similarly, Thomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan\" describes the importance of community, without which life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad \"nasty, brutish and short\".\n\nThe Welsh Triads and Irish Triads suggest the use of three's was also a mnemonic device—easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.\n\nA common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate. For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase \"I give, devise and bequeath ...\"\n\nUsually (in court) a common example is quoted: \"tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\n"}

The English word for \"piece\" or \"thing\" is sometimes used in a similar context. Another variant is \"bits of business\" or just \"bits\". \"Shtick\" may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as \"Saturday Night Live\". \n\nIn common usage, the word \"shtick\" has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well-known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among Orthodox Jews, \"shtick\" can also refer to wedding shtick, in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.\n\nBecause of its roots in show business, \"shtick\" has taken on connotation of a contrived and often used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians.\n\n"}

When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, \"Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!\".\n\nThe toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a fad toy. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. \"People\" reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its MSRP, had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.\n\n\"Tickles The Chimp\", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior. In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as \"Tickles The Chimp,\" which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make \"Sesame Street\" plush, but did have \"Looney Tunes\" plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me Tasmanian Devil, they also made Tickle Me versions of baby Bugs Bunny and Tweety, they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do \"Looney Tunes\" but gained the rights to \"Sesame Street,\" thus starting Tickle Me Elmo. The invention was originally introduced under Cabbage Patch at Hasbro Industries.\n\nNeil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, \"When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise.\"\n\nTickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units. The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the day after Thanksgiving, when they suddenly sold out. With the Christmas shopping season approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers. Promotion was helped by Rosie O'Donnell, who had shown the toy on her popular TV show in early October. O'Donnell's \"surprise plug\" created unexpected demand for Elmo, resulting in shortages in the stores that sold it.\n\nThe scarcity of the new toy provoked a \"shopping frenzy\". Two women were arrested in Chicago for fighting over the doll, while in New York some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores. Someone allegedly purchased a Tickle Me Elmo for $7,100 in Denver. A clerk working at a Wal-Mart store in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was among those injured by \"Elmo-mania\". During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, a crowd of 300 stampeded down the aisle after spotting him being handed a box of the toys by another employee. Trampled, he suffered \"a pulled hamstring, injuries to his back, jaw and knee, a broken rib and a concussion\".\n\nBy the end of December, the entire stock of one million \"Tickle Me Elmo\" toys had been sold.\n\nIn early 1997, Tyco released new \"Tickle Me\" toys based on other characters from \"Sesame Street\" – first \"Tickle Me Ernie\" and \"Tickle Me Big Bird\", then \"Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo. With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, \"Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" and \"Mini Tickle Me Ernie\" were also put on the market.\n\nThe \"Surprise Edition\" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the \"Surprise Edition\" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.\n\nIn 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, Fisher-Price released a new Elmo doll called \"TMX\", meaning \"Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten\" or \"Tickle Me eXtreme\". The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention (River Forest, Illinois), was first announced at the American International Toy Fair. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.\n\nThe full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing confidentiality agreements. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of \"Toy Wishes\" magazine said, \"The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.\".\nToy analyst Chris Byrne told \"USA Today\", \"This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category.\" Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. \"The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon.\" He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since Furby in 1998. However, some members of the media expected a large response. Toys \"R\" Us stores and Amazon had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill. As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in Tampa, Florida was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on \"Saturday Night Live\", which said the man \"was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason Bert'\".\n\nTMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 financial year to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of financial analysts. TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.\n\nIn January 2007, Mattel announced it would release \"TMX Friends\", featuring Elmo, Ernie and Cookie Monster.\n\nFor the Christmas 2007 season, Fisher-Price released a version with hidden surprises. Mattel has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.\n\nPlayskool released the toy again as \"LOL Elmo\". Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's Sesame Street section, there is a sign printed \"Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012\". Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.\n\nPlayskool made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like \"Elmo is one ticklish monster\". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found\n\n\n"}

The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.\nEven more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices (Santa Fe Opera, 1998) or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011) or on hybrid solutions (Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012), makes the spatial connotation of the term \"sur-titles\" inappropriate.\n\nIn both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term \"titling\", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).\n\n"}
{"id": "1225116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1225116", "title": "Toastmaster", "text": "Toastmaster\n\nToastmaster is a general term, prevalent in the United States in the middle 20th century, referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a public speaking event. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule. Such meetings typically include civic events, service organization meetings, and banquets of various purpose. In many meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a dais or from a podium. At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live television, the toastmaster often takes the form of a master of ceremonies, introducing the entertainment acts. \n\nJames Toole, father of actor John Lawrence Toole was possibly the first professional Toastmaster during the 1840's in London. There are many allusions to him in the press of the day. His obituary noted his \"stentorian voice, and the ability with which he kept very large companies in order\"\n\nWilliam Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with London society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games, and presided over court functions at St. James's Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall,\n\nA widely known person associated with this role was George Jessel, known in his lifetime as \"Toastmaster General of the United States\" (parodying the title Postmaster General of the United States).\n\nIn many service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the fear of public speaking. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light humor, and to have anecdotes and epigrams handily memorized. Toastmasters International is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster.\n\nSuch was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster's glass which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4468597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4468597", "title": "Toy theater", "text": "Toy theater\n\nToy theater, also called paper theater and model theater (also spelt theatre, see spelling differences), is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 19th century in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on paperboard sheets and sold as kits at the concession stand of an opera house, playhouse, or vaudeville theater. Toy theaters were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theater saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards realism on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again with the arrival of television after World War II. Toy theater has seen a resurgence in recent years among many puppeteers, authors and filmmakers and there are numerous international toy theater festivals throughout the Americas and Europe.\n\nThe original toy theaters were mass-produced replicas of popular plays, sold as kits that people assembled at home, including stage, scenery, characters and costumes. They were printed on paperboard, available at English playhouses and commercial libraries for \"a penny plain or two pence coloured.\" Hobbyists often went to great pains to not only hand-color their stages, but to embellish their toy theater personae with bits of cloth and tinsel. Just as the toy-sized stages diminished a play’s scale, their corresponding scripts tended to abridge the text, paring it down to key characters and lines for a shorter, less complicated presentation.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century more than 300 of London’s most popular plays saw issue as toy theaters. Publishers sent artists to the playhouses of Georgian and early-Victorian London to record the scenery, costumes and dramatic attitudes of the greatest successes of the day. The theatre management often provided these artists with a free seat, as the toy theatre sheets were excellent free advertising.\n\nStage theater of the early 19th century had been based more on spectacle than on depth of plot or character, and these characteristics lent themselves effectively to the format of toy theater. Toward the end of the 19th century, European popular drama had shifted its preference to the trend of Realism, marking a dramaturgical swing toward psychological complexity, character motivation and settings utilizing ordinary three-dimensional scenic elements. This trend in stage theater did not make an easy conversion to its toy counterpart, and with the fanciful dramas of 50 years prior being out of fashion, the toy theaters that remained in print fell into obsolescence. \n\nDespite its fall in popularity, toy theater remained in the realm of influential artists who championed its resurgence. In 1884 British author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote an essay in tribute of toy theater’s tiny grandeur entitled “Penny Plain, Twopence Coloured” in which he extolled the virtues of the dramas supplied by Pollock's. Other children’s authors like Lewis Carroll and Hans Christian Andersen also dabbled in toy theater, as did Oscar Wilde. The brothers Jack and William Butler Yeats both used toy theaters as mock-ups for their work in art and stagecraft. In the 20th century toy theater became a tool for the avant-garde, messed with by Futurist founder F.T. Marienetti as well as Pablo Picasso. Film directors like Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles would use toy theaters as staging grounds for their cinematic masterpieces, and Laurence Olivier even made a toy theater of his film version of \"Hamlet\", mass-produced with a little paper cutout of himself in the starring role. But after its second wave boom, toy theater fell into a second recession, replaced in the 1950s, by a different box in people’s sitting rooms that needed no live operator and whose sets, characters, stories and musical numbers were beamed in electronically from miles away to be projected on the glass of a cathode ray tube: television.\n\nToy theater has been enjoying a revival in recent decades. Collectors and traditionalists perform restored versions of Victorian plays while experimental puppeteers push the form’s limits, adapting the works of Isaac Babel and Italo Calvino, as well as that of unsung storytellers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. Contemporary toy theater may utilize any available technology and cover any subject, and numerous international toy theater festivals occur regularly throughout the Americas and Europe, attracting many well-known actors, musicians and authors to their stages.\n\nMass-produced toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the proscenium, scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin cardboard, cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7159081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7159081", "title": "Victorian burlesque", "text": "Victorian burlesque\n\nVictorian burlesque, sometimes known as travesty or extravaganza, is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in Victorian England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of parody in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or pastiching text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of burlesque.\n\nLike ballad opera, burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores. Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as extravaganzas. Many of the male roles were played by actresses as breeches roles, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.\n\nOriginally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included J. R. Planché, H. J. Byron, G. R. Sims, F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert and Fred Leslie.\n\nBurlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the Victorian era. The word \"burlesque\" is derived from the Italian \"burla\", which means \"ridicule or mockery\". According to the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", Victorian burlesque was \"related to and in part derived from pantomime and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'.\" Another antecedent was ballad opera, in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.\nMadame Vestris produced burlesques at the Olympic Theatre beginning in 1831 with \"Olympic Revels\" by J. R. Planché. In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, \"Olympic Revels\" opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing whist. In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in \"The Beggar's Opera\". Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed operetta, music hall and revue, and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as extravaganzas. The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.\n\nUnlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience; some writers, such as the Brough brothers, aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and H. J. Byron's success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes. Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" and \"La traviata\" received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly. \"Our Lady of the Cameleon\" by Leicester Silk Buckingham and \"Our Traviata\" by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of \"Il trovatore\", two of them by H. J. Byron: \"Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer\" (1863) and \"Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto\" (1880). The operas of Bellini, Bizet, Donizetti, Gounod, Handel, Meyerbeer, Mozart, Rossini, Wagner and Weber were burlesqued. In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:\n\nBy the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.\n\nW. S. Gilbert wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with \"Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack\" (1866), the most successful of which was \"Robert the Devil\" (1868). In the 1870s, Lydia Thompson's burlesque troupe, with Willie Edouin, became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as H. B. Farnie and Robert Reece, both in Britain and the U.S.\n\nThe Shakespeare scholar Stanley Wells notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era. Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque \"takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play.\" Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella. The witches greet them with \"Hail! hail! hail!\": Macbeth asks Banquo, \"What mean these salutations, noble thane?\" and is told \"These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'\". Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre. An 1859 burlesque of \"Romeo and Juliet\" contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from \"Don Pasquale\", and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including \"Buffalo Gals\", and \"Nix my Dolly\".\nThe dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad puns. For example, in \"Faust up to Date\" (1888), a couplet reads:\n\nAccording to \"Grove\", although \"an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency.\" Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché (\"fanciful and elegant\") and Gilbert (\"witty, never vulgar\"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, \"the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste.\" Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:\n\nThe question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. Aristophanes, Rabelais, Geo Cruikshank, the authors of the \"Rejected Addresses\", John Leech, Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.\nIn his 1859 Longfellow burlesque \"Hi-A-Wa-Tha\", the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by Mrs. John Wood as Minnehaha:\n\nIn a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to \"The Pretty Druidess\":\n\nActresses in burlesque would often play breeches roles, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles. These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.\n\nThe depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture. Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned. Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”\n\nBurlesque became the specialty of London's Royal Strand Theatre and Gaiety Theatre from the 1860s to the early 1890s. In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognize. Nellie Farren starred as the Gaiety Theatre's \"principal boy\" from 1868, and John D'Auban choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891. Edward O'Connor Terry joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included \"Robert the Devil\" (1868, by Gilbert), \"The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole\" (1877), \"Blue Beard\" (1882), \"Ariel\" (1883, by F. C. Burnand) and \"Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed\" (1883).\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer Fred Leslie joined the Gaiety, composers like Meyer Lutz and Osmond Carr contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format. These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie. They often included Leslie's libretti, written under his pseudonym, \"A. C. Torr\", and were usually given an original score by Lutz: \"Little Jack Sheppard\" (1885), \"Monte Cristo Jr.\" (1886), \"Pretty Esmeralda\" (1887), \"Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim\" (1887), \"Mazeppa\" and \"Faust up to Date\" (1888). \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\" (1889) made fun of the play \"Ruy Blas\" by Victor Hugo. The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused. The last Gaiety burlesques were \"Carmen up to Data\" (1890), \"Cinder Ellen up too Late\" (1891), and \"Don Juan\" (1892, with lyrics by Adrian Ross).\n\nIn the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of Edwardian musical comedy. In 1896, Seymour Hicks declared that burlesque \"is dead as a doornail and will never be revived.\" From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "494010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494010", "title": "Wing Bowl", "text": "Wing Bowl\n\nWing Bowl was an annual eating contest founded in 1993 by Philadelphia talk-radio hosts Angelo Cataldi and Al Morganti. The contest was first broadcast on WIP. \n\nAbout 150 people attended Wing Bowl I (held in a hotel) in 1993 to see a competition between two contestants. The event pits competitive eaters in a Buffalo wing eating contest. The Wing Bowl is traditionally held on the Friday before the Super Bowl. The event, which began as a radio promotion, has grown to encompass television, the Internet, and a contest for women who are termed \"the Wingettes.\"\n\nSince 2000, the event was held at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, where it is still broadcast live on 94-WIP-FM. There are currently no television deals to broadcast the event live; however, a replay is usually shown on CW 57, Comcast SportsNet, or one of the other local stations within the following week. The Wing Bowl drew crowds of over 20,000. \n\nThe final Wing Bowl, Wing Bowl XXVI was held on February 2, 2018 and the winner was Molly Schuyler, who devoured a record 501 wings in a half hour.\n\nWing Bowl was the brainchild of WIP radio host Al Morganti, who came up with the idea when it became apparent the Philadelphia Eagles were not going to make the Super Bowl anytime soon. It is also suggested that Morganti was fed up with the Buffalo Bills going to the Super Bowl and not winning. The first Wing Bowl was held in the lobby of the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel in Center City. Carmen Cordero walked away with the inaugural title, receiving a hibachi as his prize.\n\nSince then, media coverage has grown to the point where every one of the major Philadelphia television stations has covered the event. The ABC 6, CBS Channel 3 and Fox 29 affiliates all aired live reports from the event during their morning news. Features on the event have appeared in the \"Courier-Post\", \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" and \"Daily News\" as well as a host of newspapers in the surrounding counties. The event has been featured on ESPN and the syndicated television shows \"Real TV\" and \"The Montel Williams Show\". Segments on Wing Bowl have appeared on TV newscasts in cities throughout the country. Several Wing Bowl contestants, including \"El Wingador,\" competed in Fox's \"Glutton Bowl\" in the spring of 2002. The 2007 Wing Bowl was carried on Comcast Cable's On Demand channel.\n\nThen Mayor of Philadelphia and future Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell attended Wing Bowls II, III, IV and VI, where he presented the winner with a \"Liberty Bell\" trophy. Other celebrities who have appeared include retired heavyweight boxer Randall \"Tex\" Cobb, former 76ers President Pat Croce, former Phillies manager Larry Bowa, U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, and others. Major-league umpire Eric Gregg served as the \"Commissioner\" of Wing Bowl from its second year until his death from a stroke on 5 June 2006. From December 2006 to 2013, Pat Croce was the second commissioner. Jon Dorenbos has been the third commissioner since 2014.\n\nEntry into Wing Bowl can be gained in two ways, the first of which is successfully performing an \"eating stunt\" on air during \"The Morning Show\" at the 94 WIP studios in Center City, Philadelphia, with Al Morganti as judge. Stunts have included eating 20 cups of cooked oatmeal, eating of creamed spinach with of hot sauce, and eating five Big Macs. The stunt must be completed within a time limit negotiated between the contestant and Morganti. Morganti, known to be a tough judge, has disallowed stunts that involved what he considers \"cheating\", such as dipping bread into a beverage to make it easier to swallow, or breaking up a food item into constituent parts for easier chewing (such as separating hot dogs from their buns). He is also tough on contestants who suggest a stunt involving liquid consumption; \"The Morning Show\" hosts prefer eating stunts over drinking stunts. If a person offers to perform a drinking stunt, it must be compelling to the hosts, such as Wing Bowl XIV champion Joey Chestnut's offer to drink of milk. The hosts deemed it not difficult enough, but, fortunately for Chestnut, former champion Bill \"El Wingador\" Simmons was present and declared the stunt to have a high level of difficulty, upon which the hosts accepted his offer, with a five-minute time limit to complete the challenge.\n\nThe other way to gain entry to Wing Bowl is to win a \"Wingoff.\" A \"Wingoff\" is a 10-minute eating contest held at a Philadelphia or South Jersey bar hosted by former Philadelphia Eagle and WIP Host Hugh Douglas and WIP Personality Marc Farzetta. The \"Wingoffs\" began in 2005 when 610 WIP decided to spoof the Big 5 Philadelphia area universities basketball teams. The winner of these \"Wingoffs\" gain automatic entry into the Wing Bowl.\n\nWIP announced on October 30, 2018 that event was being canceled after 26 years because the time for doing so felt right after the Eagles won Super Bowl LII. According to WIP program director Spike Eskin, \"When Wing Bowl started ... a large part of it was the lead-up to the Super Bowl never involved the Eagles. We just wanted to get to the promised land.\"\n\nWing Bowl 15 is known as \"Philadelphia Against The World\". Tickets sold out on the first day of sales. Wing Bowl 15 was presented by Philadelphia Park Casino. Pat Croce was this year's Wing Bowl Commissioner. Pat took the helm after the tragic loss of WIP's dear friend Eric Gregg.\n\nGoing into Wing Bowl 16 WIP Host, Angelo Cataldi, billed it as the greatest Wing Bowl ever. With El Wingador coming out of retirement to square off against the number one eater in the world, Joey Chestnut. Wing Bowl 16 also featured a change in chicken wing providers, which contributed to the shattering of the elusive 200 wing mark.\n\nUnlike the past years in which professional eaters were allowed to participate, Wing Bowl 17 on January 30, 2009 at the Wachovia Center, was an all Amateur eater event, promoting eaters from the local neighborhoods in and around the Philadelphia area. There are 25 eaters in Wing Bowl 17, with Wing Bowl 8 Champion \"Tollman Joe\" participating. This marks the first occasion that Wing Bowl creator Al Morganti gave a special dispensation that Tollman Joe did not have to perform an eating stunt to be in the Wing Bowl field, since he has been the only amateur to beat Bill \"El Wingador\" Simmons.\n\nJonathan \"Super\" Squibb of Winslow Twp., NJ, took the Wing Bowl 17 title of Wing Bowl Champion by eating 203 wings.\n\nWing Bowl 18 took place on February 5, 2010. Jonathan Squibb finished with a total of 238 wings to win his second Wing Bowl in a row. Squibb finished 93 wings ahead of the second place finisher and won a Ford F-150 truck and a championship ring as prizes.\n\nJonathan Squibb won for the third consecutive year by 255 eating wings to win Wing Bowl 19. Squibb's total broke the record of 241 wings set by Joey Chestnut at Wing Bowl 16 (2008) and was one wing more than second place finisher Bill Simmons was able to eat. Squibb won $20,000 in cash and 2011 Dodge Ram truck.\n\nTakeru Kobayashi set a new competition record by eating 337 wings to win Wing Bowl 20.
