This is related to Cesare Burali-Forti's \"paradox\" which states that there can be no greatest ordinal number. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.\n\nMore generally, as noted by A. W. Moore, there can be no end to the process of set formation, and thus no such thing as the \"totality of all sets\", or the \"set hierarchy\". Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the hierarchy and thus failing to contain every set.\n\nA standard solution to this problem is found in Zermelo's set theory, which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property \"and lie in some given set\" (Zermelo's Axiom of Separation). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.\n\nWhile this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, naive set theory might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a class to describe arbitrary (possibly \"large\") entities, these predicates of the meta-language may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a proper class. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in set theory and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as New Foundations by Willard Van Orman Quine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43405", "title": "Actuary", "text": "Actuary\n\nAn actuary is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of risk and uncertainty . The name of the corresponding field is actuarial science. These risks can affect both sides of the balance sheet and require asset management, liability management, and valuation skills . Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms .\n\nWhile the concept of insurance dates to antiquity (, , ), the concepts needed to scientifically measure and mitigate risks have their origins in the 17th century studies of probability and annuities . Actuaries of the 21st century require analytical skills, business knowledge, and an understanding of human behavior and information systems to design and manage programs that control risk . The actual steps needed to become an actuary are usually country-specific; however, almost all processes share a rigorous schooling or examination structure and take many years to complete (, ).\n\nThe profession has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable . In various studies, being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010 (, , ).\n\nActuaries use skills primarily in mathematics, particularly calculus-based probability and mathematical statistics, but also economics, computer science, finance, and business. For this reason, actuaries are essential to the insurance and reinsurance industries, either as staff employees or as consultants; to other businesses, including sponsors of pension plans; and to government agencies such as the Government Actuary's Department in the United Kingdom or the Social Security Administration in the United States of America. Actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner that will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis (, ).\n\nMost traditional actuarial disciplines fall into two main categories: life and non-life.\n\nLife actuaries, which include health and pension actuaries, primarily deal with mortality risk, morbidity risk, and investment risk. Products prominent in their work include life insurance, annuities, pensions, short and long term disability insurance, health insurance, health savings accounts, and long-term care insurance . In addition to these risks, social insurance programs are influenced by public opinion, politics, budget constraints, changing demographics, and other factors such as medical technology, inflation, and cost of living considerations (, ).\n\nNon-life actuaries, also known as property and casualty or general insurance actuaries, deal with both physical and legal risks that affect people or their property. Products prominent in their work include auto insurance, homeowners insurance, commercial property insurance, workers' compensation, malpractice insurance, product liability insurance, marine insurance, terrorism insurance, and other types of liability insurance .\n\nActuaries are also called upon for their expertise in enterprise risk management . This can involve dynamic financial analysis, stress testing, the formulation of corporate risk policy, and the setting up and running of corporate risk departments . Actuaries are also involved in other areas of the financial services industry, such as analysing securities offerings or market research .\n\nOn both the life and casualty sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and reserves for insurance policies covering various risks . On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying the probability of a loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. The amount of time that occurs before the loss event is important, as the insurer will not have to pay anything until after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither of these kinds of analysis are purely deterministic processes, stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity distributions and the parameters of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side .\n\nActuaries do not always attempt to predict aggregate future events. Often, their work may relate to determining the cost of financial liabilities that have already occurred, called retrospective reinsurance, or the development or re-pricing of new products.\n\nActuaries also design and maintain products and systems. They are involved in financial reporting of companies' assets and liabilities. They must communicate complex concepts to clients who may not share their language or depth of knowledge. Actuaries work under a code of ethics that covers their communications and work products .\n\nAs an outgrowth of their more traditional roles, actuaries also work in the fields of risk management and enterprise risk management for both financial and non-financial corporations . Actuaries in traditional roles study and use the tools and data previously in the domain of finance . The Basel II accord for financial institutions (2004), and its analogue, the Solvency II accord for insurance companies (to come into effect in 2016), require institutions to account for operational risk separately, and in addition to, credit, reserve, asset, and insolvency risk. Actuarial skills are well suited to this environment because of their training in analyzing various forms of risk, and judging the potential for upside gain, as well as downside loss associated with these forms of risk .\n\nActuaries are also involved in investment advice and asset management, and can be general business managers and chief financial officers (, ). They analyze business prospects with their financial skills in valuing or discounting risky future cash flows, and apply their pricing expertise from insurance to other lines of business. For example, insurance securitization requires both actuarial and finance skills . Actuaries also act as expert witnesses by applying their analysis in court trials to estimate the economic value of losses such as lost profits or lost wages .\n\nThe basic requirements of communal interests gave rise to risk sharing since the dawn of civilization. For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After barter came into existence, more complex risks emerged and new forms of risk manifested. Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives. Intermediaries developed to warehouse and trade goods, which exposed them to financial risk. The primary providers in extended families or households ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, which could leave their dependents to starve. Credit procurement was difficult if the creditor worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society .\n\nIn the ancient world there was not always room for the sick, suffering, disabled, aged, or the poor—these were often not part of the cultural consciousness of societies . Early methods of protection, aside from the normal support of the extended family, involved charity; religious organizations or neighbors would collect for the destitute and needy. By the middle of the 3rd century, 1,500 suffering people were being supported by charitable operations in Rome . Charitable protection remains an active form of support in the modern era , but receiving charity is uncertain and is often accompanied by social stigma. Elementary mutual aid agreements and pensions did arise in antiquity . Early in the Roman empire, associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to burial insurance and friendly societies. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of columbāria, or burial vaults, owned by the fund . Other early examples of mutual surety and assurance pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society .\n\nNon-life insurance started as a hedge against loss of cargo during sea travel. Anecdotal reports of such guarantees occur in the writings of Demosthenes, who lived in the 4th century BCE . The earliest records of an official non-life insurance policy come from Sicily, where there is record of a 14th-century contract to insure a shipment of wheat . In 1350, Lenardo Cattaneo assumed \"all risks from act of God, or of man, and from perils of the sea\" that may occur to a shipment of wheat from Sicily to Tunis up to a maximum of 300 florins. For this he was paid a premium of 18% .\n\nDuring the 17th century, a more scientific basis for risk management was being developed. In 1662, a London draper named John Graunt showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a defined group, or cohort, of people, despite the uncertainty about the future longevity or mortality of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original life table. Combining this idea with that of compound interest and annuity valuation, it became possible to set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy each member's necessary contributions to a common fund, assuming a fixed rate of interest. The first person to correctly calculate these values was Edmond Halley . In his work, Halley demonstrated a method of using his life table to calculate the premium someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life-annuity .\n\nJames Dodson's pioneering work on the level premium system led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as Equitable Life) in London in 1762. This was the first life insurance company to use premium rates that were calculated scientifically for long-term life policies, using Dodson's work. After Dodson's death in 1757, Edward Rowe Mores took over the leadership of the group that eventually became the Society for Equitable Assurances. It was he who specified that the chief official should be called an \"actuary\" . Previously, the use of the term had been restricted to an official who recorded the decisions, or \"acts\", of ecclesiastical courts, in ancient times originally the secretary of the Roman senate, responsible for compiling the \"Acta Senatus\" . Other companies that did not originally use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable .\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, computational complexity was limited to manual calculations. The actual calculations required to compute fair insurance premiums are complex. The actuaries of that time developed methods to construct easily used tables, using sophisticated approximations called commutation functions, to facilitate timely, accurate, manual calculations of premiums . Over time, actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by ensuring competency and ethical standards . Since calculations were cumbersome, actuarial shortcuts were commonplace.\n\nNon-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life compatriots in the early 20th century. In the United States, the 1920 revision to workers' compensation rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries . In the 1930s and 1940s, rigorous mathematical foundations for stochastic processes were developed . Actuaries began to forecast losses using models of random events instead of deterministic methods. Computers further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to microcomputers, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has grown exponentially .\n\nAnother modern development is the convergence of modern financial theory with actuarial science . In the early 20th century, actuaries were developing techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition . In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models . In the 21st century, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, combines tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory , but is still not completely aligned with modern financial economics .\n\nAs there are relatively few actuaries in the world compared to other professions, actuaries are in high demand, and are highly paid for the services they render (, ). , in the United States, newly credentialed actuaries on average earn around $100,000 per year, while more experienced actuaries can earn over $150,000 per year . Similarly, survey in the United Kingdom indicated a starting salary for a newly credentialed actuary of about £50,000; actuaries with more experience can earn well in excess of £100,000 .\n\nThe actuarial profession has been consistently ranked for decades as one of the most desirable. Actuaries work comparatively reasonable hours, in comfortable conditions, without the need for physical exertion that may lead to injury, are well paid, and the profession consistently has a good hiring outlook . Not only has the overall profession ranked highly, but it also is considered one of the best professions for women , and one of the best recession-proof professions . In the United States, the profession was rated as the best profession by CareerCast, which uses five key criteria to rank jobs—environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress, in 2010 , 2013 , and 2015 . In other years, it remained in the top 10 (, , ). In the United Kingdom , and around the world , actuaries continue to be highly ranked as a profession.\n\nBecoming a fully credentialed actuary requires passing a rigorous series of professional examinations, usually taking several years. In some countries, such as Denmark, most study takes place in a university setting . In others, such as the US, most study takes place during employment through a series of examinations (, ). In the UK, and countries based on its process, there is a hybrid university-exam structure .\n\nAs these qualifying exams are extremely rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars designed for the exams . Also, many companies that employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours. A common rule of thumb for exam students is that, for the Society of Actuaries examinations, roughly 400 hours of study time are necessary for each four-hour exam . Thus, thousands of hours of study time should be anticipated over several years, assuming no failures .\n\nHistorically, the actuarial profession has been reluctant to specify the pass marks for its examinations (, ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, \"Although students find it hard to believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting.\" . In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers . The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that \"the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActuaries have appeared in works of fiction including literature, theater, television, and film. At times, they have been portrayed as \"math-obsessed, socially disconnected individuals with shockingly bad comb-overs\", which has resulted in a mixed response amongst actuaries themselves .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30609033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30609033", "title": "Adequality", "text": "Adequality\n\nAdequality is a technique developed by Pierre de Fermat in his treatise \"Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam\" (a Latin treatise circulated in France c. 1636) to calculate maxima and minima of functions, tangents to curves, area, center of mass, least action, and other problems in calculus. According to André Weil, Fermat \"introduces the technical term adaequalitas, adaequare, etc., which he says he has borrowed from Diophantus. As Diophantus V.11 shows, it means an approximate equality, and this is indeed how Fermat explains the word in one of his later writings.\" (Weil 1973). Diophantus coined the word παρισότης (\"parisotēs\") to refer to an approximate equality. Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac translated Diophantus's Greek word into Latin as \"adaequalitas\". Paul Tannery's French translation of Fermat’s Latin treatises on maxima and minima used the words \"adéquation\" and \"adégaler\".\n\nFermat used \"adequality\" first to find maxima of functions, and then adapted it to find tangent lines to curves.\n\nTo find the maximum of a term formula_1, Fermat equated (or more precisely adequated) formula_1 and formula_3 and after doing algebra he could cancel out a factor of formula_4 and then discard any remaining terms involving formula_5 To illustrate the method by Fermat's own example, consider the problem of finding the maximum of formula_6 (In Fermat's words, it is to divide a line formula_7 at a point formula_8, such that the product of the two parts formula_9 be a maximum.) Fermat \"adequated\" formula_10 with formula_11. That is (using the notation formula_12 to denote adequality, introduced by Paul Tannery):\nCanceling terms and dividing by formula_14 Fermat arrived at\nRemoving the terms that contained formula_14 Fermat arrived at the desired result that the maximum occurred when formula_17.\n\nFermat also used his principle to give a mathematical derivation of Snell's laws of refraction directly from the principle that light takes the quickest path.\n\nFermat's method was highly criticized by his contemporaries, particularly Descartes. V. Katz suggests this is because Descartes had independently discovered the same new mathematics, known as his method of normals, and Descartes was quite proud of his discovery. Katz also notes that while Fermat's methods were closer to the future developments in calculus, Descartes' methods had a more immediate impact on the development.\n\nBoth Newton and Leibniz referred to Fermat's work as an antecedent of infinitesimal calculus. Nevertheless, there is disagreement amongst modern scholars about the exact meaning of Fermat's adequality. Fermat's \"adequality\" was analyzed in a number of scholarly studies. In 1896, Paul Tannery published a French translation of Fermat’s Latin treatises on maxima and minima (Fermat, Œuvres, Vol. III, pp. 121–156). Tannery translated Fermat's term as “adégaler” and adopted Fermat’s “adéquation”. Tannery also introduced the symbol formula_12 for adequality in mathematical formulas.\n\nHeinrich Wieleitner (1929) wrote:Fermat replaces \"A\" with \"A\"+\"E\". Then he sets the new expression roughly equal (angenähert gleich) to the old one, cancels equal terms on both sides, and divides by the highest possible power of \"E\". He then cancels all terms which contain \"E\" and sets those that remain equal to each other. From that [the required] \"A\" results. That \"E\" should be as small as possible is nowhere said and is at best expressed by the word \"adaequalitas\". (Wieleitner uses the symbol formula_19.)\n<br>\n\nMax Miller (1934) wrote:Thereupon one should put the both terms, which express the maximum and the minimum, approximately equal (näherungsweise gleich), as Diophantus says.(Miller uses the symbol formula_20.)\n<br>\n\nJean Itard (1948) wrote:One knows that the expression \"adégaler\" is adopted by Fermat from Diophantus, translated by Xylander and by Bachet. It is about an approximate equality (égalité approximative) \". (Itard uses the symbol formula_21.)\n<br>\n\nJoseph Ehrenfried Hofmann (1963) wrote:Fermat chooses a quantity \"h\", thought as sufficiently small, and puts \"f\"(\"x\" + \"h\") roughly equal (ungefähr gleich) to \"f\"(\"x\"). His technical term is \"adaequare\".(Hofmann uses the symbol formula_20.)\n<br>\n\nPeer Strømholm (1968) wrote:The basis of Fermat's approach was the comparition of two expressions which, though they had the same form, were not exactly equal. This part of the process he called \"\"comparare par adaequalitatem\" or \"comparer per adaequalitatem\"\", and it implied that the otherwise strict identity between the two sides of the \"equation\" was destroyed by the modification of the variable by a \"small\" amount:\n\nformula_23.\n\nThis, I believe, was the real significance of his use of Diophantos' πἀρισον, stressing the \"smallness\" of the variation. The ordinary translation of 'adaequalitas' seems to be \"approximate equality\", but I much prefer \"pseudo-equality\" to present Fermat's thought at this point.He further notes that \"there was never in M1 (Method 1) any question of the variation \"E\" being put equal to zero. The words Fermat used to express the process of suppressing terms containing \"E\" was 'elido', 'deleo', and 'expungo', and in French 'i'efface' and 'i'ôte'. We can hardly believe that a sane man wishing to express his meaning and searching for words, would constantly hit upon such tortuous ways of imparting the simple fact that the terms vanished because \"E\" was zero.(p. 51)\n<br>\n\nClaus Jensen (1969) wrote:Moreover, in applying the notion of \"adégalité\" – which constitutes the basis of Fermat's general method of constructing tangents, and by which is meant a comparition of two magnitudes as if they were equal, although they are in fact not (\"tamquam essent aequalia, licet revera aequalia non sint\") – I will employ the nowadays more usual symbol formula_20. The Latin quotation comes from Tannery's 1891 edition of Fermat, volume 1, page 140.\n<br>\n\nMichael Sean Mahoney (1971) wrote:Fermat's Method of maxima and minima, which is clearly applicable to any polynomial 'P(x)\", originally rested on purely \"finitistic\" algebraic foundations. It assumed, counterfactually, the inequality of two equal roots in order to determine, by Viete's theory of equations, a relation between those roots and one of the coefficients of the polynomial, a relation that was fully general. This relation then led to an extreme-value solution when Fermat removed his counterfactual assumption and set the roots equal. Borrowing a term from Diophantus, Fermat called this counterfactual equality 'adequality'.(Mahoney uses the symbol formula_25.) On p. 164, end of footnote 46, Mahoney notes that one of the meanings of adequality is \"approximate equality\" or \"equality in the limiting case\".\n<br>\n\nCharles Henry Edwards, Jr. (1979) wrote:For example, in order to determine how to subdivide a segment of length formula_26 into two segments formula_27 and formula_28 whose product formula_29 is maximal, that is to find the rectangle with perimeter formula_30 that has the maximal area, he [Fermat] proceeds as follows. First he substituted formula_31 (he used \"A\", \"E\" instead of \"x\", \"e\") for the unknown \"x\", and then wrote down the following \"pseudo-equality\" to compare the resulting expression with the original one:\n\nAfter canceling terms, he divided through by \"e\" to obtain formula_33 Finally he discarded the remaining term containing \"e\", transforming the pseudo-equality into the true equality formula_34 that gives the value of \"x\" which makes formula_35 maximal. Unfortunately, Fermat never explained the logical basis for this method with sufficient clarity or completeness to prevent disagreements between historical scholars as to precisely what he meant or intended.\"\n\nKirsti Andersen (1980) wrote:The two expressions of the maximum or minimum are made \"adequal\", which means something like as nearly equal as possible.(Andersen uses the symbol formula_25.)\n<br>\n\nHerbert Breger (1994) wrote:I want to put forward my hypothesis: \"Fermat used the word \"adaequare\" in the sense of\" \"to put equal\" ... In a mathematical context, the only difference between \"aequare\" and \"adaequare\" seems to be that the latter gives more stress on the fact that the equality is achieved.(Page 197f.)\n<br>\n\nJohn Stillwell (Stillwell 2006 p. 91) wrote:Fermat introduced the idea of adequality in 1630s but he was ahead of his time. His successors were unwilling to give up the convenience of ordinary equations, preferring to use equality loosely rather than to use adequality accurately. The idea of adequality was revived only in the twentieth century, in the so-called non-standard analysis.\n<br>\n\nEnrico Giusti (2009) cites Fermat's letter to Marin Mersenne where Fermat wrote:Cette comparaison par adégalité produit deux termes inégaux qui enfin produisent l'égalité (selon ma méthode) qui nous donne la solution de la question\" (\"This comparison by adequality produces two unequal terms which finally produce the equality (following my method) which gives us the solution of the problem\").. Giusti notes in a footnote that this letter seems to have escaped Breger's notice.\n<br>\n\nKlaus Barner (2011) asserts that Fermat uses two different Latin words (aequabitur and adaequabitur) to replace the nowadays usual equals sign, \"aequabitur\" when the equation concerns a valid identity between two constants, a universally valid (proved) formula, or a conditional equation, \"adaequabitur\", however, when the equation describes a relation between two variables, which are \"not independent\" (and the equation is no valid formula). On page 36, Barner writes: \"Why did Fermat continually repeat his inconsistent procedure for all his examples for the method of tangents? Why did he never mention the secant, with which he in fact operated? I do not know.\"\n\nKatz, Schaps, Shnider (2013) argue that Fermat's application of the technique to transcendental curves such as the cycloid shows that Fermat's technique of adequality goes beyond a purely algebraic algorithm, and that, contrary to Breger's interpretation, the technical terms \"parisotes\" as used by Diophantus and \"adaequalitas\" as used by Fermat both mean \"approximate equality\". They develop a formalisation of Fermat's technique of adequality in modern mathematics as the standard part function which rounds off a finite hyperreal number to its nearest real number.\n\n\n"}

In 2006, the Royal Institution of Great Britain named it one of the best science-related works ever written.\n\n\"Arcadia\" is set in Sidley Park, an English country house in Derbyshire, and takes place in both 1809/1812 and the present day (1993 in the original production). The activities of two modern scholars and the house's current residents are juxtaposed with those of the people who lived there in the earlier period.\n\nIn 1809, Thomasina Coverly, the daughter of the house, is a precocious teenager with ideas about mathematics, nature and physics well ahead of her time. She studies with her tutor Septimus Hodge, a friend of Lord Byron (an unseen guest in the house).

Septimus Hodge is trying to distract 13-year-old Thomasina from her curiosity about \"carnal embrace\" by challenging her to prove Fermat's Last Theorem; he also wants to focus on reading the poem \"The Couch of Eros\" by Ezra Chater, a guest at the house. Thomasina starts asking why jam mixed in rice pudding can never be unstirred, which leads her on to the topic of determinism and to a beginning theory about chaotic shapes in nature. This is interrupted by Chater himself, who is angry that his wife was caught in the aforementioned \"carnal embrace\" with Septimus; he has come to demand a duel. Septimus tries to defuse the situation by heaping praise on \"The Couch of Eros\". The tactic works, because Chater does not know it was Septimus who savaged an earlier work of his, \"The Maid of Turkey\". Then landscape architect Richard Noakes enters, shortly accompanied by Captain Brice and Lady Croom; the three discuss proposed modifications to the gardens, while Thomasina sketches an imaginary hermit on Noakes's technical drawing of the garden.\n\nThe setting shifts to the present day. Hannah Jarvis is researching the house, the garden, and specifically the hermit, for a study of hermits and the Romantic imagination. Bernard Nightingale enters with Chloe Coverly; she conceals his identity from Hannah, as he had given Hannah's last book a poor review. Chloe's brother, Valentine, is gathering data on the population biology of the grouse in the surrounding grounds, using the house's \"game books\". When Chloe accidentally reveals Bernard's identity, Hannah reacts angrily; but she agrees to share her research material, which enables him to propose the theory that one of the 1809 inhabitants, Ezra Chater, was killed in a duel by Lord Byron. Bernard notes that records of Chater the poet disappeared after 1809, and the only other Chater of record is a botanist.\n\nThe third scene returns to the earlier time frame; Septimus is again tutoring Thomasina, this time in translating Latin. Again their focus diverts, this time to the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, which upsets Thomasina. She mourns the loss of the knowledge stored there, and Septimus responds that all that was lost will eventually turn up again. They are again interrupted by Chater, who succeeds in challenging Septimus to the duel, having learned (from Lord Byron off-stage) that Septimus wrote the damning review.\n\nHannah rediscovers Thomasina's primer containing her ideas on iteration and chaos theory; this recalls Septimus' assertion that what was lost is eventually rediscovered. Valentine reacts with interest to the notes, as his own research centres on similar concepts.\n\nStill in the present, Bernard gives Hannah, Valentine, and Chloe a preview of his lecture theorising that Lord Byron shot and killed Chater in a duel. When Hannah and Valentine challenge his logic, Bernard launches into a diatribe about the irrelevance of science, then departs for his lecture (and a promotional media appearance) in London. Hannah begins to suspect that the hermit of Sidley Park – who was reportedly obsessed with algebraic computations about the heat death of the universe, the theory suggested in Thomasina's diagram – could have been Septimus.\n\nReturning to 1809, we learn that the duel never occurred. Instead, the Chaters left for the West Indies with Captain Brice, Mr. Chater serving as the expedition's botanist and Mrs. Chater as the captain's secret paramour. Lord Byron has also left the country. Septimus has gone rabbit hunting for Thomasina, who favours rabbit pie; he returns to find Lady Croom searching for him. She has found two letters Septimus wrote in case he should die in the duel: one to Thomasina, is about rice pudding, and the other is a love letter addressed to herself. Lady Croom invites Septimus to an amorous rendezvous.\n\nThe final scene takes place in both 1812 and the present, the actions running concurrently. Some present-day characters are in fancy dress for a party, so that both casts appear similarly attired. Chloe reads a newspaper report on the Byron murder theory and then talks about determinism with Valentine, echoing the discussion between Septimus and Thomasina. Chloe, however, believes that sex is the force disrupting the universe's ordered plan. Valentine, using his computer to extrapolate Thomasina's ideas, relates them to the concept of entropy; he wonders whether Thomasina or Septimus was the genius behind the theories. Hannah and Valentine mention that Thomasina died in a fire on the eve of her seventeenth birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomasina asks Septimus to teach her to dance, for her forthcoming birthday party. Lady Croom enters, complaining to Noakes about the noise of his steam engine; Thomasina notes that the machine obeys the laws of entropy (which have not yet been formalized), which describe the universe as winding down. In the present, Bernard arrives and is met by Hannah, who has found a letter detailing the facts of Chater's death – this discovery totally discredits his theory and vindicates Lord Byron's reputation. While Septimus awaits appropriate music for Thomasina's dance lesson, he examines the sketch she made to illustrate the irreversibility of heat; his action mirrors that of Hannah and Valentine, who also pondered the same diagram. Bernard is caught in a compromising position with Chloe, and is asked to depart.\n\nEventually a waltz starts, and Septimus dances with Thomasina, their relationship increasingly complicated by hints of romance. Gus (Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been silent for the entire play) hands another of Thomasina's drawings to a surprised Hannah. It depicts Septimus and the tortoise, confirming her suspicion that the hermit, who had a tortoise called Plautus, was actually Septimus. After Thomasina's tragic death, he apparently became a hermit; accepting her challenge to the laws of the universe as propounded by Newton, he worked for the rest of his life to apply \"honest English algebra\" to the question of the universe's future.\n\n\n\n\"Arcadia\" is, on the surface, somewhere between a tragedy and a comedy. It involves some elements of classical tragedy — \"noble\" characters and the audience's foreknowledge of Thomasina's death — but the predominant element is comedy, in the way that the characters interact with each other and in their witty, epigrammatic dialogue.\n\n\"Arcadia\" explores the nature of evidence and truth in the context of modern ideas about history, mathematics and physics. It shows how clues left by the past are interpreted in the present, by both laypeople and scholars. Stoppard has said that his initial inspiration came from reading James Gleick's 1987 bestseller, \"\", \"which is about this new kind of mathematics. That sounds fairly daunting if one's talking about a play. I thought, here is a marvellous metaphor.\" Besides chaos, the play attends to a wide array of subjects, including thermodynamics, computer algorithms, fractals, population dynamics, determinism (especially in the context of love and death), classics, landscape design, Romanticism vs. Classicism, English literature (particularly poetry), Byron, 18th century periodicals, modern academia, and even South Pacific botany. These are all concrete topics of conversation; their more abstract resonances rise into epistemology, nihilism, and the origins of lust and madness.\n\n\"Arcadia\"'s themes are presented in a series of dichotomies. Most prominent is chaos versus order. The play's characters and action embody this, moving from a settled social order, in which relationships arise, toward the final scene, where the social order – and even the separation of the two eras – dissolve in the party's chaos, relationships collapse, and the characters die or disperse. Yet within that chaos, order can still be found. As Valentine declares: \"In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing.\" Although the play's world grows increasingly chaotic – with overlapping time periods, increasingly complex ideas, and ever greater variations in social norms and assumptions — connections and order can still be discerned. The characters attempt to find and articulate the order they perceive in their world, even as it is continually overturned.\n\nThe center-stage table that collects props from both time periods throughout the play is a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at Bath Spa University, explains: \"At the end of the play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden 'order' of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that tomorrow night's performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical 'disorder' — which therefore cannot really be disorder at all.\"\n\nA closely related theme in \"Arcadia\" is the opposition of Classicism and Romanticism. This appears most clearly in the running argument between Noakes and Lady Croom about proposed changes to the garden. They all involve moving from the tidy order of Classic style to the rugged naturalism and Gothic mystery of the Romantic. A parallel dichotomy is expressed by Septimus and Thomasina: He instructs her in the Newtonian vision of the universe, while she keeps posing questions and proposing theories that undercut it. Hannah's search for the hermit of Sidley Park also touches on this theme. \"The whole Romantic sham!\" she passionately exclaims to Bernard. \"It's what happened to the Enlightenment, isn't it? A century of intellectual rigour turned in on itself. A mind in chaos suspected of genius ... The decline from thinking to feeling.\"\n\nAnother major theme is entropy and the irreversibility of time. Thomasina examines this scientifically, remarking that while Newtonian equations work both backwards and forwards, things in reality – like her rice pudding – cannot be \"unstirred.\" Heat, too, she notes, flows in only one direction (the second law of thermodynamics). This is embodied by the characters, who burn bridges in relationships, burn candles, and burn letters – and in the end, Thomasina herself (like a short-lived candle) burns to death.\n\nThomasina's insights into thermodynamics and heat transfer, and the idea that the universe is cooling, echo the poem \"Darkness\" by her \"real life\" contemporary, Lord Byron. Written in 1816 — the \"Year Without a Summer\", caused by atmospheric ash from the volcano Mount Tambora erupting in the Dutch East Indies — \"Darkness\" depicts a world grown dark and cold because the sun has been extinguished.\n\nThe play's end brings all these dichotomous themes together, showing that while things may appear to contradict — Romanticism and Classicism, intuition and logic, thought and feeling — they can exist, paradoxically, in the same time and space. Order is found amid the chaos.\n\nJim Hunter writes that \"Arcadia\" is a relatively realistic play, compared to Stoppard's other works, though the realism is \"much enhanced and teased about by the alternation of two eras\". The setting and characters are true-to-life, without being archetypal. It is comprehensible: the plot is both logical and probable, following events in a linear fashion. \"Arcadia\"'s major deviation from realism, of course, is in having two plotlines that are linear and parallel. Thus we see Thomasina deriving her mathematical equations to describe the forms of nature; we later see Val, with his computer, plotting them to produce the image of a leaf.\n\nThe language of \"Arcadia\" switches between the colloquialisms of early 19th century England and those of modern England. Stoppard's language reflects his periods, historical and modern, and he uses speech patterns and lexicons in keeping with his characters.\n\nBut his is a stylised dialogue, conveying the \"look and feel\" of the past as perceived by the modern audience. Still, it has sufficient latitude in register to make plain the relationships between the characters. For example, Septimus, after failing to deflect a question from Thomasina with a joke, bluntly explains to his pupil the nature of \"carnal embrace\" – but this bluntness is far removed from that with which he repudiates Chater's defence of his wife's honour (which he says \"could not be adequately defended with a platoon of musketry\"). With Lady Croom, who sees Mrs. Chater as a \"harlot\", Septimus delicately admits that \"her passion is not as fixed\" as one might wish.\n\nIn the modern sequences, the dialogue is more realistic. But Bernard consciously assumes some stylisation of language: He rehearses his public lecture in heightened, flamboyant rhetoric; and he unleashes a \"performance art\" polemic against Valentine's scientific thought, not from spite but for \"recreation\".\n\nThe play's scientific concepts are set forth primarily in the historical scenes, where Thomasina delivers her precocious (or even anachronistic) references to entropy, the deterministic universe and iterated equations in improvised, colloquial terms. In the modern era, Valentine explains the significance of Thomasina's rediscovered notebook with careful detail, reflecting Stoppard's research into his play's scientific materials.\n\nConsciously echoed phrases, across the time frames, help to unify the play. For example, Chloe asks Valentine if \"the future is all programmed like a computer\", and whether she is the first to think that theory discredited \"because of sex\". Thomasina has been there before: \"If you could stop every atom in its position and direction ... you could write the formula for all the future,\" she tells Septimus, then adds, \"Am I the first person to have thought of this?\" The difference is significant: Chloe's intuitive version allows for the effects of chaos, illustrating Stoppard's theme of the interdependence of science and art, and between professional and amateur thinking.\n\nThe play's title is abbreviated from its initial version: \"Et in Arcadia ego\". \"Arcadia\" refers to the pastoral ideal; the phrase literally translates, \"and in Arcadia I am\". The tradition of placing a tomb in a pastoral idyll can be traced to Virgil's \"Eclogues\", while the phrase first appears in Poussin's 1637 painting. Both the image and the motto are commonly considered a \"memento mori\", with the phrase being spoken by Death: \"I, too, am in Arcadia\". But the enigmatic phrase remains a subject of much academic discussion.\n\nLady Croom, enthusing about paintings of pretty landscapes, translates the phrase as \"Here I am in Arcadia!\" Thomasina drily comments, \"Yes Mama, if you would have it so\". Septimus notices; later, suspecting his pupil will appreciate the motto's true meaning, he offers the translation \"Even in Arcadia, there am I\". He is right – \"Oh, phooey to Death!\" she exclaims. Although these brief exchanges are the only direct references in the play to its title, they presage the two main characters' fates: Thomasina's early death, and Septimus's voluntary exile from life. Stoppard originally wanted to make this connection more explicit by using \"Et in Arcadia Ego\" for the title, but \"box office sense prevailed\".\n\nIn a more obvious sense, the title also invokes the ideal of nature as an ordered paradise, while the estate's landscape steadily evolves into a more irregular form. This provides a recurring image of the different ways in which \"true nature\" can be understood, and a homely parallel to Thomasina's theoretical description of the natural world's structure and entropic decline using mathematics.\n\nIn \"Arcadia\", Stoppard presents his audience with several highly complex but fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts. He also uses these theories and ideas to illuminate relationships among his characters, adding to their poignancy.\n\nOne of the play's main thematic concepts is chaos theory. Paul Edwards, in his essay \"Science in \"Hapgood\" and \"Arcadia\"\", notes that \"chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and random systems where entropy is high. [...] It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of classical physics), yet it finds regularities that prove to be the regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy\".\n\nJohn Fleming, in his book \"Stoppard's Theatre: Finding Order amid Chaos\", makes a similar observation. \"Deterministic chaos\", he writes, \"deals with systems of unpredictable determinism. ... [T]he uncertainty does not result in pure randomness, but rather in complex patterns. Traditionally, scientists expected dynamic systems to settle into stable, predictable behavior.\" But as systems respond to variations in input, they become more random or chaotic. \"Surprisingly, within these random states, windows of order reappear. [...] There is order in chaos — an unpredictable order, but a determined order nonetheless, and not merely random behavior.\"\n\nClosely related scientific and mathematical concepts in \"Arcadia\" are the second law of thermodynamics and entropy. Fleming describes these two principles. \"Entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The law of increase of entropy states that as a whole, the universe is evolving from order to disorder. This relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat spontaneously flows in only one direction, from hotter to colder. Since these equations, unlike Newton's laws of motion, do not go backward and forward, there is an 'arrow of time' that points toward the eventual 'heat death' of the universe.\"\n\nIn \"Arcadia\", Stoppard uses all these concepts to reveal that \"there is an underlying order to seemingly random events.\" The characters discuss these topics, while their interactions reflect them.\n\nSome ideas in the play recall Goethe's novella \"Elective Affinities\": Stoppard's characters \"Thomasina\" and \"Septimus\" have parallels in Goethe's \"Ottilie\" and \"Eduard\", and the historical section of Stoppard's play is set in 1809, the year of Goethe's novella. Among other parallels, the older work takes the theory of affinity between chemical elements as a metaphor for ineluctable, inevitable \"human chemistry\" in the same way as Stoppard makes use of the force of determinism acting on his characters. A feature of both works is the preoccupation with remodelling country house landscapes; Goethe's young character \"Ottilie\" (the counterpart to Thomasina) dies as an indirect result of this.\n\n\"Arcadia\" first opened at the Royal National Theatre in London on 13 April 1993, in a production directed by Trevor Nunn with Rufus Sewell as Septimus Hodge, Felicity Kendal as Hannah Jarvis, Bill Nighy as Bernard Nightingale, Emma Fielding as Thomasina Coverly, Alan Mitchell as Jellaby, Derek Hutchinson as Ezra Chater, Sidney Livingston as Richard Noakes, Harriet Walter as Lady Croom, Graham Sinclair as Captain Brice, Harriet Harrison as Chloe Coverly, Timothy Matthews as Augustus and Gus Coverly and Samuel West as Valentine Coverly. It won the 1993 Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for Best Play.\n\nThe first New York production opened in March 1995, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. It was again directed by Trevor Nunn, but with an entirely new cast. It starred Billy Crudup as Septimus, Blair Brown as Hannah, Victor Garber as Bernard, Robert Sean Leonard as Valentine and Jennifer Dundas as Thomasina. This production was the Broadway debut of Paul Giamatti, who played Ezra Chater. The other actors were Lisa Banes (Lady Croom), Richard Clarke (Jellaby), John Griffin (Gus/Augustus), Peter Maloney (Noakes), David Manis (Captain Brice, RN) and Haviland Morris (Chloe). This production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and was nominated for the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, losing to Terrence McNally's \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\".\n\nIn December 1996, the first major US regional production was mounted at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, a London production, directed by David Leveaux, opened at the Duke of York's Theatre starring Dan Stevens (Septimus Hodge), Samantha Bond (Hannah Jarvis), Jessie Cave (Thomasina Coverly), Nancy Carroll (Lady Croom), Trevor Cooper (Richard Noakes), Sam Cox (Jellaby), Lucy Griffiths (Chloë Coverly), Tom Hodgkins (Captain Brice), Hugh Mitchell (Augustus/Gus Coverly), Neil Pearson (Bernard Nightingale), George Potts (Ezra Chater) and Ed Stoppard (Valentine Coverly). The production recouped its costs and closed on 12 September 2009.\n\n\"Arcadia\" returned to Broadway, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, on 17 March 2011, again directed by David Leveaux. The cast included Margaret Colin (Lady Croom), Billy Crudup (Septimus in the original Broadway version, now playing Bernard Nightingale), Raúl Esparza (Valentine Coverly), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), Grace Gummer (Chloë Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), Bel Powley (Thomasina Coverly), Tom Riley (Septimus Hodge), Noah Robbins (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly), David Turner (Ezra Chater), and Lia Williams (Hannah Jarvis). The production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.\n\n\"The Times\", reviewing the first production in 1993, praised it as a \"perfect marriage of ideas and high comedy\". But for some, the ideas overwhelmed the comedy: \"[T]oo clever by about two-and-three-quarters,\" noted \"The Daily Mail\". \"One comes away instructed with more than one can usefully wish to know.\" After an eight-month run at the National, the play's transfer to the West End gave an opportunity for re-appraisal. \"The Daily Telegraph\" critic commented: \"I have never left a play more convinced that I had just witnessed a masterpiece\".\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the play as \"Tom Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and, new for him, emotion\". But other New York reviews were mixed or unfavourable, complaining of the anachronisms and lack of realism. The production left John Simon of \"New York Magazine\" with the view that \"Stoppard overdoes it…\"Arcadia\" makes better reading than seeing\".\n\nThe 2009 London revival prompted more critics to laud the play as \"Stoppard's finest work\". Michael Billington wrote in \"The Guardian\" that the play \"gets richer with each viewing. ... [T]here is poetry and passion behind the mathematics and metaphysics.\" Johann Hari of \"The Independent\" speculated that \"Arcadia\" would be recognised \"as the greatest play of its time\".\n\nThe 2011 Broadway staging met with a mixed reception. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" called the production \"a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard's entirely terrific \"Arcadia\"\", noting that \"several central roles are slightly miscast\", and \"some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence.\" Similar concerns were raised by critics from the \"New York\" magazine, \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"New York Daily News\", \"Time Out New York\" and Bloomberg News.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7411740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7411740", "title": "Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)", "text": "Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)\n\nThe Ars Magna (\"The Great Art\") is an important Latin-language book on algebra written by Girolamo Cardano. It was first published in 1545 under the title \"Artis Magnæ, Sive de Regulis Algebraicis Liber Unus\" (\"Book number one about The Great Art, or The Rules of Algebra\"). There was a second edition in Cardano's lifetime, published in 1570. It is considered one of the three greatest scientific treatises of the early Renaissance, together with Copernicus' \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" and Vesalius' \"De humani corporis fabrica\". The first editions of these three books were published within a two-year span (1543–1545).\n\nIn 1535 Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia became famous for having solved cubics of the form \"x\" + \"ax\" = \"b\" (with \"a\",\"b\" > 0). However, he chose to keep his method secret. In 1539, Cardano, then a lecturer in mathematics at the Piatti Foundation in Milan, published his first mathematical book, \"Pratica Arithmeticæ et mensurandi singularis\" (\"The Practice of Arithmetic and Simple Mensuration\"). That same year, he asked Tartaglia to explain to him his method for solving cubic equations. After some reluctance, Tartaglia did so, but he asked Cardano not to share the information until he published it. Cardano submerged himself in mathematics during the next several years working on how to extend Tartaglia's formula to other types of cubics. Furthermore, his student Lodovico Ferrari found a way of solving quartic equations, but Ferrari's method depended upon Tartaglia's, since it involved the use of an auxiliary cubic equation. Then Cardano became aware of the fact that Scipione del Ferro had discovered Tartaglia's formula before Tartaglia himself, a discovery that prompted him to publish these results.\n\nThe book, which is divided into forty chapters, contains the first published algebraic solution to cubic and quartic equations. Cardano acknowledges that Tartaglia gave him the formula for solving a type of cubic equations and that the same formula had been discovered by Scipione del Ferro. He also acknowledges that it was Ferrari who found a way of solving quartic equations.\n\nSince at the time negative numbers were not generally acknowledged, knowing how to solve cubics of the form \"x\" + \"ax\" = \"b\" did not mean knowing how to solve cubics of the form \"x\" = \"ax\" + \"b\" (with \"a\",\"b\" > 0), for instance. Besides, Cardano, also explains how to reduce equations of the form \"x\" + \"ax\" + \"bx\" + \"c\" = 0 to cubic equations without a quadratic term, but, again, he has to consider several cases. In all, Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen different types of cubic equations (chapters XI–XXIII).\n\nIn \"Ars Magna\" the concept of multiple root appears for the first time (chapter I). The first example that Cardano provides of a polynomial equation with multiple roots is \"x\" = 12\"x\" + 16, of which −2 is a double root.\n\n\"Ars Magna\" also contains the first occurrence of complex numbers (chapter XXXVII). The problem mentioned by Cardano which leads to square roots of negative numbers is: find two numbers whose sum is equal to 10 and whose product is equal to 40. The answer is 5 + √−15 and 5 − √−15. Cardano called this \"sophistic,\" because he saw no physical meaning to it, but boldly wrote \"nevertheless we will operate\" and formally calculated that their product does indeed equal 40. Cardano then says that this answer is “as subtle as it is useless”.\n\nIt is a common misconception that Cardano introduced complex numbers in solving cubic equations. Since (in modern notation) Cardano's formula for a root of the polynomial \"x\" + \"px\" + \"q\"  is\nsquare roots of negative numbers appear naturally in this context. However, \"q\"/4 + \"p\"/27 never happens to be negative in the specific cases in which Cardano applies the formula.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59338", "title": "Bracket", "text": "Bracket\n\nA bracket is a tall punctuation mark commonly used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. The matched pair is best described as \"opening\" and \"closing\". Less formally, in a left-to-right context, it may be described as \"left\" and \"right\", and in a right-to-left context, as \"right\" and \"left\".\n\nForms include round (also called \"parentheses\"), square, curly (also called \"braces\"), and angle brackets (also called \"chevrons\"), as well as various other pairs of symbols.\n\nIn addition to referring to the class of all types of brackets, the unqualified word \"bracket\" is most commonly used to refer to a specific type of bracket: in modern American usage, this is usually the square bracket and in modern British usage, this is usually the round bracket.\n\nChevrons (⟨ ⟩) were the earliest type of bracket to appear in written English. Desiderius Erasmus coined the term \"lunula\" to refer to the rounded parentheses (), recalling the shape of the crescent moon.\n\nSome of the following names are regional or contextual.\n\n\nThe characters ‹ › and « », known as s or angular quote brackets, are actually quotation mark glyphs used in several European languages. Which one of each pair is the opening quote mark and which is the closing quote varies between languages.\n\nSimilarly, the corner-brackets ｢ ｣ are quotation marks used in East Asian languages (see Quotation mark § Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks).\n\nIn English, typographers mostly prefer to not set brackets in italics, even when the enclosed text is italic. However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually set in italics too.\n\nParentheses (singular, parenthesis ) (also called simply brackets, or round brackets, curves, curved brackets, oval brackets, stalls or, colloquially, parens ) contain material that serves to clarify (in the manner of a gloss) or is aside from the main point. A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas as the delimiter, though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes, visual confusion may result.\n\nIn American usage, parentheses are usually considered separate from other brackets, and calling them \"brackets\" is unusual.\n\nParentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information, such as \"Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) spoke at length\". They can also indicate shorthand for \"either singular or plural\" for nouns, e.g. \"the claim(s)\". It can also be used for gender neutral language, especially in languages with grammatical gender, e.g. \"(s)he agreed with his (her) physician\".\n\nParenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature. Examples include the southern American author William Faulkner (see \"Absalom, Absalom!\" and ) as well as poet E. E. Cummings.\n\nParentheses have historically been used where the dash is currently used in alternatives, such as \"parenthesis)(parentheses\". Examples of this usage can be seen in editions of \"Fowler's\".\n\nParentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]).\n\nAny punctuation inside parentheses or other brackets is independent of the rest of the text: \"Mrs. Pennyfarthing (What? Yes, that was her name!) was my landlady.\" In this usage, the explanatory text in the parentheses is a parenthesis. (Parenthesized text is usually short and within a single sentence. Where several sentences of supplemental material are used in parentheses the final full stop would be within the parentheses, or simply omitted. Again, the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the text is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesized sentences removed.)\n\nIn more formal usage, \"parenthesis\" may refer to the entire bracketed text, not just to the punctuation marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be said to be \"a parenthesis\", \"a parenthetical\", or \"a parenthetical phrase\").\n\nLower-case Latin letters used as indexes, rather than bullets or numbers, followed by an unpaired parenthesis, are used in ordered lists especially in:\n\nSince 2014, antisemites have used triple parentheses around the names of people to denote them as Jewish.\n\nParentheses are used in mathematical notation to indicate grouping, often inducing a different order of operations. For example: in the usual order of algebraic operations, equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, equals 20, because the parentheses override normal precedence, causing the addition to be done first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when parentheses have one level of nesting, the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets. Example:\n\nA related convention is that when parentheses have two levels of nesting, curly brackets (braces) are the outermost pair. Following this convention, when more than three levels of nesting are needed, often a cycle of parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets will continue. This helps to distinguish between one such level and the next.\n\nParentheses are also used to set apart the arguments in mathematical functions. For example, is the function ' applied to the variable '. In coordinate systems parentheses are used to denote a set of coordinates; so in the Cartesian coordinate system may represent the point located at 4 on the \"x\"-axis and 7 on the \"y\"-axis. \n\nParentheses may also be used to represent a binomial coefficient.\n\nParentheses are included in the syntaxes of many programming languages. Typically needed to denote an argument; to tell the compiler what data type the Method/Function needs to look for first in order to initialise. In some cases, such as in LISP, parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language.\n\nParentheses are used in chemistry to denote a polyatomic ion. They can be used in various fields as notation to indicate the amount of uncertainty. For example:\nis equivalent to:\n\nMany online Roleplayers use double parentheses to connotate out-of-character (OOC) messages that one may send another.\n\nSquare brackets—also called crotchets or simply brackets (US)—are mainly used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author, or to mark modifications in quotations.\n\nA bracketed ellipsis, […], is often used to indicate omitted material: \"I'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance [...]\"\nBracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate when the original has been modified for clarity: \"I appreciate it [the honor], but I must refuse\", and \"the future of psionics [see definition] is in doubt\". Or one can quote the original statement \"I hate to do laundry\" with a (sometimes grammatical) modification inserted: He \"hate[s] to do laundry\".\n\nAdditionally, a small letter can be replaced by a capital one, when the beginning of the original text is omitted for succinctness, for example, when referring to a verbose original: \"To the extent that policymakers and elite opinion in general have made use of economic analysis at all, they have, as the saying goes, done so the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination\", it can be quoted succinctly as: \"[P]olicymakers […] made use of economic analysis […] the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.\" When nested parentheses are needed, brackets are used as a substitute for the inner pair of parentheses within the outer pair. When deeper levels of nesting are needed, convention is to alternate between parentheses and brackets at each level.\n\nAlternatively, empty square brackets can also indicate omitted material, usually single letter only. The original \"Reading is also a process and it also changes you.\" can be rewritten in a quote as: It has been suggested that reading can \"also change[] you\".\n\nThe bracketed expression \"[\"sic\"]\" is used after a quote or reprinted text to indicate the passage appears exactly as in the original source, where it may otherwise appear that a mistake has been made in reproduction.\n\nIn translated works, brackets are used to signify the same word or phrase in the original language to avoid ambiguity.\nFor example: \"He is trained in the way of the open hand [karate].\"\n\nBrackets (called \"move-left symbols\" or \"move right symbols\") are added to the sides of text in proofreading to indicate changes in indentation:\n\nBrackets are used in mathematics in a variety of notations, including standard notations for commutators, the floor function, the Lie bracket, equivalence classes, the Iverson bracket, and matrices. Square brackets may also represent closed intervals; formula_2 for example, represents the set of real numbers from 0 to 5 inclusive.\n\nBrackets can also be used in chemistry to represent the concentration of a chemical substance or to denote distributed charge in a complex ion.\n\nBrackets are used in many computer programming languages, primarily to force the order of evaluation and for parameter lists and array indexing. But they are also used to denote general tuples, sets and other structures, just as in mathematics. There may be several other uses as well, depending on the language at hand.\n\nIn linguistics, phonetic transcriptions are generally enclosed within brackets, often using the International Phonetic Alphabet, whereas phonemic transcriptions typically use paired slashes. Pipes (| |) are often used to indicate a morphophonemic rather than phonemic representation. Other conventions are double slashes (// //), double pipes (|| ||) and curly brackets ({ }). In lexicography, square brackets usually surround the section of a dictionary entry which contains the etymology of the word the entry defines.\n\nBrackets are used to denote parts of the text that need to be checked when preparing drafts prior to finalizing a document. They often denote points that have not yet been agreed to in legal drafts and the year in which a report was made for certain case law decisions.\n\nCurly brackets { and } are also called braces in the United States (or, colloquially, squiggly brackets). They are rarely used in prose and have no widely accepted use in formal writing, but may be used to mark words or sentences that should be taken as a group, to avoid confusion when other types of brackets are already in use, or for a special purpose specific to the publication (such as in a dictionary). More commonly, they are used to indicate a group of lines that should be taken together, as in when referring to several lines of poetry that should be repeated.\n\nIn music, they are known as accolades or \"braces\", and connect two or more lines (staves) of music that are played simultaneously.\n\nIn mathematics they delimit sets, and in writing, they may be used similarly, \"Select your animal {goat, sheep, cow, horse} and follow me\". In many programming languages, they enclose groups of statements and create a local scope. Such languages (C being one of the best-known examples) are therefore called curly bracket languages. In classical mechanics, curly brackets are often also used to denote the Poisson bracket between two quantities.\n\n , similar to the commonly used less-than (<) and greater-than sign (>), are often used to enclose highlighted material.\n\nIn physical sciences, chevrons are used to denote an average over time or over another continuous parameter. For example,\n\nThe inner product of two vectors is commonly written as , but the notation is also used.\n\nIn mathematical physics, especially quantum mechanics, it is common to write the inner product between elements as , as a short version of , or , where is an operator. This is known as Dirac notation or bra–ket notation.\n\nIn set theory, chevrons or parentheses are used to denote ordered pairs and other tuples, whereas curly brackets are used for unordered sets.\n\nIn linguistics, chevrons indicate graphemes (i.e., written letters) or orthography, as in \"The English word is spelled .\"\n\nIn epigraphy, they may be used for mechanical transliterations of a text into the Latin script.\n\nIn textual criticism, and hence in many editions of pre-modern works, chevrons denote sections of the text which are illegible or otherwise lost; the editor will often insert their own reconstruction where possible within them.\n\nChevrons are infrequently used to denote words that are thought instead of spoken, such as:\n\nThe mathematical or logical symbols for \"greater-than\" (>) and \"less-than\" (<) are inequality symbols; when either symbol is bisected by a vertical line, it represents \"not greater than\" or \"not less than,\" respectively. These symbols are not punctuation marks when used, as intended, to represent an inequality. However, as true chevrons are not present on computer keyboards, the available less-than and greater-than symbols are often used instead. They are loosely referred to as \"angle[d] brackets\" or \"chevrons\" in this case, but more properly — and less confusingly — as \"pointy brackets\" (see the Names section above).\n\nSingle and double pairs of comparison operators («, ») (meaning \"much smaller than\" and \"much greater than\") are sometimes used as a fallback instead of guillemets («, ») (used as quotation marks in many languages) when the proper characters are not available on the keyboard nor in the input editor. Similarly, early Internet messaging conventions developed to use the \"greater-than\" sign (>), available in the ASCII character set, to mark quoted lines. This format, known as Usenet quoting, is used by email clients when operating in plain text mode.\n\nIn comic books, chevrons are often used to mark dialogue that has been translated notionally from another language; in other words, if a character is speaking another language, instead of writing in the other language and providing a translation, one writes the translated text within chevrons. Of course, since no foreign language is actually written, this is only \"notionally\" translated.\n\nIn continuum mechanics, chevrons may be used as Macaulay brackets.\n\nIn East Asian punctuation, angle brackets are used as quotation marks. Chevron-like symbols are part of standard Chinese, and Korean punctuation, where they generally enclose the titles of books: ︿ and ﹀ or ︽ and ︾ for traditional vertical printing, and 〈 and 〉 or 《 and 》 for horizontal printing.\n\nSome East Asian languages use lenticular brackets 【 】, a combination of square brackets and round brackets called (\"fāngtóu kuòhào\") in Chinese and (\"sumitsuki\") in Japanese. and used in titles and headings in Japanese.\n\nThe floor corner brackets ⌊ and ⌋, the ceiling corner brackets ⌈ and ⌉ are used to denote the integer floor and ceiling functions.\n\nThe Quine corners ⌜ and ⌝ have at least two uses in mathematical logic: either as quasi-quotation, a generalization of quotation marks, or to denote the Gödel number of the enclosed expression.\n\nHalf brackets are used in English to mark added text, such as in translations: \"Bill saw ⸤her⸥\".\n\nIn editions of papyrological texts, half brackets, ⸤ and ⸥ or ⸢ and ⸣, enclose text which is lacking in the papyrus due to damage, but can be restored by virtue of another source, such as an ancient quotation of the text transmitted by the papyrus. For example, Callimachus \"Iambus\" 1.2 reads: ἐκ τῶν ὅκου βοῦν κολλύ⸤βου π⸥ιπρήσκουσιν. A hole in the papyrus has obliterated βου π, but these letters are supplied by an ancient commentary on the poem. Second intermittent sources can be between ⸢ and ⸣. Quine corners are sometimes used instead of half brackets.\n\nDouble brackets (or white square brackets), ⟦ ⟧, are used to indicate the \"semantic evaluation function\" in formal semantics for natural language and denotational semantics for programming languages. The brackets stand for a function that maps a linguistic expression to its “denotation” or semantic value. Double brackets may also refer to the mathematical floor function.\n\nKnown as \"spike parentheses\" () ⁅ and ⁆ are used in Swedish dictionaries.\n\nThe various bracket characters are frequently used in many programming languages as operators or for other syntax markup. For instance, in C-like languages, codice_1 and codice_2 are often used to delimit a code block, and the parameters of method calls are generally enclosed by codice_3 and codice_4.\n\nIn C, C++, Java and other C-derived languages—as well as in Scheme-influenced languages that have adopted C/Java syntax, such as JavaScript—the \"codice_5\" symbols are referred to as \"braces\" or \"curly braces\" and never as brackets. Since the term \"brace\" is documented in the definitive programming specifications for these languages, it is preferable to use the correct term brace so there is no confusion between the brace (used to denote compound statements) and the bracket, used to denote other concepts, such as array indices.\n\nIn addition to the use of parentheses to specify the order of operations, both parentheses and brackets are used to denote an interval, also referred to as a half-open range. The notation is used to indicate an interval from to that is inclusive of but exclusive of . That is, would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any finite number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation is also used for this. The endpoint adjoining the bracket is known as \"closed\", whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as \"open\". If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as \"closed\" or \"open\" as appropriate. Whenever +∞ or −∞ is used as an endpoint, it is normally considered \"open\" and adjoined to a parenthesis. See Interval (mathematics) for a more complete treatment.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, chevrons are also used as part of Dirac's formalism, bra–ket notation, to note vectors from the dual spaces of the Bra . Mathematicians will also commonly write for the inner product of two vectors. In statistical mechanics, chevrons denote ensemble or time average. Chevrons are used in group theory to write group presentations, and to denote the subgroup generated by a collection of elements. Note that obtuse angled chevrons are not always (and even not by all users) distinguished from a pair of less-than and greater-than signs <>, which are sometimes used as a typographic approximation of chevrons.\n\nIn group theory and ring theory, brackets denote the commutator. In group theory, the commutator is commonly defined as . In ring theory, the commutator is defined as . Furthermore, in ring theory, braces denote the anticommutator where is defined as . The bracket is also used to denote the Lie derivative, or more generally the Lie bracket in any Lie algebra.\n\nVarious notations, like the vinculum have a similar effect to brackets in specifying order of operations, or otherwise grouping several characters together for a common purpose.\n\nIn the Z formal specification language, braces define a set and chevrons define a sequence.\n\nTraditionally in accounting, contra amounts are placed in parentheses. A debit balance account in a series of credit balances will have brackets and vice versa.\n\nBrackets are used in some countries in the citation of law reports to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters. For example: Chronicle Pub. Co. v. Superior Court, (1998) 54 Cal.2d 548, [7 Cal.Rptr. 109]. In some other countries (such as England and Wales), square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given. For example, National Coal Board v England [1954] AC 403, is in the 1954 volume of the Appeal Cases reports although the decision may have been given in 1953 or earlier, whereas (1954) 98 Sol Jo 176 reports a decision from 1954, in volume 98 of the Solicitor's Journal which may be published in 1955 or later.\n\nWhen quoted material is in any way altered, the alterations are enclosed in brackets within the quotation. For example: Plaintiff asserts his cause is just, stating, \"[m]y causes is just.\" Although in the original quoted sentence the word \"my\" was capitalized, it has been modified in the quotation and the change signalled with brackets. Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error, the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with \"[\"sic\"]\" (Latin for 'thus'). (\"California Style Manual\", section 4:59 (4th ed.))\n\nTournament brackets, the diagrammatic representation of the series of games played during a tournament usually leading to a single winner, are so named for their resemblance to brackets or braces.\n\nRepresentations of various kinds of brackets in Unicode and HTML are given below.\n\nBraces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the IBM 7030 Stretch.\n\nThe angle brackets or chevrons at U+27E8 and U+27E9 are for mathematical use and Western languages, whereas U+3008 and U+3009 are for East Asian languages. The chevrons at U+2329 and U+232A are deprecated in favour of the U+3008 and U+3009 East Asian angle brackets. Unicode discourages their use for mathematics and in Western texts, because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300x and thus likely to render as double-width symbols. The \"less-than\" and \"greater-than\" symbols are often used as replacements for chevrons.\n\n\n\n"}

If it can take on two particular real values such that it can also take on all real values between them (even values that are arbitrarily close together), the variable is continuous in that interval. If it can take on a value such that there is a non-infinitesimal gap on each side of it containing no values that the variable can take on, then it is discrete around that value. In some contexts a variable can be discrete in some ranges of the number line and continuous in others.\n\nA continuous variable is one which can take on infinitely many, uncountable values.\n\nFor example, a variable over a non-empty range of the real numbers is continuous, if it can take on any value in that range. The reason is that any range of real numbers between formula_1 and formula_2 with formula_3 is infinite and uncountable.\n\nMethods of calculus are often used in problems in which the variables are continuous, for example in continuous optimization problems.\n\nIn statistical theory, the probability distributions of continuous variables can be expressed in terms of probability density functions.\n\nIn continuous-time dynamics, the variable \"time\" is treated as continuous, and the equation describing the evolution of some variable over time is a differential equation. The instantaneous rate of change is a well-defined concept.\n\nIn contrast, a discrete variable over a particular range of real values is one for which, for any value in the range that the variable is permitted to take on, there is a positive minimum distance to the nearest other permissible value. The number of permitted values is either finite or countably infinite. Common examples are variables that must be integers, non-negative integers, positive integers, or only the integers 0 and 1.\n\nMethods of calculus do not readily lend themselves to problems involving discrete variables. Examples of problems involving discrete variables include integer programming.\n\nIn statistics, the probability distributions of discrete variables can be expressed in terms of probability mass functions.\n\nIn discrete time dynamics, the variable \"time\" is treated as discrete, and the equation of evolution of some variable over time is called a difference equation.\n\nIn econometrics and more generally in regression analysis, sometimes some of the variables being empirically related to each other are 0-1 variables, being permitted to take on only those two values. A variable of this type is called a dummy variable. If the dependent variable is a dummy variable, then logistic regression or probit regression is commonly employed.\n"}
{"id": "2667603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2667603", "title": "Controversy over Cantor's theory", "text": "Controversy over Cantor's theory\n\nIn mathematical logic, the theory of infinite sets was first developed by Georg Cantor. Although this work has become a thoroughly standard fixture of classical set theory, it has been criticized in several areas by mathematicians and philosophers.\n\nCantor's theorem implies that there are sets having cardinality greater than the infinite cardinality of the set of natural numbers. Cantor's argument for this theorem is presented with one small change. This argument can be improved by using a definition he gave later. The resulting argument uses only five axioms of set theory.\n\nCantor's set theory was controversial at the start, but later became largely accepted. In particular, there have been objections to its use of infinite sets.\n\nCantor's first proof that infinite sets can have different cardinalities was published in 1874. This proof demonstrates that the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers have different cardinalities. It uses the theorem that a bounded increasing sequence of real numbers has a limit, which can be proved by using Cantor's or Richard Dedekind's construction of the irrational numbers. Because Leopold Kronecker did not accept these constructions, Cantor was motivated to develop a new proof.\n\nIn 1891, he published \"a much simpler proof … which does not depend on considering the irrational numbers.\" His new proof uses his diagonal argument to prove that there exists an infinite set with a larger number of elements (or greater cardinality) than the set of natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, …}. This larger set consists of the elements (\"x\", \"x\", \"x\", …), where each \"x\" is either \"m\" or \"w\". Each of these elements corresponds to a subset of N—namely, the element (\"x\", \"x\", \"x\", …) corresponds to {\"n\" ∈ N:  \"x\" = \"w\"}. So Cantor's argument implies that the set of all subsets of N has greater cardinality than N. The set of all subsets of N is denoted by \"P\"(N), the power set of N.\n\nCantor generalized his argument to an arbitrary set \"A\" and the set consisting of all functions from \"A\" to {0, 1}. Each of these functions corresponds to a subset of \"A\", so his generalized argument implies the theorem: The power set \"P\"(\"A\") has greater cardinality than \"A\". This is known as Cantor's theorem.\n\nThe argument below is a modern version of Cantor's argument that uses power sets (for his original argument, see Cantor's diagonal argument). By presenting a modern argument, it is possible to see which assumptions of axiomatic set theory are used. The first part of the argument proves that N and \"P\"(N) have different cardinalities:\n\nNext Cantor shows that formula_1 is equinumerous with a subset of formula_2. From this and the fact that formula_2 and formula_1 have different cardinalities, he concludes that formula_2 has greater cardinality than formula_1. This conclusion uses his 1878 definition: If \"A\" and \"B\" have different cardinalities, then either \"B\" is equinumerous with a subset of \"A\" (in this case, \"B\" has less cardinality than \"A\") or \"A\" is equinumerous with a subset of \"B\" (in this case, \"B\" has greater cardinality than \"A\"). This definition leaves out the case where \"A\" and \"B\" are equinumerous with a subset of the other set—that is, \"A\" is equinumerous with a subset of \"B\" and \"B\" is equinumerous with a subset of \"A\". Because Cantor implicitly assumed that cardinalities are linearly ordered, this case cannot occur. After using his 1878 definition, Cantor stated that in an 1883 article he proved that cardinalities are well-ordered, which implies they are linearly ordered. This proof used his well-ordering principle \"every set can be well-ordered\", which he called a \"law of thought\". The well-ordering principle is equivalent to the axiom of choice.\n\nAround 1895, Cantor began to regard the well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1895, Cantor also gave a new definition of \"greater than\" that correctly defines this concept without the aid of his well-ordering principle. By using Cantor's new definition, the modern argument that \"P\"(N) has greater cardinality than N can be completed using weaker assumptions than his original argument:\n\n\nBesides the axioms of infinity and power set, the axioms of separation, extensionality, and pairing were used in the modern argument. For example, the axiom of separation was used to define the diagonal subset formula_64 the axiom of extensionality was used to prove formula_65 and the axiom of pairing was used in the definition of the subset formula_35\n\nInitially, Cantor's theory was controversial among mathematicians and (later) philosophers. As Leopold Kronecker claimed: \"I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory – philosophy or theology, but I am sure that there is no mathematics there\". Many mathematicians agreed with Kronecker that the completed infinite may be part of philosophy or theology, but that it has no proper place in mathematics. Logician has commented on the energy devoted to refuting this \"harmless little argument\" (i.e. Cantor's diagonal argument) asking, \"what had it done to anyone to make them angry with it?\" Others have also taken issue with Cantor's proof regarding the cardinality of the power set. Mathematician Solomon Feferman has referred to Cantor's theories as “simply not relevant to everyday mathematics.”\n\nBefore Cantor, the notion of infinity was often taken as a useful abstraction which helped mathematicians reason about the finite world; for example the use of infinite limit cases in calculus. The infinite was deemed to have at most a potential existence, rather than an actual existence. \"Actual infinity does not exist. What we call infinite is only the endless possibility of creating new objects no matter how many exist already\". Carl Friedrich Gauss's views on the subject can be paraphrased as: 'Infinity is nothing more than a figure of speech which helps us talk about limits. The notion of a completed infinity doesn't belong in mathematics'. In other words, the only access we have to the infinite is through the notion of limits, and hence, we must not treat infinite sets as if they have an existence exactly comparable to the existence of finite sets.\n\nCantor's ideas ultimately were largely accepted, strongly supported by David Hilbert, amongst others. Hilbert predicted: \"No one will drive us from the paradise which Cantor created for us\". To which Wittgenstein replied \"if one person can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not another see it as a joke?\" The rejection of Cantor's infinitary ideas influenced the development of schools of mathematics such as constructivism and intuitionism.\n\nA common objection to Cantor's theory of infinite number involves the axiom of infinity (which is, indeed, an axiom and not a logical truth). Mayberry has noted that \"… the set-theoretical axioms that sustain modern mathematics are self-evident in differing degrees. One of them—indeed, the most important of them, namely Cantor's Axiom, the so-called Axiom of Infinity—has scarcely any claim to self-evidence at all …\"\n\nAnother objection is that the use of infinite sets is not adequately justified by analogy to finite sets. Hermann Weyl wrote:\nThe difficulty with finitism is to develop foundations of mathematics using finitist assumptions, that incorporates what everyone would reasonably regard as mathematics (for example, that includes real analysis).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8398", "title": "Dimension", "text": "Dimension\n\nIn physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.\n\nIn classical mechanics, space and time are different categories and refer to absolute space and time. That conception of the world is a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. The four dimensions of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe string theory, eleven dimensions can describe supergravity and M-theory, and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space.\n\nThe concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. s frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be parameter spaces or configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are abstract spaces, independent of the physical space we live in.\n\nIn mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of degrees of freedom of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent parameters or coordinates that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a line is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a plane is two, etc.\n\nThe dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a curve, such as a circle is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension lower than two, unless if it is a line.\n\nThe dimension of Euclidean -space is . When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question \"what makes -dimensional?\" One answer is that to cover a fixed ball in by small balls of radius , one needs on the order of such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the Minkowski dimension and its more sophisticated variant, the Hausdorff dimension, but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in looks locally like and this leads to the notion of the inductive dimension. While these notions agree on , they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.\n\nA tesseract is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term \"dimension\" is as in: \"A tesseract \"has four dimensions\"\", mathematicians usually express this as: \"The tesseract \"has dimension 4\"\", or: \"The dimension of the tesseract \"is\" 4\".\n\nAlthough the notion of higher dimensions goes back to René Descartes, substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of Arthur Cayley, William Rowan Hamilton, Ludwig Schläfli and Bernhard Riemann. Riemann's 1854 Habilitationsschrift, Schläfli's 1852 \"Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität\", and Hamilton's discovery of the quaternions and John T. Graves' discovery of the octonions in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.\n\nThe rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.\n\nThe dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the cardinality of a basis) is often referred to as the \"Hamel dimension\" or \"algebraic dimension\" to distinguish it from other notions of dimension. \n\nFor the non-free case, this generalizes to the notion of the length of a module.\n\nThe uniquely defined dimension of every connected topological manifold can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean -space, in which the number is the manifold's dimension.\n\nFor connected differentiable manifolds, the dimension is also the dimension of the tangent vector space at any point.\n\nIn geometric topology, the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the high-dimensional cases are simplified by having extra space in which to \"work\"; and the cases and are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the Poincaré conjecture, where four different proof methods are applied.\n\nThe dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined. While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the real numbers, it is sometimes useful in the study of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties to work over the complex numbers instead. A complex number (\"x\" + \"iy\") has a real part \"x\" and an imaginary part \"y\", where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension. \n\nConversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions. For example, an ordinary two-dimensional spherical surface, when given a complex metric, becomes a Riemann sphere of one complex dimension.\n\nThe dimension of an algebraic variety may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the tangent space at any Regular point of an algebraic variety. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of hyperplanes that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.\n\nAn algebraic set being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains formula_1 of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of \"formula_2\").\n\nEach variety can be considered as an algebraic stack, and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if \"V\" is a variety of dimension \"m\" and \"G\" is an algebraic group of dimension \"n\" acting on \"V\", then the quotient stack [\"V\"/\"G\"] has dimension \"m\"−\"n\".\n\nThe Krull dimension of a commutative ring is the maximal length of chains of prime ideals in it, a chain of length \"n\" being a sequence formula_3 of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.\n\nFor an algebra over a field, the dimension as vector space is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.\n\nFor any normal topological space , the Lebesgue covering dimension of is defined to be \"n\" if \"n\" is the smallest integer for which the following holds: any open cover has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than elements. In this case dim . For a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer exists, then the dimension of is said to be infinite, and one writes dim . Moreover, has dimension −1, i.e. dim if and only if is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all Tychonoff spaces merely by replacing the term \"open\" in the definition by the term \"functionally open\".\n\nAn inductive dimension may be defined inductively as follows. Consider a discrete set of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a \"new direction\", one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ()-dimensional object by dragging an -dimensional object in a \"new\" direction. The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the \"small inductive dimension\" or the \"large inductive dimension\", and is based on the analogy that balls have -dimensional boundaries, permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.\n\nSimilarly, for the class of CW complexes, the dimension of an object is the largest for which the -skeleton is nontrivial. Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be continuously deformed into a collection of higher-dimensional triangles joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially fractals. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all metric spaces and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values. The box dimension or Minkowski dimension is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of fractal dimensions that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.\n\nEvery Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis, and any two such bases for a particular space have the same cardinality. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's Hamel dimension is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.\n\nClassical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; \"i.e.\", moving in a linear combination of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See Space and Cartesian coordinate system.)\n\nA temporal dimension is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the \"fourth dimension\" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move in one direction.\n\nThe equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time, and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as charge and parity) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing entropy).\n\nThe best-known treatment of time as a dimension is Poincaré and Einstein's special relativity (and extended to general relativity), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional manifold, known as spacetime, and in the special, flat case as Minkowski space.\n\nIn physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four fundamental forces by introducing extra dimensions. Most notably, superstring theory requires 10 spacetime dimensions, and originates from a more fundamental 11-dimensional theory tentatively called M-theory which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be \"curled up\" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments such as those at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nAt the level of quantum field theory, Kaluza–Klein theory unifies gravity with gauge interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces electromagnetism. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe quantum gravity. Therefore, these models still require a UV completion, of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a Calabi–Yau manifold. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.\nIn addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be large extra dimensions. D-branes are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the brane by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or \"the bulk\". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.\n\nSome aspects of brane physics have been applied to cosmology. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.\n\nExtra dimensions are said to be universal if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.\n\nSome complex networks are characterized by fractal dimensions. The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space. The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.\n\nScience fiction texts often mention the concept of \"dimension\" when referring to parallel or alternate universes or other imagined planes of existence. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.\n\nOne of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella \"Flatland\" by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described \"Flatland\" as \"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\"\n\nThe idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in Miles J. Breuer's \"The Appendix and the Spectacles\" (1928) and Murray Leinster's \"The Fifth-Dimension Catapult\" (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s. Classic stories involving other dimensions include Robert A. Heinlein's \"—And He Built a Crooked House\" (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and Alan E. Nourse's \"Tiger by the Tail\" and \"The Universe Between\" (both 1951). Another reference is Madeleine L'Engle's novel \"A Wrinkle In Time\" (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for \"tesseracting the universe\" or \"folding\" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book \"The Boy Who Reversed Himself\" by William Sleator.\n\nImmanuel Kant, in 1783, wrote: \"That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition \"a priori\" because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain.\"\n\n\"Space has Four Dimensions\" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and experimental psychologist Gustav Fechner under the pseudonym \"Dr. Mises\". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, this \"shadow-man\" would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time. The story bears a strong similarity to the \"Allegory of the Cave\" presented in Plato's \"The Republic\" (c. 380 BC).\n\nSimon Newcomb wrote an article for the \"Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\" in 1898 entitled \"The Philosophy of Hyperspace\". Linda Dalrymple Henderson coined the term \"hyperspace philosophy\", used to describe writing that uses higher dimensions to explore metaphysical themes, in her 1983 thesis about the fourth dimension in early-twentieth-century art. Examples of \"hyperspace philosophers\" include Charles Howard Hinton, the first writer, in 1888, to use the word \"tesseract\"; and the Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky.\n\nZero\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\nHigher dimensionsin mathematics\nInfinite\n\n"}

Label each of the n crossings with the numbers 1, ..., 2\"n\" in order of traversal (each crossing is visited and labelled twice), with the following modification: if the label is an even number and the strand followed crosses over at the crossing, then change the sign on the label to be a negative. When finished, each crossing will be labelled a pair of integers, one even and one odd. The Dowker notation is the sequence of even integer labels associated with the labels 1, 3, ..., 2\"n\" − 1 in turn.\n\nFor example, a knot diagram may have crossings labelled with the pairs (1, 6) (3, −12) (5, 2) (7, 8) (9, −4) and (11, −10). The Dowker notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6 −12 2 8 −4 −10.\n\nA knot can be recovered from a Dowker sequence, but the recovered knot may differ from the original by being a reflection or (more generally) by having any connected sum component reflected in the line between its entry/exit points – the Dowker notation is unchanged by these reflections. Knots tabulations typically consider only prime knots and disregard chirality, so this ambiguity does not affect the tabulation.\n\nThe ménage problem, posed by Tait, concerns counting the number of different number sequences possible in this notation.\n\n\n"}

This is in contrast to card games such as blackjack, where the cards represent a 'memory' of the past moves. To see the difference, consider the probability for a certain event in the game. In the above-mentioned dice games, the only thing that matters is the current state of the board. The next state of the board depends on the current state, and the next roll of the dice. It doesn't depend on how things got to their current state. In a game such as blackjack, a player can gain an advantage by remembering which cards have already been shown (and hence which cards are no longer in the deck), so the next state (or hand) of the game is not independent of the past states.\n\nConsider a random walk on the number line where, at each step, the position (call it \"x\") may change by +1 (to the right) or −1 (to the left) with probabilities:\n\nFor example, if the constant, \"c\", equals 1, the probabilities of a move to the left at positions \"x\" = −2,−1,0,1,2 are given by formula_3 respectively. The random walk has a centering effect that weakens as \"c\" increases.\n\nSince the probabilities depend only on the current position (value of \"x\") and not on any prior positions, this biased random walk satisfies the definition of a Markov chain.\n\nThe probabilities of weather conditions (modeled as either rainy or sunny), given the weather on the preceding day,\ncan be represented by a transition matrix:\n\nThe matrix \"P\" represents the weather model in which a sunny day is 90%\nlikely to be followed by another sunny day, and a rainy day is 50% likely to\nbe followed by another rainy day. The columns can be labelled \"sunny\" and\n\"rainy\", and the rows can be labelled in the same order.\n\n(\"P\") is the probability that, if a given day is of type \"i\", it will be\nfollowed by a day of type \"j\".\n\nNotice that the rows of \"P\" sum to 1: this is because \"P\" is a stochastic matrix.\n\nThe weather on day 1 is known to be sunny. This is represented by a vector in which the \"sunny\" entry is 100%, and the \"rainy\" entry is 0%:\n\nThe weather on day 2 can be predicted by:\n\nThus, there is a 90% chance that day 2 will also be sunny.\n\nThe weather on day 3 can be predicted in the same way:\n\nor\n\nGeneral rules for day \"n\" are:\n\nIn this example, predictions for the weather on more distant days are increasingly\ninaccurate and tend towards a steady state vector. This vector represents\nthe probabilities of sunny and rainy weather on all days, and is independent\nof the initial weather.\n\nThe steady state vector is defined as:\n\nbut converges to a strictly positive vector only if \"P\" is a regular transition matrix (that is, there\nis at least one \"P\" with all non-zero entries).\n\nSince the q is independent from initial conditions, it must be unchanged when transformed by \"P\". This makes it an eigenvector (with eigenvalue 1), and means it can be derived from \"P\". For the weather example:\n\nand since they are a probability vector we know that \n\nSolving this pair of simultaneous equations gives the steady state distribution:\n\nIn conclusion, in the long term, about 83.3% of days are sunny.\n\n\n"}

As a specialization of risk management, financial risk management focuses on when and how to hedge using financial instruments to manage costly exposures to risk.\n\nIn the banking sector worldwide, the Basel Accords are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks.\n\nFinance theory (i.e., financial economics) prescribes that a firm should take on a project if it increases shareholder value. Finance theory also shows that firm managers cannot create value for shareholders, also called its investors, by taking on projects that shareholders could do for themselves at the same cost.\n\nWhen applied to financial risk management, this implies that firm managers should not hedge risks that investors can hedge for themselves at the same cost. This notion was captured by the so-called \"hedging irrelevance proposition\": \"In a perfect market, the firm cannot create value by hedging a risk when the price of bearing that risk within the firm is the same as the price of bearing it outside of the firm.\" In practice, financial markets are not likely to be perfect markets.\n\nThis suggests that firm managers likely have many opportunities to create value for shareholders using financial risk management, wherein they have to determine which risks are cheaper for the firm to manage than the shareholders. Market risks that result in unique risks for the firm are commonly the best candidates for financial risk management.\n\nThe concepts of financial risk management change dramatically in the international realm. Multinational Corporations are faced with many different obstacles in overcoming these challenges. There has been some research on the risks firms must consider when operating in many countries, such as the three kinds of foreign exchange exposure for various future time horizons: transactions exposure, accounting exposure, and economic exposure.\n\nFRM® (Certified Financial Risk Manager Program) is an international professional certification offered by GARP (The Global Association of Risk Professionals).

The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the Lasker–Noether theorem in algebraic geometry, and the ideal class group in algebraic number theory, of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential van der Waerden text on abstract algebra from around 1930.\n\nThe ideal theory in question had been based on elimination theory, but in line with David Hilbert's taste moved away from algorithmic methods. Gröbner basis theory has now reversed the trend, for computer algebra.\n\nThe importance of the ideal in general of a module, more general than an \"ideal\", probably led to the perception that \"ideal theory\" was too narrow a description. Valuation theory, too, was an important technical extension, and was used by Helmut Hasse and Oscar Zariski. Bourbaki used \"commutative algebra\"; sometimes \"local algebra\" is applied to the theory of local rings. D. G. Northcott's 1953 Cambridge Tract \"Ideal Theory\" (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.\n"}

{"id": "239290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239290", "title": "John Wallis", "text": "John Wallis\n\nJohn Wallis (; 3 December 1616 – 8 November 1703) was an English clergyman and mathematician who is given partial credit for the development of infinitesimal calculus. Between 1643 and 1689 he served as chief cryptographer for Parliament and, later, the royal court. He is credited with introducing the symbol ∞ to represent the concept of infinity. He similarly used 1/∞ for an infinitesimal.\n\nJohn Wallis was born in Ashford, Kent, the third of five children of Reverend John Wallis and Joanna Chapman. He was initially educated at a school in Ashford but moved to James Movat's school in Tenterden in 1625 following an outbreak of plague. Wallis was first exposed to mathematics in 1631, at Martin Holbeach's school in Felsted; he enjoyed maths, but his study was erratic, since \"mathematics, at that time with us, were scarce looked on as academical studies, but rather mechanical\" (Scriba 1970).\n\nAs it was intended he should be a doctor, he was sent in 1632 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there, he kept an \"act\" on the doctrine of the circulation of the blood; that was said to have been the first occasion in Europe on which this theory was publicly maintained in a disputation. His interests, however, centred on mathematics. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1637 and a Master's in 1640, afterwards entering the priesthood. From 1643 to 1649, he served as a nonvoting scribe at the Westminster Assembly. He was elected to a fellowship at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1644, from which he had to resign following his marriage.\n\nThroughout this time, Wallis had been close to the Parliamentarian party, perhaps as a result of his exposure to Holbeach at Felsted School. He rendered them great practical assistance in deciphering Royalist dispatches. The quality of cryptography at that time was mixed; despite the individual successes of mathematicians such as François Viète, the principles underlying cipher design and analysis were very poorly understood. Most ciphers were ad hoc methods relying on a secret algorithm, as opposed to systems based on a variable key. Wallis realised that the latter were far more secure – even describing them as \"unbreakable\", though he was not confident enough in this assertion to encourage revealing cryptographic algorithms. He was also concerned about the use of ciphers by foreign powers, refusing, for example, Gottfried Leibniz's request of 1697 to teach Hanoverian students about cryptography.\n\nReturning to London – he had been made chaplain at St Gabriel Fenchurch in 1643 – Wallis joined the group of scientists that was later to evolve into the Royal Society. He was finally able to indulge his mathematical interests, mastering William Oughtred's \"Clavis Mathematicae\" in a few weeks in 1647. He soon began to write his own treatises, dealing with a wide range of topics, which he continued for the rest of his life.\n\nWallis joined the moderate Presbyterians in signing the remonstrance against the execution of Charles I, by which he incurred the lasting hostility of the Independents. In spite of their opposition he was appointed in 1649 to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford University, where he lived until his death on 28 October 1703 (O.S.). In 1661, he was one of twelve Presbyterian representatives at the Savoy Conference.\n\nBesides his mathematical works he wrote on theology, logic, English grammar and philosophy, and he was involved in devising a system for teaching a deaf boy to speak at Littlecote House. William Holder had earlier taught a deaf man, Alexander Popham, to speak \"plainly and distinctly, and with a good and graceful tone\". Wallis later claimed credit for this, leading Holder to accuse Wallis of \"rifling his Neighbours, and adorning himself with their spoyls\".\n\nWallis made significant contributions to trigonometry, calculus, geometry, and the analysis of infinite series. In his \"Opera Mathematica\" I (1695) he introduced the term \"continued fraction\".\n\nWallis rejected as absurd the now usual idea of a negative number as being less than nothing, but accepted the view that it is something greater than infinity. (The argument that negative numbers are greater than infinity involves the quotient formula_1 and considering what happens as \"x\" approaches and then crosses the point \"x\" = 0 from the positive side.) Despite this he is generally credited as the originator of the idea of the number line, in which numbers are represented geometrically in a line with the negative numbers represented by lengths opposite in direction to lengths of positive numbers.\n\nIn 1655, Wallis published a treatise on conic sections in which they were defined analytically. This was the earliest book in which these curves are considered and defined as curves of the second degree. It helped to remove some of the perceived difficulty and obscurity of René Descartes' work on analytic geometry.\nIn the \"Treatise on the Conic Sections\" Wallis popularised the symbol ∞ for infinity. He wrote, “I suppose any plane (following the \"Geometry of Indivisibles\" of Cavalieri) to be made up of an infinite number of parallel lines, or as I would prefer, of an infinite number of parallelograms of the same altitude; (let the altitude of each one of these be an infinitely small part 1/∞ of the whole altitude, and let the symbol ∞ denote Infinity) and the altitude of all to make up the altitude of the figure.”\n\n\"Arithmetica Infinitorum\", the most important of Wallis's works, was published in 1656. In this treatise the methods of analysis of Descartes and Cavalieri were systematised and extended, but some ideas were open to criticism. He began, after a short tract on conic sections, by developing the standard notation for powers, extending them from positive integers to rational numbers:\n\nLeaving the numerous algebraic applications of this discovery, he next proceeded to find, by integration, the area enclosed between the curve \"y\" = \"x\", the axis of \"x\", and any ordinate \"x\" = \"h\", and he proved that the ratio of this area to that of the parallelogram on the same base and of the same height is 1/(\"m\" + 1), extending Cavalieri's quadrature formula. He apparently assumed that the same result would be true also for the curve \"y\" = \"ax\", where \"a\" is any constant, and \"m\" any number positive or negative, but he discussed only the case of the parabola in which \"m\" = 2 and the hyperbola in which \"m\" = −1. In the latter case, his interpretation of the result is incorrect. He then showed that similar results may be written down for any curve of the form\n\nand hence that, if the ordinate \"y\" of a curve can be expanded in powers of \"x\", its area can be determined: thus he says that if the equation of the curve is \"y\" = \"x\" + \"x\" + \"x\" + ..., its area would be \"x\" + x/2 + \"x\"/3 + ... He then applied this to the quadrature of the curves \"y\" = (\"x\" − \"x\"), \"y\" = (\"x\" − \"x\"), \"y\" = (\"x\" − \"x\"), etc., taken between the limits \"x\" = 0 and \"x\" = 1. He shows that the areas are, respectively, 1, 1/6, 1/30, 1/140, etc. He next considered curves of the form \"y\" = \"x\" and established the theorem that the area bounded by this curve and the lines \"x\" = 0 and \"x\" = 1 is equal to the area of the rectangle on the same base and of the same altitude as \"m\" : \"m\" + 1. This is equivalent to computing\n\nHe illustrated this by the parabola, in which case \"m\" = 2. He stated, but did not prove, the corresponding result for a curve of the form \"y\" = \"x\".\n\nWallis showed considerable ingenuity in reducing the equations of curves to the forms given above, but, as he was unacquainted with the binomial theorem, he could not effect the quadrature of the circle, whose equation is formula_11, since he was unable to expand this in powers of \"x\". He laid down, however, the principle of interpolation. Thus, as the ordinate of the circle formula_11 is the geometrical mean of the ordinates of the curves formula_13 and formula_14, it might be supposed that, as an approximation, the area of the semicircle formula_15 which is formula_16 might be taken as the geometrical mean of the values of\n\nthat is, 1 and formula_18; this is equivalent to taking formula_19 or 3.26... as the value of π. But, Wallis argued, we have in fact a series formula_20... and therefore the term interpolated between 1 and formula_21 ought to be chosen so as to obey the law of this series. This, by an elaborate method that is not described here in detail, leads to a value for the interpolated term which is equivalent to taking\n(which is now known as the Wallis product).\n\nIn this work also the formation and properties of continued fractions are discussed, the subject having been brought into prominence by Brouncker's use of these fractions.\n\nA few years later, in 1659, Wallis published a tract containing the solution of the problems on the cycloid which had been proposed by Blaise Pascal. In this he incidentally explained how the principles laid down in his \"Arithmetica Infinitorum\" could be used for the rectification of algebraic curves and gave a solution of the problem to rectify (i.e., find the length of) the semicubical parabola \"x\" = \"ay\", which had been discovered in 1657 by his pupil William Neile. Since all attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola had been (necessarily) ineffectual, it had been supposed that no curves could be rectified, as indeed Descartes had definitely asserted to be the case. The logarithmic spiral had been rectified by Evangelista Torricelli and was the first curved line (other than the circle) whose length was determined, but the extension by Neile and Wallis to an algebraic curve was novel. The cycloid was the next curve rectified; this was done by Christopher Wren in 1658.\n\nEarly in 1658 a similar discovery, independent of that of Neile, was made by van Heuraët, and this was published by van Schooten in his edition of Descartes's \"Geometria\" in 1659. Van Heuraët's method is as follows. He supposes the curve to be referred to rectangular axes; if this be so, and if (\"x\", \"y\") be the coordinates of any point on it, and \"n\" be the length of the normal, and if another point whose coordinates are (\"x\", η) be taken such that η : \"h\" = \"n\" : \"y\", where \"h\" is a constant; then, if \"ds\" be the element of the length of the required curve, we have by similar triangles \"ds\" : \"dx\" = \"n\" : \"y\". Therefore, \"h ds\" = η \"dx\". Hence, if the area of the locus of the point (\"x\", η) can be found, the first curve can be rectified. In this way van Heuraët effected the rectification of the curve \"y\" = \"ax\" but added that the rectification of the parabola \"y\" = \"ax\" is impossible. since it requires the quadrature of the hyperbola. The solutions given by Neile and Wallis are somewhat similar to that given by van Heuraët, though no general rule is enunciated, and the analysis is clumsy. A third method was suggested by Fermat in 1660, but it is inelegant and laborious.\n\nThe theory of the collision of bodies was propounded by the Royal Society in 1668 for the consideration of mathematicians. Wallis, Christopher Wren, and Christian Huygens sent correct and similar solutions, all depending on what is now called the conservation of momentum; but, while Wren and Huygens confined their theory to perfectly elastic bodies (elastic collision), Wallis considered also imperfectly elastic bodies (inelastic collision). This was followed in 1669 by a work on statics (centres of gravity), and in 1670 by one on dynamics: these provide a convenient synopsis of what was then known on the subject.\n\nIn 1685 Wallis published \"Algebra\", preceded by a historical account of the development of the subject, which contains a great deal of valuable information. The second edition, issued in 1693 and forming the second volume of his \"Opera\", was considerably enlarged. This algebra is noteworthy as containing the first systematic use of formulae. A given magnitude is here represented by the numerical ratio which it bears to the unit of the same kind of magnitude: thus, when Wallis wants to compare two lengths he regards each as containing so many units of length. This perhaps will be made clearer by noting that the relation between the space described in any time by a particle moving with a uniform velocity is denoted by Wallis by the formula\n\nwhere \"s\" is the number representing the ratio of the space described to the unit of length; while the previous writers would have denoted the same relation by stating what is equivalent to the proposition\n\nHe is usually credited with the proof of the Pythagorean theorem using similar triangles. However, Thabit Ibn Qurra (AD 901), an Arab mathematician, had produced a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem applicable to all triangles six centuries earlier. It is a reasonable conjecture that Wallis was aware of Thabit's work.\n\nWallis was also inspired by the works of Islamic mathematician Sadr al-Tusi, the son of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, particularly by al-Tusi's book written in AD 1298 on the parallel postulate. The book was based on his father's thoughts which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. After reading this, Wallis then wrote about his ideas as he developed his own thoughts about the postulate, trying to prove it also with similar triangles.\n\nHe found that Euclid's fifth postulate is equivalent to the one currently named \"Wallis postulate\" after him. This postulate states that \"On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle\". This result was encompassed in a trend trying to deduce Euclid's fifth from the other four postulates which today is known to be impossible. Unlike other authors, he realised that the unbounded growth of a triangle was not guaranteed by the four first postulates.\n\nAnother aspect of Wallis's mathematical skills was his ability to do mental calculations. He slept badly and often did mental calculations as he lay awake in his bed. One night he calculated in his head the square root of a number with 53 digits. In the morning he dictated the 27-digit square root of the number, still entirely from memory. It was a feat that was considered remarkable, and Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Royal Society, sent a colleague to investigate how Wallis did it. It was considered important enough to merit discussion in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" of the Royal Society of 1685.\n\nA long-running debate between Wallis and Thomas Hobbes arose in the mid-1650s, when mathematicians criticised errors in the work \"De corpore\" by Hobbes. It continued into the 1670s, having gathered in the later claims of Hobbes on squaring the circle, and the wider beliefs on both sides.\n\nWallis translated into Latin works of Ptolemy, Bryennius, and Porphyrius's commentary on Ptolemy. He also published three letters to Henry Oldenburg concerning tuning. He approved of equal temperament that was being used in England's organs.\n\nHis \"Institutio logicae\", published in 1687, was very popular. The \"Grammatica linguae Anglicanae\" was a work on English grammar, that remained in print well into the eighteenth century. He also published on theology.\n\nOn 14 March 1645 he married Susanna Glynde (16?? – 16 March 1687), They had three children:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34969712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34969712", "title": "Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics", "text": "Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics\n\nJorge Luis Borges and mathematics concerns several modern mathematical concepts found in certain essays and short stories of Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), including concepts such as set theory, recursion, chaos theory, and infinite sequences, although Borges' strongest links to mathematics are through Georg Cantor's theory of infinite sets, outlined in \"The Doctrine of Cycles\" (\"La doctrina de los ciclos\"). Some of Borges' most popular works such as \"The Library of Babel\" (\"La Biblioteca de Babel\"), \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" (\"El Jardín de Senderos que se Bifurcan\"), \"The Aleph\" (\"El Aleph\"), an allusion to Cantor's use of the Hebrew letter aleph (formula_1) to denote cardinality of transfinite sets, and \"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\" (\"El acercamiento a Almotásim\") illustrate his use of mathematics.\n\nAccording to Argentinian mathematician Guillermo Martínez, Borges at least had a knowledge of mathematics at the level of first courses in algebra and analysis at a university – covering logic, paradoxes, infinity, topology and probability theory. He was also aware of the contemporary debates on the foundations of mathematics. \n\nHis 1939 essay \"Avatars of the Tortoise\" (\"Avatares de la Tortuga\") is about infinity, and he opens by describing the book he would like to write on infinity: “five or seven years of metaphysical, theological, and mathematical training would prepare me (perhaps) for properly planning that book.” \n\nIn Borges' 1941 story, \"The Library of Babel\", the narrator declares that the collection of books of a fixed number of orthographic symbols and pages is unending. However, since the permutations of twenty-five orthographic symbols is finite, the library has to be periodic and self-repeating. \n\nIn his 1975 short story \"The Book of Sand\" (\"El Libro de Arena\"), he deals with another form of infinity; one whose elements are a dense set, that is, for any two elements, we can always find another between them. This concept was also used in the physical book the short-story came from, \"The Book of Sand\" book. The narrator describes the book as having pages that are \"infinitely thin\", which can be interpreted either as referring to a set of measure zero, or of having infinitesimal length, in the sense of second order logic.\n\nIn his 1936 essay \"The Doctrine of Cycles\" (\"La doctrina de los ciclos\"), published in his essay anthology of the same year Historia de la eternidad, Borges speculated about a universe with infinite time and finite mass: \"The number of all the atoms that compose the world is immense but finite, and as such only capable of a finite (though also immense) number of permutations. In an infinite stretch of time, the number of possible permutations must be run through, and the universe has to repeat itself. Once again you will be born from a belly, once again your skeleton will grow, once again this same page will reach your identical hands, once again you will follow the course of all the hours of your life until that of your incredible death.\" As usual with many of Borges' ideas and constructions, this line of thought was received as metaphysical speculation, a language and philosophical game. Yet almost one century later theoretical physicists are crossing the same paths, this time as a possible consequence of string theory: \"“Well, if the universe is really accelerating its expansion, then we know that it’s going to get infinitely large, and that things will happen over and over and over.” And if you have infinitely many tries at something, then every possible outcome is going to happen infinitely many times, no matter how unlikely it is.\".\n\nBorges in \"The Library of Babel\" states that \"The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any hexagon and whose circumference is unattainable\". The library can then be visualized as being a 3-manifold, and if the only restriction is that of being locally euclidean, it can equally well be visualized as a topologically non-trivial manifold such as a torus or a Klein bottle. \n\nIn his 1951 essay \"Pascal's sphere\" (\"La esfera de Pascal\"), Borges writes about a \"sphere with center everywhere and circumference nowhere\". A realization of this concept can be given by a sequence of spheres with contained centres and increasingly large radii, which eventually encompasses the entire space. This can be compared to the special point in \"The Aleph\" by the process of inversion.\n\nIn \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", Borges describes a novel by the fictional Chinese scholar Ts'ui Pên, whose plot bifurcates at every point in time. The idea of the flow of time branching can be compared to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and the notion of multiverses present in some versions of string theory. Similarly, the infinitude of diverging, infinite universes in mathematical cosmology is reflected Borges' rejection of linear, absolute time. Borges' writings address the nature of entity and the possibility of infinite \"realities\", as in his essay \"New Time Refutations\" (1946).\n\nBifurcation theory is a model in chaos theory of order appearing from a disordered system, and is a local theory that describes behavior of systems at local points. Borges anticipated the development of bifurcation theory in mathematics, through \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" in 1941. In \"Garden\", Borges captured the idea of a system splitting into multiple, uncorrelated states. For example, if a leaf floating in a river comes across a rock, it must flow across either side of the rock, and the two possibilities are statistically uncorrelated.\n"}

For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be\nmodeled by linear systems.\n\nA general deterministic system can be described by an operator, formula_1, that maps an input, formula_2, as a function of formula_3 to an output, formula_4, a type of black box description. Linear systems satisfy the property of superposition. Given two valid inputs \nas well as their respective outputs\nthen a linear system must satisfy\nfor any scalar values formula_10 and formula_11.\nThe system is then defined by the equation formula_12, where formula_4 is some arbitrary function of time, and formula_2 is the system state. Given formula_4 and formula_1, formula_2 can be solved for. For example, a simple harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation:\n\nIf\nthen formula_1 is a linear operator. Letting formula_21, we can rewrite the differential equation as formula_12, which shows that a simple harmonic oscillator is a linear system.\n\nThe behavior of the resulting system subjected to a complex input can be described as a sum of responses to simpler inputs. In nonlinear systems, there is no such relation. \nThis mathematical property makes the solution of modelling equations simpler than many nonlinear systems.\nFor time-invariant systems this is the basis of the impulse response or the frequency response methods (see LTI system theory), which describe a general input function formula_2 in terms of unit impulses or frequency components. \n\nTypical differential equations of linear time-invariant systems are well adapted to analysis using the Laplace transform in the continuous case, and the Z-transform in the discrete case (especially in computer implementations).\n\nAnother perspective is that solutions to linear systems comprise a system of functions which act like vectors in the geometric sense.\n\nA common use of linear models is to describe a nonlinear system by linearization. This is usually done for mathematical convenience.\n\nThe time-varying impulse response \"h\"(\"t\",\"t\") of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time \"t\" = \"t\" to a single impulse applied at time \"t\" = \"t\". In other words, if the input \"x\"(\"t\") to a linear system is \n\nwhere δ(\"t\") represents the Dirac delta function, and the corresponding response \"y\"(\"t\") of the system is\n\nthen the function \"h\"(\"t\",\"t\") is the time-varying impulse response of the system. Since the system cannot respond before the input is applied the following causality condition must be satisfied:\n\nThe output of any general continuous-time linear system is related to the input by an integral which may be written over a doubly infinite range because of the causality condition:\n\nIf the properties of the system do not depend on the time at which it is operated then it is said to be time-invariant and h() is a function only of the time difference τ = t-t' which is zero for τ<0 (namely t<t'). By redefinition of h() it is then possible to write the input-output relation equivalently in any of the ways,\n\nLinear time-invariant systems are most commonly characterized by the Laplace transform of the impulse response function called the \"transfer function\" which is:\n\nIn applications this is usually a rational algebraic function of s. Because h(t) is zero for negative t, the integral may equally be written over the doubly infinite range and putting s = iω follows the formula for the \"frequency response function\":\n\nThe output of any discrete time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution sum:\n\nor equivalently for a time-invariant system on redefining h(),\n\nwhere\n\nrepresents the lag time between the stimulus at time \"m\" and the response at time \"n\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3690584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3690584", "title": "List of first-order theories", "text": "List of first-order theories\n\nIn mathematical logic, a first-order theory is given by a set of axioms in some\nlanguage. This entry lists some of the more common examples used in model theory and some of their properties.\n\nFor every natural mathematical structure there is a signature σ listing the constants, functions, and relations of the theory together with their valences, so that the object is naturally a σ-structure. Given a signature σ there is a unique first-order language \"L\" that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the σ-structure.\n\nThere are two common ways to specify theories:\n\nAn L theory may:\n\nThe signature of the pure identity theory is empty, with no functions, constants, or relations.\n\nPure identity theory has no (non-logical) axioms. It is decidable.\n\nOne of the few interesting properties that can be stated in the language of pure identity theory is that of being infinite.\nThis is given by an infinite set of axioms stating there are at least 2 elements, there are at least 3 elements, and so on:\nThese axioms define the theory of an infinite set.\n\nThe opposite property of being finite cannot be stated in first-order logic for any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models: in fact any such theory has infinite models by the compactness theorem. In general if a property can be stated by a finite number of sentences of first-order logic then the opposite property can also be stated in first-order logic, but if a property needs an infinite number of sentences then its opposite property cannot be stated in first-order logic.\n\nAny statement of pure identity theory is equivalent to either σ(\"N\") or to ¬σ(\"N\") for some finite subset \"N\" of the non-negative integers, where σ(\"N\") is the statement that the number of elements is in \"N\". It is even possible to describe all possible theories in this language as follows. Any theory is either the theory of all sets of cardinality in \"N\" for some \"finite\" subset \"N\" of the non-negative integers, or the theory of all sets whose cardinality is not in \"N\", for some \"finite or infinite\" subset \"N\" of the non-negative integers. (There are no theories whose models are exactly sets of cardinality \"N\" if \"N\" is an infinite subset of the integers.) The complete theories are the theories of sets of cardinality \"n\" for some finite \"n\", and the theory of infinite sets.\n\nOne special case of this is the inconsistent theory defined by the axiom ∃\"x\" ¬\"x\" = \"x\". It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem is that it has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models. It is not the same as the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.\n\nA set of unary relations \"P\" for \"i\" in some set \"I\" is called independent if for every two disjoint finite subsets \"A\" and \"B\" of \"I\" there is some element \"x\" such that \"P\"(\"x\") is true for \"i\" in \"A\" and false for \"i\" in \"B\". Independence can be expressed by a set of first-order statements.\n\nThe theory of a countable number of independent unary relations is complete, but has no atomic models. It is also an example of a theory that is superstable but not totally transcendental.\n\nThe signature of equivalence relations has one binary infix relation symbol ~, no constants, and no functions. Equivalence relations satisfy the axioms:\n\nSome first order properties of equivalence relations are:\n\nThe theory of an equivalence relation with exactly 2 infinite equivalence classes is an easy example of a theory which is ω-categorical but not categorical for any larger cardinal.\n\nThe equivalence relation ~ should not be confused with the identity symbol '=': if \"x\"=\"y\" then \"x\"~\"y\", but the converse is not necessarily true. Theories of equivalence relations are not all that difficult or interesting, but often give easy examples or counterexamples for various statements.\n\nThe following constructions are sometimes used to produce examples of theories with certain spectra; in fact by applying them to a small number of explicit theories \"T\" one gets examples of complete countable theories with all possible uncountable spectra. If \"T\" is a theory in some language, we define a new theory 2 by adding a new binary relation to the language, and adding axioms stating that it is an equivalence relation, such that there are an infinite number of equivalence classes all of which are models of \"T\". It is possible to iterate this construction transfinitely: given an ordinal α, define a new theory by adding an equivalence relation \"E\" for each β<α, together with axioms stating that whenever β<γ then each \"E\" equivalence class is the union of infinitely many \"E\" equivalence classes, and each \"E\" equivalence class is a model of \"T\". Informally, one can visualize models of this theory as infinitely branching trees of height α with models of \"T\" attached to all leaves.\n\nThe signature of orders has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbols ≤. (It is of course possible to use ≥, < or > instead as the basic relation, with the obvious minor changes to the axioms.)\nWe define \"x\" ≥ \"y\", \"x\" < \"y\", \"x\" > \"y\" as abbreviations for \"y\" ≤ \"x\", \"x\" ≤ \"y\" ∧¬\"y\" ≤ \"x\", \"y\" < \"x\",\n\nSome first-order properties of orders: \nThe theory DLO of \"dense linear orders without endpoints\" (i.e. no smallest or largest element) is complete, ω-categorical, but not categorical for any uncountable cardinal. There are 3 other very similar theories: the theory of dense linear orders with a:\n\nBeing well ordered (\"any non-empty subset has a minimal element\") is not a first-order property; the usual definition involves quantifying over all \"subsets\".\n\nLattices can be considered either as special sorts of partially ordered sets, with a signature consisting of one binary relation symbol ≤, or as algebraic structures with a signature consisting of two binary operations ∧ and ∨. The two approaches can be related by defining \"a\"≤ \"b\" to mean \"a\"∧\"b\"=\"a\".\n\nFor two binary operations the axioms for a lattice are:\nFor one relation ≤ the axioms are:\n\nFirst order properties include:\n\nHeyting algebras can be defined as lattices with certain extra first-order properties.\n\nCompleteness is not a first order property of lattices.\n\nThe signature of graphs has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbol \"R\", where \"R\"(\"x\",\"y\") is read as \"there is an edge from \"x\" to \"y\"\".\n\nThe axioms for the theory of graphs are\n\nThe \"theory of random graphs\" has the following extra axioms for each positive integer \"n\":\n\nThe theory of random graphs is ω categorical, complete, and decidable, and its countable model is called the Rado graph. A statement in the language of graphs is true in this theory if and only if the probability that an \"n\"-vertex random graph models the statement tends to 1 in the limit as \"n\" goes to infinity.\n\nThere are several different signatures and conventions used for Boolean algebras: \n\nThe axioms are:\n\nTarski proved that the theory of Boolean algebras is decidable.\n\nWe write \"x\" ≤ \"y\" as an abbreviation for \"x\" ∧ \"y\" = \"x\", and atom(\"x\") as an abbreviation for ¬\"x\" = 0 ∧ ∀\"y\" \"y\"≤\"x\" → \"y\" = 0 ∨ \"y\" = \"x\", read as \"\"x\" is an atom\", in other words a non-zero element with nothing between it and 0. Here are some first-order properties of Boolean algebras:\nThe theory of atomless Boolean algebras is ω-categorical and complete.\n\nFor any Boolean algebra \"B\", there are several invariants defined as follows. \n\nThen two Boolean algebras are elementarily equivalent if and only if their invariants \"l\", \"m\", and \"n\" are the same. In other words, the values of these invariants classify the possible completions of the theory of Boolean algebras. So the possible complete theories are:\n\nThe signature of group theory has one constant 1 (the identity), one function of arity 1\n(the inverse) whose value on \"t\" is denoted by \"t\", and one function \nof arity 2, which is usually omitted from terms. For any integer \"n\". \"t\" is an abbreviation for the obvious term for the \"n\"th power of \"t\".\n\nGroups are defined by the axioms\n\nSome properties of groups that can be defined in the first-order language of groups are:\n\nThe theory of abelian groups is decidable. The theory of infinite divisible torsion-free abelian groups is complete, as is the theory of infinite abelian groups of exponent p (for \"p\" prime).\n\nThe theory of finite groups is the set of first-order statements in the language of groups that are true in all finite groups (there are plenty of infinite models of this theory). It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is \n\"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them\".\n\nThe properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. More precisely, the first-order theory of all groups with one of these properties has models that do not have this property.\n\nThe signature of (unital) rings has 2 constants 0 and 1, two binary functions + and ×, and, optionally, one unary negation function −.\n\nRings\n\nAxioms: Addition makes the ring into an abelian group, multiplication is associative and has an identity 1, and multiplication is left and right distributive.\n\nCommutative rings\n\nThe axioms for rings plus ∀\"x\" ∀\"y\" \"xy\"=\"yx\".\n\nFields\n\nThe axioms for commutative rings plus ∀\"x\" ¬ \"x\"=0 → ∃\"y\" \"xy\"=1 and ¬ 1=0. Many of the examples given here have only universal, or \"algebraic\" axioms. The class of structures satisfying such a theory has the property of being closed under substructure. For example, a subset of a group closed under the group actions of multiplication and inverse is again a group. Since the signature of fields does not usually include multiplicative and additive inverse, the axioms for inverses are not universal, and therefore a substructure of a field closed under addition and multiplication is not always a field. This can be remedied by adding unary inverse functions to the language.\n\nFor any positive integer \"n\" the property that all equations of degree \"n\" have a root can be expressed by a single first-order sentence:\n\nPerfect fields\n\nThe axioms for fields, plus axioms for each prime number \"p\" stating that if p 1 = 0 (i.e. the field has characteristic \"p\"), then every field element has a \"p\"th root.\n\nAlgebraically closed fields of characteristic \"p\"\n\nThe axioms for fields, plus for every positive \"n\" the axiom that all polynomials of degree \"n\" have a root, plus axioms fixing the characteristic. The classical examples of complete theories. Categorical in all uncountable cardinals. The theory \"ACF\" has a \"universal domain property\", in the sense that every structure \"N\" satisfying the universal axioms of \"ACF\" is a substructure of a sufficiently large algebraically closed field formula_5, and additionally any two such embeddings \"N\" → \"M\" induce an automorphism of \"M\".\n\nFinite fields\n\nThe theory of finite fields is the set of all first-order statements that are true in all finite fields. Significant examples of such statements can, for example, be given by applying the Chevalley–Warning theorem, over the prime fields. The name is a little misleading as the theory has plenty of infinite models. Ax proved that the theory is decidable.\n\nFormally real fields\n\nThese are fields with the axiom \n\nReal closed fields\n\nAxioms: *∀\"x\" ∃\"y\" \"x\"=\"yy\" ∨ \"x\"+\"yy\"= 0.\n\nThe theory of real closed fields is effective and complete and therefore decidable (the Tarski–Seidenberg theorem). The addition of further function symbols (e.g., the exponential function, the sine function) may change decidability. \n\nAxioms for various systems of geometry usually use a typed language, with the different types corresponding to different geometric objects such as points, lines, circles, planes, and so on. The signature will often consist of binary incidence relations between objects of different types; for example, the relation that a point lies on a line. The signature may have more complicated relations; for example ordered geometry might have a ternary \"betweenness\" relation for 3 points, which says whether one lies between two others, or a \"congruence\" relation between 2 pairs of points.\n\nSome examples of axiomatized systems of geometry include ordered geometry, absolute geometry, affine geometry, Euclidean geometry, projective geometry, and hyperbolic geometry. For each of these geometries there are many different and inequivalent systems of axioms for various dimensions. Some of these axiom systems include \"completeness\" axioms that are not first order.\n\nAs a typical example, the axioms for projective geometry use 2 types, points and lines, and a binary incidence relation between points and lines. If point and line variables are indicated by small and capital letter, and \"a\" incident to \"A\" is written as \"aA\", then one set of axioms is\n\nEuclid did not state all the axioms for Euclidean geometry explicitly, and the first complete list was given by Hilbert in Hilbert's axioms. This is not a first order axiomatization as one of Hilbert's axioms is a second order completeness axiom. Tarski's axioms are a first order axiomatization of Euclidean geometry. Tarski showed this axiom system is complete and decidable by relating it to the complete and decidable theory of real closed fields.\n\nThe signature is that of fields (0, 1, +, −, ×) together with a unary function ∂, the derivation.\nThe axioms are those for fields together with\nFor this theory one can add the condition that the characteristic is \"p\", a prime or zero,\nto get the theory DF of differential fields of characteristic \"p\" (and similarly with the other theories below).\n\nIf \"K\" is a differential field then the field of constants formula_12\nThe theory of differentially perfect fields is the theory of differential fields together with the condition that the field of constants is perfect; in other words, for each prime \"p\" it has the axiom:\nFor technical reasons to do with quantifier elimination, it is sometimes more convenient to force the constant field to be perfect by adding a new symbol \"r\" to the signature with the axioms\n\nThe theory of the natural numbers with a successor function has signature consisting of a constant 0 and a unary function \"S\" (\"successor\": \"S\"(\"x\") is interpreted as \"x\"+1), and has axioms:\nThe last axiom (induction) can be replaced by the axioms\n\nThe theory of the natural numbers with a successor function is complete and decidable, and is κ-categorical for uncountable κ but not for countable κ.\n\nPresburger arithmetic is the theory of the natural numbers under addition, with signature consisting of a constant 0, a unary function \"S\", and a binary function +. It is complete and decidable. The axioms are \n\nMany of the first order theories described above can be extended to complete recursively enumerable consistent theories. This is no longer true for most of the following theories; they can usually encode both multiplication and addition of natural numbers, and this gives them enough power to encode themselves, which implies that Gödel's incompleteness theorem applies and the theories can no longer be both complete and recursively enumerable (unless they are inconsistent).\n\nThe signature of a theory of arithmetic has:\nSome authors take the signature to contain a constant 1 instead of the function \"S\", then define \"S\" in the obvious way as \"St\" = 1 + \"t\".\n\nRobinson arithmetic (also called Q). Axioms (1) and (2) govern the distinguished element 0. (3) assures that \"S\" is an injection. Axioms (4) and (5) are the standard recursive definition of addition; (6) and (7) do the same for multiplication. Robinson arithmetic can be thought of as Peano arithmetic without induction. Q is a weak theory for which Gödel's incompleteness theorem holds.\nAxioms:\n\nIΣ is first order Peano arithmetic with induction restricted to Σ formulas (for \"n\" = 0, 1, 2, ...). The theory IΣ is often denoted by IΔ. This is a series of more and more powerful fragments of Peano arithmetic. The case \"n\" = 1 has about the same strength as primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA).\nExponential function arithmetic (EFA) is IΣ with an axiom stating that \"x\" exists for all \"x\" and \"y\" (with the usual properties).\n\nFirst order Peano arithmetic, PA. The \"standard\" theory of arithmetic. The axioms are the axioms of Robinson arithmetic above, together with the axiom scheme of induction:\nKurt Gödel's 1931 paper proved that PA is incomplete, and has no consistent recursively enumerable completions.\n\nComplete arithmetic (also known as true arithmetic) is the theory of the standard model of arithmetic, the natural numbers N. It is complete but does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms.\n\nFor the real numbers, the situation is slightly different: The case that includes just addition and multiplication cannot encode the integers, and hence Gödel's incompleteness theorem does not apply. Complications arise when adding further function symbols (e.g., exponentiation).\n\nSecond-order arithmetic can refer to a first order theory (in spite of the name) with two types of variables, thought of as varying over integers and subsets of the integers. (There is also a theory of arithmetic in second order logic that is called second order arithmetic. It has only one model, unlike the corresponding theory in first order logic, which is incomplete.) The signature will typically be the signature 0, \"S\", +, × of arithmetic, together with a membership relation ∈ between integers and subsets (though there are numerous minor variations). The axioms are those of Robinson arithmetic, together with axiom schemes of induction and comprehension.\n\nThere are many different subtheories of second order arithmetic that differ in which formulas are allowed in the induction and comprehension schemes. \nIn order of increasing strength, five of the most common systems\nare \nThese are defined in detail in the articles on second order arithmetic and reverse mathematics.\n\nThe usual signature of set theory has one binary relation ∈, no constants, and no functions. Some of the theories below are \"class theories\" which have two sorts of object, sets and classes. There are three common ways of handling this in first-order logic:\n\nSome first order set theories include:\n\nSome extra first order axioms that can be added to one of these (usually ZF) include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "221484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221484", "title": "Math rock", "text": "Math rock\n\nMath rock is a style of indie rock that emerged in the late 1980s in the United States, influenced by post-hardcore, progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, and 20th century minimal music composers such as Steve Reich. Math rock is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, angular melodies, and extended, often dissonant, chords. It bears similarities to post-rock.\n\nWhereas most rock music uses a 4/4 meter (however accented or syncopated), math rock frequently uses non-standard time signatures such as 7/8, 11/8, or 13/8, or features constantly changing meters based on various groupings of 2 and 3. This rhythmic complexity, seen as \"mathematical\" in character by many listeners and critics, is what gives the genre its name.\n\nThe sound is usually dominated by guitars and drums as in traditional rock, and because of the complex rhythms, the drums section of math rock groups tend to be more salient than in other genres. It is commonplace to find guitarists in math rock groups using the tapping technique of guitar playing, and loop pedals are occasionally incorporated, as by the band Battles. Guitars are also often played in clean tones more than in other upbeat rock songs, but some groups also use distortion.\n\nLyrics are generally not the focus of math rock; the voice is treated as just another sound in the mix. Often, vocals are not overdubbed, and are positioned low in the mix, as in the recording style of Steve Albini, or Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller. Many of math rock's most famous groups are entirely instrumental such as Don Caballero or Hella, though both have experimented with singing to varying degrees.\n\nThe term \"math rock\" has often been passed off as a joke that has developed into what some believe is a musical style. An advocate of this is Matt Sweeney, singer with Chavez, who themselves were often linked to the math rock scene.\n\nA significant intersect exists between math rock and emo, exemplified by bands such as Tiny Moving Parts or American Football, whose sound was described as \"twinkly, mathy rock, a sound that became one of the defining traits of the emo scene throughout the 2000s\".\n\nThe Canadian punk rock group Nomeansno (founded in 1979 and inactive as of 2016) have been cited by music critics as a \"secret influence\" on math rock, predating much of the genre's development by more than a decade. An even more avant-garde group of the same era, Massacre, featured the guitarist Fred Frith and the bassist Bill Laswell. With some influence from the rapid-fire energy of punk, Massacre's influential music used complex rhythmic characteristics. Black Flag's 1984 album \"My War\" also included unusual polyrhythms.\n\nBands such as Because of Ghosts, The Sinking Citizenship, and My Disco emerged in the early 2000s in Melbourne.\n\nThe European math rock scene started in the late 90s to early 2000, including bands such as Adebisi Shank (Ireland), Kobong (Poland), The Redneck Manifesto (Ireland), Three Trapped Tigers and This Town Needs Guns (United Kingdom) and Uzeda (Italy). Foals (England) was formed in 2005.\n\nThe most significant Japanese groups include Ruins, Zeni Geva, Boredoms, Aburadako, Tricot and Doom. Yona-Kit is a collaboration between Japanese and U.S. musicians. Other Japanese groups which incorporate math rock in their music include Ling Tosite Sigure, Toe, Zazen Boys, Lite and Mouse on the Keys. Skin Graft Records and Tzadik Records have released Japanese math rock albums in the United States.\n\nThe city of Pittsburgh is home to Don Caballero—whose drummer, Damon Che, is also involved with the international math rock band Bellini as well as Black Moth Super Rainbow, Tabula Rasa, and Knot Feeder. Bands from Washington, D.C. include The Dismemberment Plan, Shudder to Think, Hoover, Faraquet, 1.6 Band, Autoclave, later Jawbox, and Circus Lupus. Polvo of Chapel Hill, North Carolina is often considered math rock, although the band has disavowed that categorization.\n\nIn California, math rock groups from San Diego include Upsilon Acrux, Drive Like Jehu, Antioch Arrow, Tristeza, No Knife, Heavy Vegetable, Sleeping People, Tera Melos, and Chon. Northern California was the base of Game Theory and The Loud Family, both led by Scott Miller, who was said to \"tinker with pop the way a born mathematician tinkers with numbers\". The origin of Game Theory's name is mathematical, suggesting a \"nearly mathy\" sound cited as \"IQ rock\".\n\nBy the turn of the 21st century, most of the later generation bands such as Sweep the Leg Johnny had disbanded and the genre had been roundly disavowed by most bands labeled with the \"math rock\" moniker. Bands in the late 90's and 2000s, such as This Town Needs Guns and American Football, began combining math rock and emo, creating a much more vocally oriented sound.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, many math rock bands enjoyed renewed popularity. Slint and Chavez embarked on reunion tours, while Shellac toured and released their first album in seven years. Don Caballero reunited with a new lineup and released an album in 2006, while several of its original members joined new projects, such as the band Knot Feeder.\n\n\n"}

Important problems include multiscale modeling of fluids, solids, polymers, proteins, nucleic acids as well as various physical and chemical phenomena (like adsorption, chemical reactions, diffusion).\n\nHorstemeyer 2009, 2012 presented a historical review of the different disciplines (solid mechanics, numerical methods, mathematics, physics, and materials science) for solid materials related to multiscale materials modeling.\n\nThe aforementioned DOE multiscale modeling efforts were hierarchical in nature. The first concurrent multiscale model occurred when Michael Ortiz (Caltech) took the molecular dynamics code, Dynamo, (developed by Mike Baskes at Sandia National Labs) and with his students embedded it into a finite element code for the first time. Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, Arieh Warshel 2013 were awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a multiscale model method using both classical and quantum mechanical theory which were used to model large complex chemical systems and reactions.\n\nIn physics and chemistry, multiscale modeling is aimed to calculation of material properties or system behavior on one level using information or models from different levels. On each level particular approaches are used for description of a system. The following levels are usually distinguished: level of quantum mechanical models (information about electrons is included), level of molecular dynamics models (information about individual atoms is included), coarse-grained models (information about atoms and/or groups of atoms is included), mesoscale or nano level (information about large groups of atoms and/or molecule positions is included), level of continuum models, level of device models. Each level addresses a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time. Multiscale modeling is particularly important in integrated computational materials engineering since it allows the prediction of material properties or system behavior based on knowledge of the process-structure-property relationships.\n\nIn operations research, multiscale modeling addresses challenges for decision makers which come from multiscale phenomena across organizational, temporal and spatial scales. This theory fuses decision theory and multiscale mathematics and is referred to as multiscale decision-making. Multiscale decision-making draws upon the analogies between physical systems and complex man-made systems.\n\nIn meteorology, multiscale modeling is the modeling of interaction between weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales that produces the weather that we experience. The most challenging task is to model the way through which the weather systems interact as models cannot see beyond the limit of the model grid size. In other words, to run an atmospheric model that is having a grid size (very small ~ ) which can see each possible cloud structure for the whole globe is computationally very expensive. On the other hand, a computationally feasible Global climate model (GCM), with grid size ~ , cannot see the smaller cloud systems. So we need to come to a balance point so that the model becomes computationally feasible and at the same time we do not lose much information, with the help of making some rational guesses, a process called Parametrization.\n\nBesides the many specific applications, one area of research is methods for the accurate and efficient solution of multiscale modeling problems. The primary areas of mathematical and algorithmic development include:\n\n\n\n"}

Now, the closure of the image of this map together with the projection to \"X\" is called the Nash blowing-up of \"X\".\n\nAlthough (to emphasize its geometric interpretation) an embedding was used to define the Nash embedding it is possible to prove that it doesn't depend on it. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "169319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169319", "title": "Necessity and sufficiency", "text": "Necessity and sufficiency\n\nIn logic, necessity and sufficiency are terms used to describe a conditional or implicational relationship between statements. For example, in the conditional statement \"If P then Q\", we say that \"Q is necessary for P\" because P cannot be true unless Q is true. Similarly, we say that \"P is sufficient for Q\" because P being true always implies that Q is true, but P not being true does not always imply that Q is not true. \n\nThe assertion that a statement is a \"necessary \"and\" sufficient\" condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false. \n\nIn ordinary English, \"necessary\" and \"sufficient\" indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.\n\nIn the conditional statement, \"if \"S\", then \"N\", the expression represented by \"S\" is called the antecedent and the expression represented by \"N\" is called the consequent. This conditional statement may be written in many equivalent ways, for instance, \"N\" if \"S\", \"S\" only if \"N\", \"S\" implies \"N\", \"N\" is implied by \"S\", , , or \"N\" whenever \"S\"\".\n\nIn the above situation, we also say that \"N\" is a necessary condition for \"S\". In common language this is saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent \"N\" must be true if \"S\" may at all be true (see \"truth table\" immediately below). Phrased differently, the antecedent \"S\" cannot be true without \"N\" being true. For example, in order for someone to be called Socrates, it is necessary for that someone to be Named.\n\nWe also say that \"S\" is a sufficient condition for \"N\". Consider the truth table again. If the conditional statement is true, then if \"S\" is true, \"N\" must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or be false. In common terms, \"\"S\" guarantees \"N\". Continuing the example, knowing that someone is called Socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a Name.\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications formula_1 and formula_2 (which can also be written as formula_3) hold. From the first of these we see that \"S\" is a sufficient condition for \"N\", and from the second that \"S\" is a necessary condition for \"N\". This is expressed as \"S\" is necessary and sufficient for \"N\" \", \"\"S\" if and only if \"N\" \", or formula_4.\n\nThe assertion that \"Q\" is necessary for \"P\" is colloquially equivalent to \"\"P\" cannot be true unless \"Q\" is true\" or \"if Q is false, then P is false\". By contraposition, this is the same thing as \"whenever \"P\" is true, so is \"Q\"\".\n\nThe logical relation between \"P\" and \"Q\" is expressed as \"if \"P\", then \"Q\" and denoted \"P\" ⇒ \"Q\" (\"P\" implies \"Q\"). It may also be expressed as any of \"P\" only if \"Q\", \"Q\", if \"P\", \"Q\" whenever \"P\", and \"Q\" when \"P\"\". One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \"P\" is sufficient for \"Q\", then knowing \"P\" to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that \"Q\" is true; however, knowing \"P\" to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that \"Q\" is false.\n\nThe logical relation is, as before, expressed as \"if \"P\", then \"Q\" or \"P\" ⇒ \"Q\". This can also be expressed as \"P\" only if \"Q\", \"P\" implies \"Q\"\" or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition, as illustrated in example 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other. For instance, \"being a mammal\" (\"N\") is necessary but not sufficient to \"being human\" (\"S\"), and that a number formula_11 \"is rational\" (\"S\") is sufficient but not necessary to formula_11 \"being a real number\" (\"N\") (since there are real numbers that are not rational).\n\nA condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, \"today is the Fourth of July\" is a necessary and sufficient condition for \"today is Independence Day in the United States\". Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility of a matrix \"M\" is that \"M\" has a nonzero determinant.\n\nMathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are dual to one another. For any statements \"S\" and \"N\", the assertion that \"\"N\" is necessary for \"S\" is equivalent to the assertion that \"S\" is sufficient for \"N\"\". Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using \"and\") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using \"or\") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity. For a third facet, identify every mathematical predicate \"N\" with the set \"T\"(\"N\") of objects, events, or statements for which \"N\" holds true; then asserting the necessity of \"N\" for \"S\" is equivalent to claiming that \"T\"(\"N\") is a superset of \"T\"(\"S\"), while asserting the sufficiency of \"S\" for \"N\" is equivalent to claiming that \"T\"(\"S\") is a subset of \"T\"(\"N\").\n\nTo say that \"P\" is necessary and sufficient for \"Q\" is to say two things:\n\nOne may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement \"\"P\" if and only if \"Q\"\", which is denoted by formula_16, whereas cases tell us that formula_16 is identical to formula_15.\n\nFor example, in graph theory a graph \"G\" is called bipartite if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color \"black\" or \"white\" in such a way that every edge of \"G\" has one endpoint of each color. And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length cycles. Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely. A philosopher might characterize this state of affairs thus: \"Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in intension, they have identical extension.\n\nIn mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form \"\"P\" is true if and only if \"Q\" is true\". Their proofs normally first prove sufficiency, e.g. formula_14. Secondly, the opposite is proven, formula_20\n\nThis proves that the circles for Q and P match on the Venn diagrams above.\n\nBecause, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. formula_13 is equivalent to formula_20, if \"P\" is necessary and sufficient for \"Q\", then \"Q\" is necessary and sufficient for \"P\". We can write formula_23 and say that the statements \"\"P\" is true if and only if \"Q\", is true\" and \"\"Q\" is true if and only if \"P\" is true\" are equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The null model is used as a term of comparison, to verify whether the object in question displays some non-trivial features (properties that wouldn't be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints), such as community structure in graphs. An appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable null hypothesis for the behavior of the system under investigation.\n\nOne null model of utility in the study of complex networks is that proposed by Newman and Girvan, consisting of a randomized version of an original graph formula_1, produced through edges being rewired at random, under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph.\n\nThe null model is the basic concept behind the definition of modularity, a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters. In particular, given a graph formula_1 and a specific community partition formula_3 (an assignment of a community-index formula_4 (here taken as an integer from formula_5 to formula_6) to each vertex formula_7 in the graph), the modularity measures the difference between the number of links from/to each pair of communities, from that expected in a graph that is completely random in all respects other than the set of degrees of each of the vertices (the degree sequence). In other words, the modularity contrasts the exhibited community structure in formula_1 with that of a null model, which in this case is the configuration model (the maximally random graph subject to a constraint on the degree of each vertex).\n\n"}

SNAs were introduced as a topic of study by Grebogi et al. in 1984. SNAs can be distinguished from periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors using the 0-1 test for chaos.\n\nPeriodically driven damped nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamics characterized by strange chaotic attractors, where strange refers to the fractal geometry of the attractor and chaotic refers to the exponential sensitivity of orbits on the attractor. Quasiperiodically driven systems forced by incommensurate frequencies are natural extensions of periodically driven ones and are phenomenologically richer. In addition to periodic or quasiperiodic motion, they can exhibit chaotic or nonchaotic motion on strange attractors. Although quasiperiodic forcing is not necessary for strange nonchaotic dynamics (e.g., the period doubling accumulation point of a period doubling cascade), if quasiperiodic driving is not present, strange nonchaotic attractors are typically not robust and not expected to occur naturally because they exist only when the system is carefully tuned to a precise critical parameter value. On the other hand, it was shown in the paper of Grebogi et al. that SNA's can be robust when the system is quasiperiodically driven. The first experiment to demonstrate a robust strange nonchaotic attractor involved the buckling of a magnetoelastic ribbon driven quasiperiodically by two incommensurate frequencies in the golden ratio. Strange nonchaotic attractors have been robustly observed in laboratory experiments involving magnetoelastic ribbons, electrochemical cells, electronic circuits, a neon glow discharge and most recently detected in the dynamics of the pulsating RR Lyrae variables KIC 5520878 (as obtained from the Kepler Space Telescope) which may be the first strange nonchaotic dynamical system observed in the wild.\n"}

The argument purports to show a distance function approximating Pythagoras' theorem on a discrete space cannot be defined and, since the Pythagorean theorem has been confirmed to be approximately true in nature, physical space is not discrete. While academic debate continues, counterarguments have been proposed in the literature.\n\nA demonstration of Weyl's argument proceeds by constructing a rectangular tiling of the plane representing a discrete space. A discretized triangle, n units tall and n units long, can be constructed on the tiling. The hypotenuse of the resulting triangle will be n tiles long. However, by the pythagorean theorem, a corresponding triangle in a continuous space—a triangle whose height and length are n -- will have a hypotenuse measuring n√2 units long. To show that the former result does not converge to the latter for arbitrary values of n, one can examine the percent difference between the two results: = 1-. Since n cancels out, the two results never converge, even in the limit of large n. The argument can be constructed for more general triangles, but, in each case, the result is the same. Thus, a discrete space does not even approximate the pythagorean theorem.\n\nIn response, Kris McDaniel has argued the Weyl Tile argument depends on accepting the Size Thesis, according to which the distance between two points is given by the number of tiles between the two points. However, as McDaniel points out, the size thesis is not accepted for continuous spaces. Thus, we might have reason not to accept the size thesis for discrete spaces.\n\nNonetheless, if a discrete space is constructed by a rectangular tiling of the plane and the Size Thesis is accepted, the Euclidean metric will be inappropriate for measuring distances on the resulting space. Instead, the so-called Hamming metric should be utilized. Computer scientists interested in the distance between two strings and mathematical biologists interested in the distance between two genetic sequences employ the versions of the Hamming metric in each of their respective disciplines.\n"}
