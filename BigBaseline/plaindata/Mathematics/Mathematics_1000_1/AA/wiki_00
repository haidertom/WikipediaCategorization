{"id": "296942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296942", "title": "Double counting (proof technique)", "text": "Double counting (proof technique)\n\nIn combinatorics, double counting, also called counting in two ways, is a combinatorial proof technique for showing that two expressions are equal by demonstrating that they are two ways of counting the size of one set. In this technique, which call “one of the most important tools in combinatorics,” one describes a finite set \"X\" from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions for the size of the set. Since both expressions equal the size of the same set, they equal each other.\n\nThis is a simple example of double counting, often used when teaching multiplication to young children. In this context, multiplication is introduced as repeated addition, and is then shown to be commutative by counting, in two different ways, a number of items arranged in a rectangular grid. Suppose the grid has formula_1 rows and formula_2 columns. We first count the items by summing formula_1 rows of formula_2 items each, then a second time by summing formula_2 columns of formula_1 items each, thus showing that, for these particular values of formula_1 and formula_2, formula_9. While not a proof, it clearly shows that multiplication commutes, for any example (of a practical size) we choose.\n\nOne example of the double counting method counts the number of ways in which a committee can be formed from \"n\" people, allowing any number of the people (even zero of them) to be part of the committee. That is, one counts the number of subsets that an \"n\"-element set may have. One method for forming a committee is to ask each person to choose whether or not to join it. Each person has two choices – yes or no – and these choices are independent of those of the other people. Therefore there are 2 × 2 × ... × 2 = 2 possibilities. Alternatively, one may observe that the size of the committee must be some number between 0 and \"n\". For each possible size \"k\", the number of ways in which a committee of \"k\" people can be formed from \"n\" people is the binomial coefficient\nTherefore the total number of possible committees is the sum of binomial coefficients over \"k\" = 0, 1, 2, ... \"n\". Equating the two expressions gives the identity\na special case of the binomial theorem. A similar double counting method can be used to prove the more general identity\n\nAnother theorem that is commonly proven with a double counting argument states that every undirected graph contains an even number of vertices of odd degree. That is, the number of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges must be even. In more colloquial terms, in a party of people some of whom shake hands, an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people's hands; for this reason, the result is known as the handshaking lemma. \n\nTo prove this by double counting, let \"d(v)\" be the degree of vertex \"v\". The number of vertex-edge incidences in the graph may be counted in two different ways: by summing the degrees of the vertices, or by counting two incidences for every edge. Therefore\nwhere \"e\" is the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of the vertices is therefore an even number, which could not happen if an odd number of the vertices had odd degree. This fact, with this proof, appears in the 1736 paper of Leonhard Euler on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg that first began the study of graph theory.\n\nWhat is the number \"T\" of different trees that can be formed from a set of \"n\" distinct vertices? Cayley's formula gives the answer . list four proofs of this fact; they write of the fourth, a double counting proof due to Jim Pitman, that it is “the most beautiful of them all.”\n\nPitman's proof counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on \"n\" vertices to form from it a rooted tree. One way to form such a sequence is to start with one of the \"T\" possible unrooted trees, choose one of its \"n\" vertices as root, and choose one of the possible sequences in which to add its (directed) edges. Therefore, the total number of sequences that can be formed in this way is .\n\nAnother way to count these edge sequences is to consider adding the edges one by one to an empty graph, and to count the number of choices available at each step. If one has added a collection of edges already, so that the graph formed by these edges is a rooted forest with \"k\" trees, there are choices for the next edge to add: its starting vertex can be any one of the \"n\" vertices of the graph, and its ending vertex can be any one of the roots other than the root of the tree containing the starting vertex. Therefore, if one multiplies together the number of choices from the first step, the second step, etc., the total number of choices is\nEquating these two formulas for the number of edge sequences results in Cayley's formula:\nand\nAs Aigner and Ziegler describe, the formula and the proof can be generalized to count the number of rooted forests with \"k\" trees, for any \"k\".\n\n\n\n"}

Innumeracy is a problem with many otherwise educated and knowledgeable people. While many people would be ashamed to admit they are illiterate, there is very little shame in saying \"I'm a people person, not a numbers person.\" Or \"I always hated math\".\n\nPaulos speaks mainly of the common misconceptions in regard to numbers. He looks at real-world examples in stock scams, psychics, astrology, sports records, elections, sex discrimination, UFOs, insurance and law, lotteries and drug testing. Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more quantitative way. The book sheds light on the link between innumeracy and pseudoscience. For example, the fortune telling psychic's few correct and general observations are remembered over the many incorrect guesses. He also stresses the problem between the actual number of occurrences of various risks and popular perceptions of those risks happening. The problems of innumeracy come at a great cost to society. Topics include probability and coincidence, innumeracy in pseudoscience, statistics and trade-offs in society. For example, the danger of getting killed in a car accident is much greater than terrorism and this danger should be reflected in how we allocate our limited resources.\n\nJohn Allen Paulos (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of mathematics at Temple University in Pennsylvania. He is a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of mathematical literacy. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability and logic. He has received awards in:\n2013 JPBM (Joint Policy Board for Mathematics) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.\n2003 AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.\n\nAs a reasons for writing the book he states:\nInnumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe when words such as “imply” and “infer” are confused react without a trace of embarrassment to even the most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference between “continually” and “continuously.” Later that evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained the mistake to him, he wasn’t nearly as indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle.\n\n\"Innumeracy\" made the New York Times best seller the year it came out in 1988. It was on the New York Times best seller for 18 weeks. There was a slightly revised addition in 2001. It received favorable reviews in the New York Times \"He takes us a couple of steps closer to numeracy, and it is all in all an enlightening place to be.\" The Chicago Tribune wrote \"Despite the title, which suggests yet another learned report documenting the sorry state of America's educational system, what Paulos provides is a readable romp across a varied mathematical landscape.\nIt serves as an excellent antidote to tedious classroom lectures on the difference between inverse and direct proportions.\" The LA Times review noted \"\"Paulos is very good at explaining all of this, though sometimes with a hectoring, bitter tone, for which he apologizes at the very end.\" The Christian Science Monitor review said \"Should you read \"Innumeracy\" if you enjoy reading math problems and reasoning them out? Yes, it's fun. Should you read it if you think you hate math and are turned off by math problems? Yes, you may even get turned on.\"\n"}

While differentiation has easy rules by which the derivative of a complicated function can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions, integration does not, so tables of known integrals are often useful. This page lists some of the most common antiderivatives.\n\nA compilation of a list of integrals (Integraltafeln) and techniques of integral calculus was published by the German mathematician (aka ) in 1810. These tables were republished in the United Kingdom in 1823. More extensive tables were compiled in 1858 by the Dutch mathematician David Bierens de Haan for his \"Tables d'intégrales définies\", supplemented by \"Supplément aux tables d'intégrales définies\" in ca. 1864. A new edition was published in 1867 under the title \"Nouvelles tables d'intégrales définies\". These tables, which contain mainly integrals of elementary functions, remained in use until the middle of the 20th century. They were then replaced by the much more extensive tables of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. In Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, integrals originating from the book by Bierens de Haan are denoted by BI.\n\nNot all closed-form expressions have closed-form antiderivatives; this study forms the subject of differential Galois theory, which was initially developed by Joseph Liouville in the 1830s and 1840s, leading to Liouville's theorem which classifies which expressions have closed form antiderivatives. A simple example of a function without a closed form antiderivative is , whose antiderivative is (up to constants) the error function.\n\nSince 1968 there is the Risch algorithm for determining indefinite integrals that can be expressed in term of elementary functions, typically using a computer algebra system. Integrals that cannot be expressed using elementary functions can be manipulated symbolically using general functions such as the Meijer G-function.\n\nMore detail may be found on the following pages for the lists of integrals:\n\n\nGradshteyn, Ryzhik, Geronimus, Tseytlin, Jeffrey, Zwillinger, Moll's (GR) \"Table of Integrals, Series, and Products\" contains a large collection of results. An even larger, multivolume table is the \"Integrals and Series\" by Prudnikov, Brychkov, and Marichev (with volumes 1–3 listing integrals and series of elementary and special functions, volume 4–5 are tables of Laplace transforms). More compact collections can be found in e.g. Brychkov, Marichev, Prudnikov's \"Tables of Indefinite Integrals\", or as chapters in Zwillinger's \"CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae\" or Bronshtein and Semendyayev's \"Guide Book to Mathematics\", \"Handbook of Mathematics\" or \"Users' Guide to Mathematics\", and other mathematical handbooks.\n\nOther useful resources include Abramowitz and Stegun and the Bateman Manuscript Project. Both works contain many identities concerning specific integrals, which are organized with the most relevant topic instead of being collected into a separate table. Two volumes of the Bateman Manuscript are specific to integral transforms.\n\nThere are several web sites which have tables of integrals and integrals on demand. Wolfram Alpha can show results, and for some simpler expressions, also the intermediate steps of the integration. Wolfram Research also operates another online service, the Wolfram Mathematica Online Integrator.\n\n\"C\" is used for an arbitrary constant of integration that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus each function has an infinite number of antiderivatives.\n\nThese formulas only state in another form the assertions in the table of derivatives.\n\nWhen there is a singularity in the function being integrated such that the antiderivative becomes undefined or at some point (the singularity), then \"C\" does not need to be the same on both sides of the singularity. The forms below normally assume the Cauchy principal value around a singularity in the value of \"C\" but this is not in general necessary. For instance in\n\nthere is a singularity at 0 and the antiderivative becomes infinite there. If the integral above were to be used to compute a definite integral between −1 and 1, one would get the wrong answer 0. This however is the Cauchy principal value of the integral around the singularity. If the integration is done in the complex plane the result depends on the path around the origin, in this case the singularity contributes −\"i\" when using a path above the origin and \"i\" for a path below the origin. A function on the real line could use a completely different value of \"C\" on either side of the origin as in:\n\nThe following function has a non-integrable singularity at 0 for :\n\nLet be a function which has at most one root on each interval on which it is defined, and an antiderivative of that is zero at each root of (such an antiderivative exists if and only if the condition on is satisfied), then\nwhere is the sign function, which takes the values −1, 0, 1 when is respectively negative, zero or positive.

If we also use the fact that the absolute values of sine and cosine are periodic with period , then we get:\n\nCi, Si: Trigonometric integrals, Ei: Exponential integral, li: Logarithmic integral function, erf: Error function\n\nThere are some functions whose antiderivatives \"cannot\" be expressed in closed form. However, the values of the definite integrals of some of these functions over some common intervals can be calculated. A few useful integrals are given below.\n\nIf the function has bounded variation on the interval , then the method of exhaustion provides a formula for the integral:\n\nThe \"sophomore's dream\":\n\nattributed to Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He finished his studies in philosophy with a thesis on electricity (1747), then graduated in law (1751). For a while he became the governor of probably Charles Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg and Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold during their stay in Geneva and traveled with them to the University of Turin. He managed a boarding school for young English held by his father Charles Frederick, lawyer and professor of law at the Geneva Academy. He was appointed as the hofmeister of a Baron van Van Wassenaer and a Bentinck. \n\nIn 1752 he purchased 's physics laboratory and in 1757 acceded the chair of mathematics and the honorary chair of Experimental Physics of the Academy of Geneva. As a correspondent of the Académie royale des sciences he had written an article for the Encyclopedia on Friction in mechanics. \nIn 1759 he lost his wife Isabelle André, whom he had married in 1752 and came from Marseille. In 1761 he was forced to resign from his professorship after a scandal (Vernes-Necker case). \nIn 1762 with the help of his brother he was appointed in a trading house in Marseille and added to his last name de Germany, after the family estate near Rolle. He was dropped from the Académie des sciences's list of Corresponding Members in 1767.\n\nIn 1770 he moved to Paris. In 1772 he became a banker at . In 1773 he remarried. Between 1774 and 1778 he must have been very busy collecting interest for his rich and noble clients in Utrecht, the Netherlands. An astonishing number of notarial deeds are on his name. In 1776 he became resident for the Republic of Geneva, succeeding his brother. When Emmanuel Haller was appointed in the Girardot bank in 1777, Louis became a silent partner. At some time (1777?) he became a friend of Benjamin Franklin. Jacques Necker was dismissed on 19 May 1781 as controller of the royal treasury. It seems the brothers were still cooperating as Jacques and Louis received annually 8 million livres as a pension. \n\nAs a result of changes during the liberal phase of the French Revolution, he thought it prudent to return to his homeland in 1791. The disgrace of his younger brother Jacques, who resigned in 1790, contributed to his decision. The Neckers were far from welcome in Geneva. Many of the French émigrés considered them Jacobins, and many of the Swiss Jacobins thought them conservative.\n\nHis son Jacques (1757-1825), who had joined the French army, married Albertine Necker de Saussure in 1785. The French Revolution ended his military career. In 1790, he began teaching as a demonstrator in botany at the Academy of Geneva as Professor of Botany.\n\n\n"}

Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings, architects use geometry: to define the spatial form of a building; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, aesthetic and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as tessellations; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, India, and the Islamic world, buildings including pyramids, temples, mosques, palaces and mausoleums were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, geometric shapes and geometric tiling patterns are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a fractal-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in Hindu cosmology. In Chinese architecture, the tulou of Fujian province are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.\n\nIn Renaissance architecture, symmetry and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio, influenced by Vitruvius's \"De architectura\" from Ancient Rome and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Vladimir Shukhov in Russia and Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona pioneered the use of hyperboloid structures; in the Sagrada Família, Gaudí also incorporated hyperbolic paraboloids, tessellations, catenary arches, catenoids, helicoids, and ruled surfaces. In the twentieth century, styles such as modern architecture and Deconstructivism explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. Minimal surfaces have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at Denver International Airport, while Richard Buckminster Fuller pioneered the use of the strong thin-shell structures known as geodesic domes.\n\nThe architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between architecture and mathematics, note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure study of number and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since antiquity. In Ancient Rome, Vitruvius described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily geometry, to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the Middle Ages, where graduates learnt arithmetic, geometry and aesthetics alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the trivium) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the Renaissance, the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the Renaissance man such as Leon Battista Alberti. Similarly in England, Sir Christopher Wren, known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.\n\nWilliams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist Theodor Adorno, identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be revolutionary, introducing wholly new ideas; reactionary, failing to introduce change; or revivalist, actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the Gothic Revival in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian Mannerism of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century Baroque and Palladian movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as Futurism and Constructivism actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to Modernist architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, fractal geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was aperiodic tiling, to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.\n\nArchitects use mathematics for several reasons, leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the engineering of buildings. Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building. Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are considered beautiful or harmonious. From the time of the Pythagoreans with their religious philosophy of number, architects in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, the Islamic world and the Italian Renaissance have chosen the proportions of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles. Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as tessellations to decorate buildings. Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings.\n\nThe influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and \"symmetria\". Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. \"Symmetria\" in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than mirror symmetry, as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at Fano, he uses ratios of small integers, especially the triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, ...) to proportion the structure into (Vitruvian) modules. Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.\n\nVitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his \"De architectura\", c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or \"Commodity\" in Henry Wotton's 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.\n\nThe Pantheon in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular oculus to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, , so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter. These dimensions make more sense when expressed in ancient Roman units of measurement: The dome spans 150 Roman feet); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high. The Pantheon remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.\n\nThe first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 \"De re aedificatoria\" (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's \"De architectura\" and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:. Alberti also documented Filippo Brunelleschi's discovery of linear perspective, developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.\n\nThe next major text was Sebastiano Serlio's \"Regole generali d'architettura\" (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and perspective. Two of Serlio's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.\nIn 1570, Andrea Palladio published the influential \"I quattro libri dell'architettura\" (The Four Books of Architecture) in Venice. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 \"The Elements of Architecture\". The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa. Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the \"Quattro libri\", stating:\n\nIn 1615, Vincenzo Scamozzi published the late Renaissance treatise \"L'Idea dell'Architettura Universale\" (The Idea of a Universal Architecture). He attempted to relate the design of cities and buildings to the ideas of Vitruvius and the Pythagoreans, and to the more recent ideas of Palladio.\n\nHyperboloid structures were used starting towards the end of the nineteenth century by Vladimir Shukhov for masts, lighthouses and cooling towers. Their striking shape is both aesthetically interesting and strong, using structural materials economically. Shukhov's first hyperboloidal tower was exhibited in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896.\n\nThe early twentieth century movement Modern Architecture, pioneered by Russian Constructivism, used rectilinear Euclidean (also called Cartesian) geometry. In the De Stijl movement, the horizontal and the vertical were seen as constituting the universal. The architectural form consists of putting these two directional tendencies together, using roof planes, wall planes and balconies, which either slide past or intersect each other, as in the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House by Gerrit Rietveld.\nModernist architects were free to make use of curves as well as planes. Charles Holden's 1933 Arnos station has a circular ticket hall in brick with a flat concrete roof. In 1938, the Bauhaus painter Laszlo Moholy-Nagy adopted Raoul Heinrich Francé's seven biotechnical elements, namely the crystal, the sphere, the cone, the plane, the (cuboidal) strip, the (cylindrical) rod, and the spiral, as the supposed basic building blocks of architecture inspired by nature.\n\nLe Corbusier proposed an anthropometric scale of proportions in architecture, the Modulor, based on the supposed height of a man. Le Corbusier's 1955 Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut uses free-form curves not describable in mathematical formulae. The shapes are said to be evocative of natural forms such as the prow of a ship or praying hands. The design is only at the largest scale: there is no hierarchy of detail at smaller scales, and thus no fractal dimension; the same applies to other famous twentieth-century buildings such as the Sydney Opera House, Denver International Airport, and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao.\n\nContemporary architecture, in the opinion of the 90 leading architects who responded to a 2010 World Architecture Survey, is extremely diverse; the best was judged to be Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao.\n\nDenver International Airport's terminal building, completed in 1995, has a fabric roof supported as a minimal surface (i.e., its mean curvature is zero) by steel cables. It evokes Colorado's snow-capped mountains and the teepee tents of Native Americans.\n\nThe architect Richard Buckminster Fuller is famous for designing strong thin-shell structures known as geodesic domes. The Montréal Biosphère dome is high; its diameter is .\n\nSydney Opera House has a dramatic roof consisting of soaring white vaults, reminiscent of ship's sails; to make them possible to construct using standardized components, the vaults are all composed of triangular sections of spherical shells with the same radius. These have the required uniform curvature in every direction.\n\nThe late twentieth century movement \"Deconstructivism\" creates deliberate disorder with what Nikos Salingaros in \"A Theory of Architecture\" calls random forms of high complexity by using non-parallel walls, superimposed grids and complex 2-D surfaces, as in Frank Gehry's Disney Concert Hall and Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao. Until the twentieth century, architecture students were obliged to have a grounding in mathematics. Salingaros argues that first \"overly simplistic, politically-driven\" Modernism and then \"anti-scientific\" Deconstructivism have effectively separated architecture from mathematics. He believes that this \"reversal of mathematical values\" is harmful, as the \"pervasive aesthetic\" of non-mathematical architecture trains people \"to reject mathematical information in the built environment\"; he argues that this has negative effects on society.\n\nThe pyramids of Ancient Egypt are tombs constructed with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated. The face angle is about 51°85’, and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1.619, less than 1% from the golden ratio. If this was the design method, it would imply the use of Kepler's triangle (face angle 51°49’). However it is more likely that the pyramids' slope was chosen from the 3-4-5 triangle (face angle 53°8’), known from the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 1650 – 1550 BC); or from the triangle with base to hypotenuse ratio 1:4/π (face angle 51°50’).\n\nThe possible use of the 3-4-5 triangle to lay out right angles, such as for the ground plan of a pyramid, and the knowledge of Pythagoras theorem which that would imply, has been much asserted. It was first conjectured by the historian Moritz Cantor in 1882. It is known that right angles were laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt; that their surveyors did use knotted cords for measurement; that Plutarch recorded in \"Isis and Osiris\" (around 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3-4-5 triangle; and that the Berlin Papyrus 6619 from the Middle Kingdom (before 1700 BC) stated that \"the area of a square of 100 is equal to that of two smaller squares. The side of one is ½ + ¼ the side of the other.\" The historian of mathematics Roger L. Cooke observes that \"It is hard to imagine anyone being interested in such conditions without knowing the Pythagorean theorem.\" Against this, Cooke notes that no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle's sides, and that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. Cooke concludes that Cantor's conjecture remains uncertain: he guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but that \"there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles\".\n\nVaastu Shastra, the ancient Indian canons of architecture and town planning, employs symmetrical drawings called mandalas. Complex calculations are used to arrive at the dimensions of a building and its components. The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns (yantra), symmetry and directional alignments. However, early builders may have come upon mathematical proportions by accident. The mathematician Georges Ifrah notes that simple \"tricks\" with string and stakes can be used to lay out geometric shapes, such as ellipses and right angles.\n\nThe mathematics of fractals has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall gopuram gatehouses of Hindu temples such as the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi built in the seventh century, and others such as the Kandariya Mahadev Temple at Khajuraho, the parts and the whole have the same character, with fractal dimension in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (\"shikhara\", lit. 'mountain') about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy Mount Kailash, abode of Lord Shiva, depicts the endless repetition of universes in Hindu cosmology. The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers, themselves grouped among still smaller towers, that:\n\nThe Meenakshi Amman Temple is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of Madurai laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras. The four gateways are tall towers (gopurams) with fractal-like repetitive structure as at Hampi. The enclosures around each shrine are rectangular and surrounded by high stone walls.\n\nPythagoras (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that \"all things are numbers\". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word \"symmetria\" originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.\nThe Parthenon is long, wide and high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight of the Pythagoreans 4:6:9. This sets the module as 0.858 m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ( wide by 48.3 m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, , and the spacing of their centres, , is also 4:9.\n\nThe Parthenon is considered by authors such as John Julius Norwich \"the most perfect Doric temple ever built\". Its elaborate architectural refinements include \"a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls and the \"entasis\" of the columns\". \"Entasis\" refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples, the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above: \"all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\".\n\nThe golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when Euclid described the method of geometric construction. It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases. More recent authors such as Nikos Salingaros, however, doubt all these claims. Experiments by the computer scientist George Markowsky failed to find any preference for the golden rectangle.\n\nThe historian of Islamic art Antonio Fernandez-Puertas suggests that the Alhambra, like the Great Mosque of Cordoba, was designed using the Hispano-Muslim foot or \"codo\" of about . In the palace's Court of the Lions, the proportions follow a series of surds. A rectangle with sides 1 and has (by Pythagoras's theorem) a diagonal of , which describes the right triangle made by the sides of the court; the series continues with (giving a 1:2 ratio), and so on. The decorative patterns are similarly proportioned, generating squares inside circles and eight-pointed stars, generating six-pointed stars. There is no evidence to support earlier claims that the golden ratio was used in the Alhambra. The Court of the Lions is bracketed by the Hall of Two Sisters and the Hall of the Abencerrajes; a regular hexagon can be drawn from the centres of these two halls and the four inside corners of the Court of the Lions.\n\nThe Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, Turkey, was built by Mimar Sinan to provide a space where the mihrab could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of diameter and high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, tall. The building's plan is thus a circle inside an octagon inside a square.\n\nMughal architecture, as seen in the abandoned imperial city of Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal complex, has a distinctive mathematical order and a strong aesthetic based on symmetry and harmony.\n\nThe Taj Mahal exemplifies Mughal architecture, both representing paradise and displaying the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's power through its scale, symmetry and costly decoration. The white marble mausoleum, decorated with pietra dura, the great gate (\"Darwaza-i rauza\"), other buildings, the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design. The buildings include a mosque in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal charbagh ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum. These are divided in turn into 16 parterres.\n\nThe Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid, subdivided into smaller grids. The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or gaz, the main area being three 374-gaz squares. These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17-gaz modules; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz, and are 368 gaz wide (16 x 23). The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units, which may help to explain the choice of ratios in the complex.\n\nThe Christian patriarchal basilica of Haghia Sophia in Byzantium (now Istanbul), first constructed in 537 (and twice rebuilt), was for a thousand years the largest cathedral ever built. It inspired many later buildings including Sultan Ahmed and other mosques in the city. The Byzantine architecture includes a nave crowned by a circular dome and two half-domes, all of the same diameter (), with a further five smaller half-domes forming an apse and four rounded corners of a vast rectangular interior. This was interpreted by mediaeval architects as representing the mundane below (the square base) and the divine heavens above (the soaring spherical dome). The emperor Justinian used two geometers, Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles as architects; Isidore compiled the works of Archimedes on solid geometry, and was influenced by him.\n\nThe importance of water baptism in Christianity was reflected in the scale of baptistry architecture. The oldest, the Lateran Baptistry in Rome, built in 440, set a trend for octagonal baptistries; the baptismal font inside these buildings was often octagonal, though Italy's largest baptistry, at Pisa, built between 1152 and 1363, is circular, with an octagonal font. It is high, with a diameter of (a ratio of 8:5). Saint Ambrose wrote that fonts and baptistries were octagonal \"because on the eighth day, by rising, Christ loosens the bondage of death and receives the dead from their graves.\"\nSaint Augustine similarly described the eighth day as \"everlasting ... hallowed by the resurrection of Christ\". The octagonal Baptistry of Saint John, Florence, built between 1059 and 1128, is one of the oldest buildings in that city, and one of the last in the direct tradition of classical antiquity; it was extremely influential in the subsequent Florentine Renaissance, as major architects including Francesco Talenti, Alberti and Brunelleschi used it as the model of classical architecture.\n\nThe number five is used \"exuberantly\" in the 1721 Pilgrimage Church of St John of Nepomuk at Zelená hora, near Žďár nad Sázavou in the Czech republic, designed by Jan Blažej Santini Aichel. The nave is circular, surrounded by five pairs of columns and five oval domes alternating with ogival apses. The church further has five gates, five chapels, five altars and five stars; a legend claims that when Saint John of Nepomuk was martyred, five stars appeared over his head. The fivefold architecture may also symbolise the five wounds of Christ and the five letters of \"Tacui\" (Latin: \"I kept silence\" [about secrets of the confessional]).\n\nAntoni Gaudí used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the Sagrada Família, Barcelona, started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2015). These include hyperbolic paraboloids and hyperboloids of revolution, tessellations, catenary arches, catenoids, helicoids, and ruled surfaces. This varied mix of geometries is creatively combined in different ways around the church. For example, in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família, Gaudí assembled stone \"branches\" in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, which overlap at their tops (directrices) without, therefore, meeting at a point. In contrast, in the colonnade there are hyperbolic paraboloidal surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces. Further, Gaudí exploits natural patterns, themselves mathematical, with columns derived from the shapes of trees, and lintels made from unmodified basalt naturally cracked (by cooling from molten rock) into hexagonal columns.\n\nThe 1971 Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, San Francisco has a saddle roof composed of eight segments of hyperbolic paraboloids, arranged so that the bottom horizontal cross section of the roof is a square and the top cross section is a Christian cross. The building is a square on a side, and high. The 1970 Cathedral of Brasília by Oscar Niemeyer makes a different use of a hyperboloid structure; it is constructed from 16 identical concrete beams, each weighing 90 tonnes, arranged in a circle to form a hyperboloid of revolution, the white beams creating a shape like hands praying to heaven. Only the dome is visible from outside: most of the building is below ground.\n\nSeveral medieval churches in Scandinavia are circular, including four on the Danish island of Bornholm. One of the oldest of these, Østerlars Church from c. 1160, has a circular nave around a massive circular stone column, pierced with arches and decorated with a fresco. The circular structure has three storeys and was apparently fortified, the top storey having served for defence.\n\nIslamic buildings are often decorated with geometric patterns which typically make use of several mathematical tessellations, formed of ceramic tiles (girih, zellige) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes. Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the 'Khatem Sulemani' or Solomon's seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre. Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible wallpaper groups; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 Branko Grünbaum claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings. In 1913, the Modernist architect Adolf Loos had declared that \"Ornament is a crime\", influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of ornament. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen's 2011 Harpa Concert and Conference Centre, Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass. Foreign Office Architects' 2010 Ravensbourne College, London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes. The tessellation uses three types of tile, an equilateral triangle and two irregular pentagons. Kazumi Kudo's Kanazawa Umimirai Library creates a decorative grid made of small circular blocks of glass set into plain concrete walls.\n\nThe architecture of fortifications evolved from medieval fortresses, which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical star forts able to resist artillery bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include Michelangelo, Baldassare Peruzzi, Vincenzo Scamozzi and Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.\n\nThe architectural historian Siegfried Giedion argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance ideal city: \"The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city.\"\n\nIn Chinese architecture, the tulou of Fujian province are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.\n\nArchitects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals. For example, Foster and Partners' 30 St Mary Axe, London, known as \"The Gherkin\" for its cucumber-like shape, is a solid of revolution designed using parametric modelling. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are quadrilaterals, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.\n\nThe traditional yakhchal (ice pit) of Persia functioned as an evaporative cooler. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with windcatchers. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert faloodeh.\n\n\n"}

A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including topology, graph theory, number theory and algebra. Some techniques such as counted-thread embroidery are naturally geometrical; other kinds of textile provide a ready means for the colorful physical expression of mathematical concepts.\n\nThe IEEE Spectrum has organized a number of competitions on quilt block design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject \"Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required\". Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the golden rectangle, conic sections, Leonardo da Vinci's Claw, the Koch curve, the Clifford torus, San Gaku, Mascheroni's cardioid, Pythagorean triples, spidrons, and the six trigonometric functions.\n\nKnitted mathematical objects include the Platonic solids, Klein bottles and Boy's surface.\nThe Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using crochet. Knitted and crocheted tori have also been constructed depicting toroidal embeddings of the complete graph \"K\" and of the Heawood graph. The crocheting of hyperbolic planes has been popularized by the Institute For Figuring; a book by Daina Taimina on the subject, \"Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes\", won the 2009 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.\n\nEmbroidery techniques such as counted-thread embroidery including cross-stitch and some canvas work methods such as Bargello (needlework) make use of the natural pixels of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.\n\nAda Dietz (1882 – 1950) was an American weaver best known for her 1949 monograph \"Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles\", which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate polynomials.\n\nMargaret Greig was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of worsted spinning.\n\nThe silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection are all based on Douglas McKenna's space-filling curve patterns. The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique.\n\nThe Issey Miyake Fall-Winter 2010–2011 ready-to-wear collection featured designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician William Thurston. The designs were inspired by Thurston's geometrization conjecture, the statement that every 3-manifold can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by Grigori Perelman as part of his proof of the Poincaré conjecture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "432897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=432897", "title": "Mechanical calculator", "text": "Mechanical calculator\n\nA mechanical calculator, or calculating machine, is a mechanical device used to perform automatically the basic operations of arithmetic. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator.\n\nSurviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of Napier's bones, to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions. A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial, and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999). Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.\n\nTwo decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, Blaise Pascal decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator. Co-opted into his father's labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required; it was called Pascal's Calculator or Pascaline.\n\nThomas' arithmometer, the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale.\n\nThe comptometer, introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard which consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured from 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita mk7 from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.\n\nCharles Babbage designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a steam engine to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime. The first one was an \"automatic\" mechanical calculator, his difference engine, which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, Georg Scheutz became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine. The second one was a \"programmable\" mechanical calculator, his analytical engine, which Babbage started to design in 1834; \"in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\" making it infinitely programmable. In 1937, Howard Aiken convinced IBM to design and build the ASCC/Mark I, the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine; when the machine was finished some hailed it as \"Babbage's dream come true\".\n\nA short list of other precursors to the mechanical calculator must include a group of mechanical analog computers which, once set, are only modified by the continuous and repeated action of their actuators (crank handle, weight, wheel, water...). Before common era, there are odometers and the Antikythera mechanism, an out of place, unique, geared astronomical clock, followed more than a millennium later by early mechanical clocks, geared astrolabes and followed in the 15th century by pedometers. These machines were all made of toothed gears linked by some sort of carry mechanisms. These machines always produce identical results for identical initial settings unlike a mechanical calculator where all the wheels are independent but are also linked together by the rules of arithmetic.\n\nThe 17th century marked the beginning of the history of mechanical calculators, as it saw the invention of its first machines, including Pascal's calculator, in 1642. Blaise Pascal had invented a machine which he presented as being able to perform computations that were previously thought to be only humanly possible, but he wasn't successful in creating an industry.\n\nThe 17th century also saw the invention of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like Napier's bones, logarithmic tables and the slide rule which, for their ease of use by scientists in multiplying and dividing, ruled over and impeded the use and development of mechanical calculators until the production release of the arithmometer in the mid 19th century.\nBlaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator with a sophisticated carry mechanism in 1642. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes he introduced his calculator to the public. He built twenty of these machines in the following ten years. This machine could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Since, unlike Schickard's machine, the Pascaline dials could only rotate in one direction zeroing it after each calculation required the operator to dial in all 9s and then (method of) propagate a carry right through the machine. This suggests that the carry mechanism would have proved itself in practice many times over. This is a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 17th and 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet it was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.\n\nIn 1672, Gottfried Leibniz started working on adding direct multiplication to what he understood was the working of Pascal's calculator. However, it is doubtful that he had ever fully seen the mechanism and the method could not have worked because of the lack of reversible rotation in the mechanism. Accordingly, he eventually designed an entirely new machine called the Stepped Reckoner; it used his Leibniz wheels, was the first two-motion calculator, the first to use cursors (creating a memory of the first operand) and the first to have a movable carriage. Leibniz built two Stepped Reckoners, one in 1694 and one in 1706. Only the machine built in 1694 is known to exist, it was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century having been forgotten in an attic in the University of Göttingen.\n\nLeibniz had invented his namesake wheel and the principle of a two motion calculator, but after forty years of development he wasn't able to produce a machine that was fully operational; this makes Pascal's calculator the only working mechanical calculator in the 17th century. Leibniz was also the first person to describe a pinwheel calculator. He once said \"It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.\"\n\nSchickard, Pascal and Leibniz were inevitably inspired by the role of clockwork which was highly celebrated in the seventeenth century. However, simple minded application of interlinked gears was insufficient for any of their purposes. Schickard introduced the use of a single toothed \"mutilated gear\" to enable the carry to take place. Pascal improved on that with his famous weighted sautoir. Leibniz went even further in relation to the ability to use a moveable carriage to perform multiplication more efficiently, albeit at the expense of a fully working carry mechanism.\n\nThe principle of the clock (input wheels and display wheels added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct entry calculating machine couldn't be implemented to create a fully effective calculating machine without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century. because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day do not have a machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian Giovanni Poleni in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).\n\n\nThe 18th century saw the first mechanical calculator that could perform a multiplication automatically; designed and built by Giovanni Poleni in 1709 and made of wood, it was the first successful calculating clock. For all the machines built in this century, division still required the operator to decide when to stop a repeated subtraction at each index, and therefore these machines were only providing a help in dividing, like an abacus. Both pinwheel calculators and Leibniz wheel calculators were built with a few unsuccessful attempts at their commercialization.\n\n\nLuigi Torchi invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834. This was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White (1822).\n\nThe mechanical calculator industry started in 1851 Thomas de Colmar released his simplified Arithmomètre which was the first machine that could be used daily in an office environment.\n\nFor 40 years, the arithmometer was the only mechanical calculator available for sale and was sold all over the world. By then, in 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold plus a few hundreds more from two licensed arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883). Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 comptometers in three years.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his difference engine, started in 1822, which was the first automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his analytical engine, which was the first programmable calculator, using Jacquard's cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the mainframe computers built in the middle of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\nThe cash register, invented by the American saloonkeeper James Ritty in 1879, addressed the old problems of disorganization and dishonesty in business transactions. It was a pure adding machine coupled with a printer, a bell and a two-sided display that showed the paying party and the store owner, if he wanted to, the amount of money exchanged for the current transaction.\n\nThe cash register was easy to use and, unlike genuine mechanical calculators, was needed and quickly adopted by a great number of businesses. \"Eighty four companies sold cash registers between 1888 and 1895, only three survived for any length of time\".\n\nIn 1890, 6 years after John Patterson started NCR Corporation, 20,000 machines had been sold by his company alone against a total of roughly 3,500 for all genuine calculators combined.\n\nBy 1900, NCR had built 200,000 cash registers and there were more companies manufacturing them, compared to the \"Thomas/Payen\" arithmometer company that had just sold around 3,300 and Burroughs had only sold 1,400 machines.\n\n\nTwo different classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations took place on the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.\n\nThe latter, type, rotary, had at least one main shaft that made one [or more] continuous revolution[s], one addition or subtraction per turn. Numerous designs, notably European calculators, had handcranks, and locks to ensure that the cranks were returned to exact positions once a turn was complete.\nThe first half of the 20th century saw the gradual development of the mechanical calculator mechanism.\n\nThe Dalton adding-listing machine introduced in 1902 was the first of its type to use only ten keys, and became the first of many different models of \"10-key add-listers\" manufactured by many companies.\n\nIn 1948 the cylindrical Curta calculator, which was compact enough to be held in one hand, was introduced after being developed by Curt Herzstark in 1938. This was an extreme development of the stepped-gear calculating mechanism. It subtracted by adding complements; between the teeth for addition were teeth for subtraction.\n\nFrom the early 1900s through the 1960s, mechanical calculators dominated the desktop computing market. Major suppliers in the USA included Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were \"full\" — each digit that could be entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.) One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, as well as some rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as Olivetti, did make printing calculators.\n\nIn these machines, addition and subtraction were performed in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but multiplication and division were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. Friden made a calculator that also provided square roots, basically by doing division, but with added mechanism that automatically incremented the number in the keyboard in a systematic fashion. The last of the mechanical calculators were likely to have short-cut multiplication, and some ten-key, serial-entry types had decimal-point keys. However, decimal-point keys required significant internal added complexity, and were offered only in the last designs to be made. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the 1948 Curta continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.\n\nTypical European four-operation machines use the Odhner mechanism, or variations of it. This kind of machine included the \"Original Odhner\", Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although most of these were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.\n\nAlthough Dalton introduced in 1902 first ten-key printing \"adding\" (two operations, the other being subtraction) machine, these feature were not present in \"computing\" (four operations) machines for many decades. Facit-T (1932) was the first 10-key computing machine sold in large numbers. Olivetti Divisumma-14 (1948) was the first computing machine with both printer and a 10-key keyboard.\n\nFull-keyboard machines, including motor-driven ones, were also built until the 1960s. Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most of which were adding machines, many with integral printers) were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set. Felt & Tarrant made Comptometers, as well as Victor, which were key-driven.\n\nThe basic mechanism of the Friden and Monroe was a modified Leibniz wheel (better known, perhaps informally, in the USA as a \"stepped drum\" or \"stepped reckoner\"). The Friden had an elementary reversing drive between the body of the machine and the accumulator dials, so its main shaft always rotated in the same direction. The Swiss MADAS was similar. The Monroe, however, reversed direction of its main shaft to subtract.\n\nThe earliest Marchants were pinwheel machines, but most of them were remarkably-sophisticated rotary types. They ran at 1,300 addition cycles per minute if the [+] bar is held down. Others were limited to 600 cycles per minute, because their accumulator dials started and stopped for every cycle; Marchant dials moved at a steady and proportional speed for continuing cycles. Most Marchants had a row of nine keys on the extreme right, as shown in the photo of the Figurematic. These simply made the machine add for the number of cycles corresponding to the number on the key, and then shifted the carriage one place. Even nine add cycles took only a short time.\n\nIn a Marchant, near the beginning of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward \"into the dip\", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears in the body of the machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!)\n\nIn any mechanical calculator, in effect, a gear, sector, or some similar device moves the accumulator by the number of gear teeth that corresponds to the digit being added or subtracted – three teeth changes the position by a count of three. The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).\n\nHowever, two different basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds corresponding to the digit being added or subtracted; a [1] moves the accumulator the slowest, and a [9], the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks (\"straight gears\") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for [1] is closest to the pivot, of course.\nFor each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much like that in the Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.\n\nThe Marchant, however, has, for every one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio \"preselector transmission\" with its output spur gear at the top of the machine's body; that gear engages the accumulator gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the gas pump. Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.\n\nGiven that nine ratios per column implies significant complexity, a Marchant contains a few hundred individual gears in all, many in its accumulator. Basically, the accumulator dial has to rotate 36 degrees (1/10 of a turn) for a [1], and 324 degrees (9/10 of a turn) for a [9], not allowing for incoming carries. At some point in the gearing, one tooth needs to pass for a [1], and nine teeth for a [9]. There is no way to develop the needed movement from a driveshaft that rotates one revolution per cycle with few gears having practical (relatively small) numbers of teeth.\n\nThe Marchant, therefore, has three driveshafts to feed the little transmissions. For one cycle, they rotate 1/2, 1/4, and 1/12 of a revolution. . The 1/2-turn shaft carries (for each column) gears with 12, 14, 16, and 18 teeth, corresponding to digits 6, 7, 8, and 9. The 1/4-turn shaft carries (also, each column) gears with 12, 16, and 20 teeth, for 3, 4, and 5. Digits [1] and [2] are handled by 12 and 24-tooth gears on the 1/12-revolution shaft. Practical design places the 12th-rev. shaft more distant, so the 1/4-turn shaft carries freely-rotating 24 and 12-tooth idler gears. For subtraction, the driveshafts reversed direction.\n\nIn the early part of the cycle, one of five pendants moves off-center to engage the appropriate drive gear for the selected digit.\n\nSome machines had as many as 20 columns in their full keyboards. The monster in this field was the \"Duodecillion\" made by Burroughs for exhibit purposes.\n\nFor sterling currency, £/s/d (and even farthings), there were variations of the basic mechanisms, in particular with different numbers of gear teeth and accumulator dial positions. To accommodate shillings and pence, extra columns were added for the tens digit[s], 10 and 20 for shillings, and 10 for pence. Of course, these functioned as radix-20 and radix-12 mechanisms.\n\nA variant of the Marchant, called the Binary-Octal Marchant, was a radix-8 (octal) machine. It was sold to check very early vacuum-tube (valve) binary computers for accuracy. (Back then, the mechanical calculator was much more reliable than a tube/valve computer.)\n\nAs well, there was a twin Marchant, comprising two pinwheel Marchants with a common drive crank and reversing gearbox. Twin machines were relatively rare, and apparently were used for surveying calculations. At least one triple machine was made.\n\nThe Facit calculator, and one similar to it, are basically pinwheel machines, but the array of pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of sliding pins to extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector as well as the same pins for 6 through 9.\n\nThe keys operate cams that operate a swinging lever to first unlock the pin-positioning cam that is part of the pinwheel mechanism; further movement of the lever (by an amount determined by the key's cam) rotates the pin-positioning cam to extend the necessary number of pins.\n\nStylus-operated adders with circular slots for the stylus, and side-by -side wheels, as made by Sterling Plastics (USA), had an ingenious anti-overshoot mechanism to ensure accurate carries.\nMechanical calculators continued to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, with many of the manufacturers closing down or being taken over. Comptometer type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and skilled operator could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a Comptometer quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator put an end to the Comptometer. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the slide rule had become obsolete.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1348989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1348989", "title": "Numbers (TV series)", "text": "Numbers (TV series)\n\nNumbers (stylized as NUMB3RS) is an American crime drama television series that ran on CBS from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, and follows FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his brother Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers Ridley and Tony Scott produced \"Numbers\"; its production companies are the Scott brothers' Scott Free Productions and CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television, and later CBS Paramount Network Television).\n\nThe show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and mathematically modeled by Charlie, with the help of Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, CBS announced that \"Numbers\" had been canceled after six seasons.\n\nThe show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the FBI, scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.\n\n\nTemporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode \"In Plain Sight\" (season 2, episode 8), one of the criminals is named Rolle and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named Robert Peterson.\n\nOpening: (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.\n\nThe first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' FBI field office and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and Terry Lake, as well as David Sinclair. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student Amita Ramanujan provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. Sabrina Lloyd played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by Diane Farr, who played Megan Reeves.\n\nThe second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to Washington and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: Megan Reeves and Colby Granger. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a nomadic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at Harvard University, but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.\n\n\"Numb3rs\" was renewed for a third season, which began airing at 10:00 p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his leave of absence—he will be on the International Space Station for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his ethics and self-worth, and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.\n\nNoticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show \"24\", but returned to \"Numbers\" for the 21st episode of season 3 (\"The Art of Reckoning\"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a Payload Specialist on the International Space Station. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for maternity leave in episode 18 (\"Democracy\"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Because of the writer's strike, only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes. The season ended on May 16, 2008.\n\nAs this season starts, Colby Granger escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a triple agent. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season 2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends FBI training camp because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to Washington, D.C., and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in Pakistan. He is subsequently arrested and has his security clearance revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.\n\nSeveral characters from previous seasons did not appear in season 4, most notably Mildred Finch and Ian Edgerton.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the 2008 presidential debates.\n\nSeason five opens three weeks after \"When Worlds Collide\" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his security clearance back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore Judaism. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, \"Spree\" and \"Two Daughters\") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. DARPA tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.\n\nNotes about Season Five:\n\"Disturbed\" marked the 100th episode of \"Numbers\".\n\nThe sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00 p.m. EDT and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.\n\nThe season starts with the engagement of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at CERN, in Geneva, and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his 401(k). After some delay, Larry leaves Los Angeles, only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the Big Brother/Big Sister program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to England to teach at the University of Cambridge. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some vigilante murders, and gets engaged to Robin. He also decides to leave the team, taking an administrative position within the FBI. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a guest house so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for Washington, D.C., to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.\n\nCBS DVD (Distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all six seasons of \"Numb3rs\" on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4.\n\nOn June 2, 2017, CBS DVD released \"Numb3rs: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nNicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science in 2006, and the National Science Board's Public Service Award in 2007. Also, the show's stunt coordinator, Jim Vickers, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination in 2006 for episode 14 of Season 2, \"Harvest\".\n\nSeveral mathematicians work as consultants for each episode. Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.\n\nA book entitled \"The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics\" (; published August 28, 2007), written by Keith Devlin and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.\n\nSince the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.\n\nWolfram Research (the developers of \"Mathematica\") is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled \"The math behind \"NUMB3RS\"\".\n\nOne part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding jargon, rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development. The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between Charlie Eppes and his graduate student Amita Ramanujan.\n\nThe idea for \"Numbers\" was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by Bill Nye, a popular science educator. The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the Sherlock Holmes character, and to the \"Mathnet\" segment on the children's television show \"Square One\".\n\nGabriel Macht was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes. Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of Southern California. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of , including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at Los Angeles Center Studios.\n\nAnother common location is the Craftsman home of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper, although a replica set was used from the second season onwards.\n\nThe show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter \"e\". In interviews with Tom Jicha of the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" and with Alan Pergament of \"The Buffalo News\", Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from leet, a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers. Dr. Gary Lorden, a California Institute of Technology mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told NPR's Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard. Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.\n\nBoth entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling. Some reporters, such as Joanne Ostrow of the \"Denver Post\", the staff members of \"People Magazine\", the editors of The Futon Critic, the staff of the Scripps Howard News Service, and Mike Hughes of \"USA Today\" acknowledged the presence of the number three in the title. Lynette Rice of \"Entertainment Weekly\" asked Krumholtz about the three in the title; his response was, \"Isn't that annoying? I think it should be the mathematical symbol for sigma, which looks like an E. I've been fighting that for weeks.\" (The sigma (∑) stands for summation.) Others used varying adjectives to describe the title. The TV site Zap2it.com called it \"their typographical silliness, not ours\". Brad Aspey of \"The Muskegon Chronicle\", stated, \"No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment.\" Ellen Gray of \"The Philadelphia Daily News\", said, \"Some of you may have noticed that in promoting \"Numb3rs,\" which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the \"e\" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed \"R\" in Toys R Us. So there.\"\n\nStill others had a more positive view of the title. When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer Tony Scott originated the title. Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was \"kind of hokey\" but later saw it as \"brilliant\" and a \"catchy logo\". Jonathan Storm of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", in his review of the series stated, \"You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves. But the \"3\" substituting for the \"e\" is actually based on a real thing\"…. He later said that the show was \"written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult\". David Brooks of \"The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)\" devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title. In addition, three psychologists, Manuel Perea, Jon Andoni Duñabeitia, and Manuel Carreiras mentioned the television series in their 2008 article for the American Psychological Association's \"\".\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"Numb3rs\" on CBS.\n\n\"Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\"\n\n"}

In that case, the function may be denoted formula_3 to indicate the dependence on the parameter formula_2. formula_2 is not a formal argument of the function as it is considered to be fixed. However, each different value of the parameter gives a different probability density function. Then the \"parametric family\" of densities is the set of functions formula_6, where formula_7 denotes the set of all possible values that the parameter formula_8 can take. As an example, the normal distribution is a family of similarly-shaped distributions parametrized by their mean and their variance.\n\nIn decision theory, two-moment decision models can be applied when the decision-maker is faced with random variables drawn from a location-scale family of probability distributions.\n\nIn economics, the Cobb–Douglas production function is a family of production functions parametrized by the elasticities of output with respect to the various factors of production.\n\nIn algebra, the quadratic equation, for example, is actually a family of equations parametrized by the coefficients of the variable and of its square and by the constant term.\n\n"}

A diagram in the notation consists of several shapes linked together by lines. The notation has been studied extensively by Predrag Cvitanović, who used it to classify the classical Lie groups. It has also been generalized using representation theory to spin networks in physics, and with the presence of matrix groups to trace diagrams in linear algebra.\n\nIn the language of multilinear algebra, each shape represents a multilinear function. The lines attached to shapes represent the inputs or outputs of a function, and attaching shapes together in some way is essentially the composition of functions.\n\nIn the language of tensor algebra, a particular tensor is associated with a particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to contraction of indices. One advantage of this notation is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly basis-independent.\n\nEach shape represents a matrix, and tensor multiplication is done horizontally, and matrix multiplication is done vertically.\n\nThe metric tensor is represented by a U-shaped loop or an upside-down U-shaped loop, depending on the type of tensor that is used.\nThe Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor is represented by a thick horizontal bar with sticks pointing downwards or upwards, depending on the type of tensor that is used.\n\nThe structure constants (formula_1) of a Lie algebra are represented by a small triangle with one line pointing upwards and two lines pointing downwards.\n\nContraction of indices is represented by joining the index lines together.\n\nSymmetrization of indices is represented by a thick zig-zag or wavy bar crossing the index lines horizontally.\n\nAntisymmetrization of indices is represented by a thick straight line crossing the index lines horizontally.\n\nThe determinant is formed by applying antisymmetrization to the indices.\n\nThe covariant derivative (formula_2) is represented by a circle around the tensor(s) to be differentiated and a line joined from the circle pointing downwards to represent the lower index of the derivative.\n\nThe diagrammatic notation is useful in manipulating tensor algebra. It usually involves a few simple \"identities\" of tensor manipulations.\n\nFor example, formula_3, where \"n\" is the number of dimensions, is a common \"identity\".\n\nThe Ricci and Bianchi identities given in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor illustrate the power of the notation\n\nThe notation has been extended with support for spinors and twistors.\n\n"}
{"id": "40765261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40765261", "title": "Point process notation", "text": "Point process notation\n\nIn probability and statistics, point process notation comprises the range of mathematical notation used to symbolically represent random objects known as point processes, which are used in related fields such as stochastic geometry, spatial statistics and continuum percolation theory and frequently serve as mathematical models of random phenomena, representable as points, in time, space or both.\n\nThe notation varies due to the histories of certain mathematical fields and the different interpretations of point processes, and borrows notation from mathematical areas of study such as measure theory and set theory.\n\nThe notation, as well as the terminology, of point processes depends on their setting and interpretation as mathematical objects which under certain assumptions can be interpreted as random sequences of points, random sets of points or random counting measures.\n\nIn some mathematical frameworks, a given point process may be considered as a sequence of points with each point randomly positioned in \"d\"-dimensional Euclidean space R as well as some other more abstract mathematical spaces. In general, whether or not a random sequence is equivalent to the other interpretations of a point process depends on the underlying mathematical space, but this holds true for the setting of finite-dimensional Euclidean space R.\n\nA point process is called \"simple\" if no two (or more points) coincide in location with probability one. Given that often point processes are simple and the order of the points does not matter, a collection of random points can be considered as a random set of points The theory of random sets was independently developed by David Kendall and Georges Matheron. In terms of being considered as a random set, a sequence of random points is a random closed set if the sequence has no accumulation points with probability one\n\nA point process is often denoted by a single letter, for example formula_1, and if the point process is considered as a random set, then the corresponding notation:\n\nis used to denote that a random point formula_3 is an element of (or belongs to) the point process formula_1. The theory of random sets can be applied to point processes owing to this interpretation, which alongside the random sequence interpretation has resulted in a point process being written as:\n\nwhich highlights its interpretation as either a random sequence or random closed set of points. Furthermore, sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point formula_6 (or formula_7) belongs to or is a point of the point process formula_8, or with set notation, formula_9.\n\nTo denote the number of points of formula_1 located in some Borel set formula_11, it is sometimes written \n\nwhere formula_13 is a random variable and formula_14 is a counting measure, which gives the number of points in some set. In this mathematical expression the point process is denoted by:\n\nformula_1.\n\nOn the other hand, the symbol:\n\nformula_16\n\nrepresents the number of points of formula_1 in formula_11. In the context of random measures, one can write:\n\nformula_19\n\nto denote that there is the set formula_11 that contains formula_21 points of formula_22. In other words, a point process can be considered as a random measure that assigns some non-negative integer-valued measure to sets. This interpretation has motivated a point process being considered just another name for a \"random counting measure\" and the techniques of random measure theory offering another way to study point processes, which also induces the use of the various notations used in integration and measure theory. \n\nThe different interpretations of point processes as random sets and counting measures is captured with the often used notation in which:\n\n\nDenoting the counting measure again with formula_14, this dual notation implies:\n\nIf formula_29 is some measurable function on R, then the sum of formula_30 over all the points formula_31 in formula_32 can be written in a number of ways such as:\n\nwhich has the random sequence appearance, or with set notation as:\n\nor, equivalently, with integration notation as:\n\nwhere formula_36 is the space of all possible counting measures, hence putting an emphasis on the interpretation of formula_1 as a random counting measure. An alternative integration notation may be used to write this integral as:\n\nThe dual interpretation of point processes is illustrated when writing the number of formula_1 points in a set formula_11 as:\n\nwhere the indicator function formula_42 if the point formula_31 is exists in formula_11 and zero otherwise, which in this setting is also known as a Dirac measure. In this expression the random measure interpretation is on the left-hand side while the random set notation is used is on the right-hand side.\n\nThe average or expected value of a sum of functions over a point process is written as:\n\nwhere (in the random measure sense) formula_46 is an appropriate probability measure defined on the space of counting measures formula_36. The expected value of formula_48 can be written as:\n\nwhich is also known as the first moment measure of formula_1. The expectation of such a random sum, known as a \"shot noise process\" in the theory of point processes, can be calculated with .\n\nPoint processes are employed in other mathematical and statistical disciplines, hence the notation may be used in fields such stochastic geometry, spatial statistics or continuum percolation theory, and areas which use the methods and theory from these fields.\n\n"}

The power law for cache misses was first established by C. K. Chow in his 1974 paper, supported by experimental data on hit ratios for stack processing by Richard Mattson in 1971. The power law of cache misses can be used to narrow down the cache sizes to practical ranges, given a tolerable miss rate, as one of the early steps while designing the cache hierarchy for a uniprocessor system.\n\nThe power law for cache misses can be stated as\n\nwhere \"M\" is the miss rate for a cache of size \"C\" and \"M\" is the miss rate of a baseline cache. The exponent \"α\" is workload-specific and typically ranges from 0.3 to 0.7.\n\nThe power law can only give an estimate of the miss rate only up to a certain value of cache size. A large enough cache eliminates capacity misses and increasing the cache size further will not reduce the miss rate any further, contrary to the power law's prediction.\n\nThe validity of the power law of cache misses also depends on the size of working memory set in a given process and also on the temporal re-reference pattern of cache blocks in a process. If a process has a small working memory set relative to the cache size, capacity misses are unlikely and the power law does not hold.\n\nAlthough conflict misses reduce as associativity increases, Hartstein et al. showed that the power law holds irrespective of set associativity.\n\nHartstein et al. plotted the number of cache block re-accesses versus their re-reference times for a large number of workloads and found that most also follow an exponential relationship.\n\nwhere \"R\"(\"t\") is the rate of re-referencing. It was found that the exponent \"β\" ranged between 1.7 and 1.3. Theoretically, it was proved that the power laws of cache re-reference and cache miss rate are related by the equation formula_3. This means that for workloads that do not follow the re-reference power law, the power law of cache misses does not hold true.\n\nIn a multilevel cache hierarchy, the miss pattern of the higher level cache becomes the re-reference pattern of the immediate lower level cache. Hartstein et al. found that whereas the cache misses for lower levels do not follow a strict power law, as long as the lower level cache is considerably larger than the higher level cache, the miss rate function can be approximated to the power law.\n\n"}

Generally considered a relationship of great intimacy, mathematics has already been described as \"an essential tool for physics\" and physics has already been described as \"a rich source of inspiration and insight in mathematics\".\n\nIn his work \"Physics\", one of the topics treated by Aristotle is about how the study carried out by mathematicians differs from that carried out by physicists. Considerations about mathematics being the language of nature can be found in the ideas of the Pythagoreans: the convictions that \"Numbers rule the world\" and \"All is number\", and two millennia later were also expressed by Galileo Galilei: \"The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics\".\n\nBefore giving a mathematical proof for the formula for the volume of a sphere, Archimedes used physical reasoning to discover the solution (imagining the balancing of bodies on a scale). From the seventeenth century, many of the most important advances in mathematics appeared motivated by the study of physics, and this continued in the following centuries (although, it has already been appointed that from the nineteenth century, mathematics started to become increasingly independent from physics). The creation and development of calculus were strongly linked to the needs of physics: There was a need for a new mathematical language to deal with the new dynamics that had arisen from the work of scholars such as Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. During this period there was little distinction between physics and mathematics; as an example, Newton regarded geometry as a branch of mechanics. As time progressed, increasingly sophisticated mathematics started to be used in physics. The current situation is that the mathematical knowledge used in physics is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as in the case of superstring theory.\n\nSome of the problems considered in the philosophy of mathematics are the following:\n\n\nIn recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics. This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in mathematics education, such as Felix Klein, Richard Courant, Vladimir Arnold and Morris Kline, to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.\n\n\n\n"}

It is commonly used by scientists, mathematicians and engineers, in part because it can simplify certain arithmetic operations. On scientific calculators it is usually known as \"SCI\" display mode.\nIn scientific notation all numbers are written in the form \n(\"m\" times ten raised to the power of \"n\"), where the exponent \"n\" is an integer, and the coefficient \"m\" is any real number, called the \"significand\" or \"mantissa\". However, the term \"mantissa\" may cause confusion because it is the name of the fractional part of the common logarithm. If the number is negative then a minus sign precedes \"m\" (as in ordinary decimal notation). In normalized notation, the exponent is chosen so that the absolute value of the coefficient is at least one but less than ten.\n\nDecimal floating point is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.\n\nAny given real number can be written in the form in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as or or .\n\nIn \"normalized\" scientific notation (called \"standard form\" in the UK), the exponent \"n\" is chosen so that the absolute value of \"m\" remains at least one but less than ten (1 ≤ |\"m\"| < 10). Thus 350 is written as . This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent \"n\" gives the number's order of magnitude. In normalized notation, the exponent \"n\" is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as ). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.\n\nNormalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as engineering notation, is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called exponential notation—although the latter term is more general and also applies when \"m\" is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to bases other than 10 (for example, ).\n\nEngineering notation (often named \"ENG\" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent \"n\" is restricted to multiples of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of \"m\" is in the range 1 ≤ |\"m\"| < 1000, rather than 1 ≤ |\"m\"| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding SI prefixes, which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, can be read as \"twelve-point-five nanometers\" and written as , while its scientific notation equivalent would likely be read out as \"one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters\".\n\nA significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes indicated to be significant.\nLeading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, 1,230,400 usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.\n\nWhen a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus 1,230,400 would become 1.2304 × 10. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) 1.23040 × 10. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.\n\nIt is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).\n\nAdditional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are. For instance, the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as , which is shorthand for .\n\nMost calculators and many computer programs present very large and very small results in scientific notation, typically invoked by a key labelled (for \"exponent\"), (for \"enter exponent\"), , , , or depending on vendor and model. Because superscripted exponents like 10 cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter \"E\" (or \"e\") is often used to represent \"times ten raised to the power of\" (which would be written as \"× 10\") and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers \"m\" and \"n\", the usage of \"\"m\"E\"n\"\" would indicate a value of \"m\" × 10. In this usage the character \"e\" is not related to the mathematical constant \"e\" or the exponential function \"e\" (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital \"E\"). Although the \"E\" stands for \"exponent\", the notation is usually referred to as \"(scientific) E-notation\" rather than \"(scientific) exponential notation\". The use of E-notation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes, avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display, but it is not encouraged in some publications.\n\n\n\nScientific notation also enables simpler order-of-magnitude comparisons. A proton's mass is . If written as , it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below. The order of magnitude of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more error-prone task of counting the leading zeros. In this case, −27 is larger than −31 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ( times) more massive than the electron.\n\nScientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as \"billion\", which might indicate either 10 or 10.\n\nIn physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as \"dex\", a contraction of \"decimal exponent\". For instance, if two numbers are within 1 dex of each other, then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10. Fractional values can be used, so if within 0.5 dex, the ratio is less than 10, and so on.\n\nIn normalized scientific notation, in E-notation, and in engineering notation, the space (which in typesetting may be represented by a normal width space or a thin space) that is allowed \"only\" before and after \"×\" or in front of \"E\" is sometimes omitted, though it is less common to do so before the alphabetical character.\n\n\nConverting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form, convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation. None of these alter the actual number, only how it's expressed.\n\nFirst, move the decimal separator point sufficient places, \"n\", to put the number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal was moved to the left, append \"× 10\"\"\"; to the right, \"× 10\"\"\". To represent the number in normalized scientific notation, the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and \"× 10\" appended, resulting in . The number would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield as a result.\n\nConverting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation, first remove the \"× 10\" on the end, then shift the decimal separator \"n\" digits to the right (positive \"n\") or left (negative \"n\"). The number would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become , while would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be .\n\nConversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The decimal separator in the significand is shifted \"x\" places to the left (or right) and \"x\" is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.\n\nGiven two numbers in scientific notation,\n\nand\n\nMultiplication and division are performed using the rules for operation with exponentiation:\n\nand\n\nSome examples are:\nand\n\nAddition and subtraction require the numbers to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted:\n\nNext, add or subtract the significands:\n\nAn example:\n\nWhile base ten is normally used for scientific notation, powers of other bases can be used too, base 2 being the next most commonly used one.\n\nFor example, in base-2 scientific notation, the number 1001 in binary (=9) is written as \n1.001 × 2 or 1.001 × 10 using binary numbers (or shorter 1.001 × 10 if binary context is obvious). In E-notation, this is written as 1.001E11 (or shorter: 1.001E11) with the letter \"E\" now standing for \"times two (10) to the power\" here. In order to better distinguish this base-2 exponent from a base-10 exponent, a base-2 exponent is sometimes also indicated by using the letter \"B\" instead of \"E\", a shorthand notation originally proposed by Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1968, as in 1.001B11 (or shorter: 1.001B11). For comparison, the same number in decimal representation: 1.125 × 2 (using decimal representation), or 1.125B3 (still using decimal representation). Some calculators use a mixed representation for binary floating point numbers, where the exponent is displayed as decimal number even in binary mode, so the above becomes 1.001 × 10 or shorter 1.001B3.\n\nThis is closely related to the base-2 floating-point representation commonly used in computer arithmetic, and the usage of IEC binary prefixes (e.g. 1B10 for 1×2 (kibi), 1B20 for 1×2 (mebi), 1B30 for 1×2 (gibi), 1B40 for 1×2 (tebi)).\n\nSimilar to \"B\" (or \"b\"), the letters \"H\" (or \"h\") and \"O\" (or \"o\", or \"C\") are sometimes also used to indicate \"times 16 or 8 to the power\" as in 1.25 = 1.40 × 10 = 1.40H0 = 1.40h0, or 98000 = 2.7732 × 10 = 2.7732o5 = 2.7732C5.\n\nAnother similar convention to denote base-2 exponents is using a letter \"P\" (or \"p\", for \"power\"). In this notation the significand is always meant to be hexadecimal, whereas the exponent is always meant to be decimal. This notation can be produced by implementations of the \"printf\" family of functions following the C99 specification and (Single Unix Specification) IEEE Std 1003.1 POSIX standard, when using the \"%a\" or \"%A\" conversion specifiers. Starting with C++11, C++ I/O functions could parse and print the P-notation as well. Meanwhile, the notation has been fully adopted by the language standard since C++17. Apple's Swift supports it as well. It is also required by the IEEE 754-2008 binary floating-point standard. Example: 1.3DEp42 represents 1.3DE × 2.\n\nEngineering notation can be viewed as a base-1000 scientific notation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7951270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7951270", "title": "Sign (mathematics)", "text": "Sign (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, the concept of sign originates from the property of every non-zero real number of being positive or negative. Zero itself is signless, although in some contexts it makes sense to consider a signed zero, and in some contexts it makes sense to call 0 its own sign. Along with its application to real numbers, \"change of sign\" is used throughout mathematics and physics to denote the additive inverse (negation, or multiplication by −1), even for quantities which are not real numbers (so, which are not prescribed to be either positive, negative, or zero). Also, the word \"sign\" can indicate aspects of mathematical objects that resemble positivity and negativity, such as the sign of a permutation (see below).\n\nEvery number has multiple attributes (such as value, sign and magnitude). A real number is said to be positive if its value (\"not\" its magnitude) is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign (though this is context dependent, see below). Also, signs are not defined for complex numbers, although the argument generalizes it in some sense.\n\nIn common numeral notation (which is used in arithmetic and elsewhere), the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus sign or a minus sign before the number. For example, +3 denotes \"positive three\", and −3 denotes \"negative three\". When no plus or minus sign is given, the default interpretation is that a number is positive. Because of this notation, as well as the definition of negative numbers through subtraction, the minus sign is perceived to have a strong association with negative numbers (of the negative sign). Likewise, \"+\" associates with positivity.\n\nIn algebra, a minus sign is usually thought of as representing the operation of additive inverse (sometimes called \"negation\"), with the additive inverse of a positive number being negative and the additive inverse of a negative number being positive. In this context, it makes sense to write −(−3) = +3.\n\nAny non-zero number can be changed to a positive one using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.\n\nThe number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both denote the same number 0, which is the additive inverse of itself.\n\nNote that this definition is culturally determined. In France and Belgium, 0 is said to be both positive and negative. The positive numbers without zero and the negative numbers without zero are said to be \"strictly positive\" and \"strictly negative\" respectively.\n\nIn some contexts, such as signed number representations in computing, it makes sense to consider signed versions of zero, with positive zero and negative zero being different numbers (see signed zero).\n\nOne also sees +0 and −0 in calculus and mathematical analysis when evaluating one-sided limits. This notation refers to the behaviour of a function as the input variable approaches 0 from positive or negative values respectively; these behaviours are not necessarily the same.\n\nBecause zero is neither positive nor negative (in most countries), the following phrases are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:\nThus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.\n\nThe same terminology is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.\n\nIn many contexts the choice of sign convention (which range of values is considered positive and which negative) is natural, whereas in others the choice is arbitrary subject only to consistency, the latter necessitating an explicit sign convention.\n\nThe sign function or signum function is sometimes used to extract the sign of a number. This function is usually defined as follows:\nThus sgn(\"x\") is 1 when \"x\" is positive, and sgn(\"x\") is −1 when \"x\" is negative. For nonzero values of \"x\", this function can also be defined by the formula\nwhere |\"x\"| is the absolute value of \"x\".\n\nIn many contexts, it is common to associate a sign with the measure of an angle, particularly an oriented angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign indicates whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.\n\nIt is also possible to associate a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed rotation around an oriented axis typically counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.\n\nWhen a quantity \"x\" changes over time, the change in the value of \"x\" is typically defined by the equation\n\nUsing this convention, an increase in \"x\" counts as positive change, while a decrease of \"x\" counts as negative change. In calculus, this same convention is used in the definition of the derivative. As a result, any increasing function has positive derivative, while a decreasing function has negative derivative.\n\nIn analytic geometry and physics, it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative. For a basic example, the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:\n\nAs a result, when discussing linear motion, displacement or velocity to the right is usually thought of as being positive, while similar motion to the left is thought of as being negative.\n\nOn the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive \"x\"-direction, and upward being the positive \"y\"-direction. If a displacement or velocity vector is separated into its vector components, then the horizontal part will be positive for motion to the right and negative for motion to the left, while the vertical part will be positive for motion upward and negative for motion downward.\n\nIn computing, an integer value may be either signed or unsigned, depending on whether the computer is keeping track of a sign for the number. By restricting an integer variable to non-negative values only, one more bit can be used for storing the value of a number. Because of the way integer arithmetic is done within computers, the sign of a signed integer variable is usually not stored as a single independent bit, but is instead stored using two's complement or some other signed number representation.\n\nIn contrast, real numbers are stored and manipulated as Floating point values. The floating point values are represented using three separate values, mantissa, exponent, and sign. Given this separate sign bit, it is possible to represent both positive and negative zero. Most programming languages normally treat positive zero and negative zero as equivalent values, albeit, they provide means by which the distinction can be detected.\n\nIn addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences:\n\n"}

{"id": "20029977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20029977", "title": "The Story of Maths", "text": "The Story of Maths\n\nThe Story of Maths is a four-part British television series outlining aspects of the history of mathematics. It was a co-production between the Open University and the BBC and aired in October 2008 on BBC Four. The material was written and presented by University of Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy. The consultants were the Open University academics Robin Wilson, professor Jeremy Gray and June Barrow-Green. Kim Duke is credited as series producer.\n\nThe series comprised four programmes respectively titled: \"The Language of the Universe\"; \"The Genius of the East\"; \"The Frontiers of Space\"; and\" To Infinity and Beyond\". Du Sautoy documents the development of mathematics covering subjects such as the invention of zero and the unproven Riemann hypothesis, a 150-year-old problem for whose solution the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1,000,000 prize. He escorts viewers through the subject's history and geography. He examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how mathematical ideas underpin the world's science, technology, and culture.\n\nHe starts his journey in ancient Egypt and finishes it by looking at current mathematics. Between he travels through Babylon, Greece, India, China, and the medieval Middle East. He also looks at mathematics in Europe and then in America and takes the viewers inside the lives of many of the greatest mathematicians.\n\nIn this opening programme Marcus du Sautoy looks at how important and fundamental mathematics is to our lives before looking at the mathematics of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece.\n\nDu Sautoy commences in Egypt where recording the patterns of the seasons and in particular the flooding of the Nile was essential to their economy. There was a need to solve practical problems such as land area for taxation purposes. Du Sautoy discovers the use of a decimal system based on the fingers on the hands, the unusual method for multiplication and division. He examines the Rhind Papyrus, the Moscow Papyrus and explores their understanding of binary numbers, fractions and solid shapes.\n\nHe then travels to Babylon and discovered that the way we tell the time today is based on the Babylonian 60 base number system. So because of the Babylonians we have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. He then shows how the Babylonians used quadratic equations to measure their land. He deals briefly with Plimpton 322.\n\nIn Greece, the home of ancient Greek mathematics, he looks at the contributions of some of its greatest and well known mathematicians including Pythagoras, Plato, Euclid, and Archimedes, who are some of the people who are credited with beginning the transformation of mathematics from a tool for counting into the analytical subject we know today. A controversial figure, Pythagoras’ teachings were considered suspect and his followers seen as social outcasts and a little be strange and not in the norm. There is a legend going around that one of his followers, Hippasus, was drowned when he announced his discovery of irrational numbers. As well as his work on the properties of right angled triangles, Pythagoras developed another important theory after observing musical instruments. He discovered that the intervals between harmonious musical notes are always in whole number intervals. It deals briefly with Hypatia of Alexandria.\n\nWith the decline of ancient Greece, the development of maths stagnated in Europe. However the progress of mathematics continued in the East. Du Sautoy describes both the Chinese use of maths in engineering projects and their belief in the mystical powers of numbers. He mentions Qin Jiushao.\n\nHe describes Indian mathematicians’ invention of trigonometry; their introduction of a symbol for the number zero and their contribution to the new concepts of infinity and negative numbers. It shows Gwalior Fort where zero is inscribed on its walls. It mentions the work of Brahmagupta and Bhāskara II on the subject of zero. He mentions Madhava of Sangamagrama and Aryabhata and illustrates the - historically first exact - formula for calculating the π (pi).\n\nDu Sautoy then considers the Middle East: the invention of the new language of algebra and the evolution of a solution to cubic equations. He talks about the House of Wisdom with Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī and he visits University of Al-Karaouine. He mentions Omar Khayyám.\n\nFinally he examines the spread of Eastern knowledge to the West through mathematicians such as Leonardo Fibonacci, famous for the Fibonacci sequence. He mentions Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia.\n\nFrom the seventeenth century, Europe replaced the Middle East as the engine house of mathematical ideas. Du Sautoy visits Urbino to introduce perspective using mathematician and artist, Piero della Francesca's \"The Flagellation of Christ\".\n\nDu Sautoy proceeds to describes René Descartes realisation that it was possible to describe curved lines as equations and thus link algebra and geometry. He talks with Henk J. M. Bos about Descartes. He shows how one of Pierre de Fermat’s theorems is now the basis for the codes that protect credit card transactions on the internet. He describes Isaac Newton’s development of math and physics crucial to understanding the behaviour of moving objects in engineering. He covers the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy and the Bernoulli family. He further covers Leonhard Euler, the father of topology, and Gauss' invention of a new way of handling equations, modular arithmetic. He mentions János Bolyai.\n\nThe further contribution of Gauss to our understanding of how prime numbers are distributed is covered thus providing the platform for Bernhard Riemann's theories on prime numbers. In addition Riemann worked on the properties of objects, which he saw as manifolds that could exist in multi-dimensional space.\n\nThe final episode considers the great unsolved problems that confronted mathematicians in the 20th century. On 8 August 1900 David Hilbert gave a historic talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Hilbert posed twenty-three then unsolved problems in mathematics which he believed were of the most immediate importance. Hilbert succeeded in setting the agenda for 20thC mathematics and the programme commenced with Hilbert's first problem.\n\nGeorg Cantor considered the infinite set of whole numbers 1, 2, 3 ... ∞ which he compared with the smaller set of numbers 10, 20, 30 ... ∞. Cantor showed that these two infinite sets of numbers actually had the same size as it was possible to pair each number up; 1 - 10, 2 - 20, 3 - 30 ... etc.\n\nIf fractions now are considered there are an infinite number of fractions between any of the two whole numbers, suggesting that the infinity of fractions is bigger than the infinity of whole numbers. Yet Cantor was still able to pair each such fraction to a whole number 1 - /; 2 - /; 3 - / ... etc. through to ∞; i.e. the infinities of both fractions and whole numbers were shown to have the same size.\n\nBut when the set of all infinite decimal numbers was considered, Cantor was able to prove that this produced a bigger infinity. This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others.\n\nHowever, there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals? Cantor believed, in what became known as the Continuum Hypothesis, that there is no such set. This would be the first problem listed by Hilbert.\n\nNext Marcus discusses Henri Poincaré's work on the discipline of 'Bendy geometry'. If two shapes can be moulded or morphed to each other's shape then they have the same topology. Poincaré was able to identify all possible two-dimensional topological surfaces; however in 1904 he came up with a topological problem, the Poincaré conjecture, that he could not solve; namely what are all the possible shapes for a 3D universe.\n\nAccording to the programme, the question was solved in 2002 by Grigori Perelman who linked the problem to a different area of mathematics. Perelman looked at the dynamics of the way things can flow over the shape. This enabled him to find all the ways that 3D space could be wrapped up in higher dimensions.\n\nThe achievements of David Hilbert were now considered. In addition to Hilbert's problems, Hilbert space, Hilbert Classification and the Hilbert Inequality, du Sautoy highlights Hilbert's early work on equations as marking him out as a mathematician able to think in new ways. Hilbert showed that, while there were an infinity of equations, these equations could be constructed from a finite number of building block like sets. Hilbert could not construct that list of sets; he simply proved that it existed. In effect Hilbert had created a new more abstract style of Mathematics.\n\nFor 30 years Hilbert believed that mathematics was a universal language powerful enough to unlock all the truths and solve each of his 23 Problems. Yet, even as Hilbert was stating \"We must know, we will know\", Kurt Gödel had shattered this belief; he had formulated the Incompleteness Theorem based on his study of Hilbert's second problem:\n\nUsing a code based on prime numbers, Gödel was able to transform the above into a pure statement of arithmetic. Logically, the above cannot be false and hence Gödel had discovered the existence of mathematical statements that were true but were incapable of being proved.\n\nIn 1950s American mathematician Paul Cohen took up the challenge of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which asks \"is there is or isn't there an infinite set of number bigger than the set of whole numbers but smaller than the set of all decimals\". Cohen found that there existed two equally consistent mathematical worlds. In one world the Hypothesis was true and there did not exist such a set. Yet there existed a mutually exclusive but equally consistent mathematical proof that Hypothesis was false and there was such a set. Cohen would subsequently work on Hilbert's eighth problem, the Riemann hypothesis, although without the success of his earlier work.\n\nHilbert's tenth problem asked if there was some universal method that could tell whether any equation had whole number solutions or not. The growing belief was that no so such method was possible yet the question remained, how could you prove that, no matter how ingenious you were, you would never come up with such a method. He mentions Paul Cohen. To answer this Julia Robinson, who created the Robinson Hypothesis which stated that to show that there was no such method all you had to do was cook up one equation whose solutions were a very specific set of numbers: The set of numbers needed to grow exponentially yet still be captured by the equations at the heart of Hilbert's problem. Robinson was unable to find this set. This part of the solution fell to Yuri Matiyasevich who saw how to capture the Fibonacci sequence using the equations at the heart of Hilbert's tenth.\n\nThe final section briefly covers algebraic geometry. Évariste Galois had refined a new language for mathematics. Galois believed mathematics should be the study of structure as opposed to number and shape. Galois had discovered new techniques to tell whether certain equations could have solutions or not. The symmetry of certain geometric objects was the key. Galois' work was picked up by André Weil who built algebraic geometry, a whole new language. Weil's work connected number theory, algebra, topology and geometry.\n\nFinally du Sautoy mentions Weil's part in the creation of the fictional mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki and another contributor to Bourbaki's output - Alexander Grothendieck.\n\n\n"}

Rényi [69] reported the following story about the Jew Bar Kochba in 135 CE, who defended his fortress against the Romans.

He escaped from captivity and reported back to Bar Kochba, but being unable to talk, he could not tell in words what he had seen.

V\"flo\" uses radar rainfall data for hydrologic input to simulate distributed runoff. V\"flo\" employs GIS maps for parameterization via a desktop interface. The model is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and in continuous operations. V\"flo\" output is in the form of hydrographs at selected drainage network grids, as well as distributed runoff maps covering the watershed. Model applications include civil infrastructure operations and maintenance, stormwater prediction and emergency management, continuous and short-term surface water runoff, recharge estimation, soil moisture monitoring, land use planning, water quality monitoring, and water resources management.\n\nV\"flo\" considers the spatial character of the parameters and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in hydrologic modeling. Historical practice has been to use lumped representations because of computational limitations or because sufficient data was not available to populate a distributed model database. Advances in computational speed; development of high-resolution precipitation data from radar and satellites; and availability of worldwide digital data sets and GIS technology makes distributed, physics-based modeling possible. V\"flo\" is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution radar rainfall input, GIS datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics. Because it is physics-based, it produces hydrographs based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the drainage network, and can be employed in locations where there are no rain gauges or previous modeling studies. In addition, V\"flo\"’s network approach makes models scalable from upland watersheds to river basins using the same drainage network.\n\nV\"flo\" is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations. V\"flo\" models may be calibrated by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak hydrographs to observed hydrographs. Elevation data are taken from a digital elevation model. A vector channel representation is employed. Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including LIDAR terrain data and other digital maps of impervious area, soils, and land use/cover. V\"flo\" is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from radar, satellites, rain gauges, or model forecasts. The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a watershed.\n\n\n"}

Laureate of State Prize of USSR, of Prize of Cabinet Council of USSR, he is a Honoured Scholar of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Burkov is a vice-president of Russian Project Management Association (SOVNET) (the Russian branch of International Project Management Association, IPMA), Member of Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. A professor at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Head of Laboratory at V.A. Trapeznikov Institute of Control Sciences of RAS, in the end of 1960s he pioneered the theory of active systems (which was a Soviet version of the theory of mechanism design).\n\nVladimir Burkov was born on November 17, 1939, in the city of Vologda. In 1963 he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) and was employed by Institute of Automation and Remote Control (since 1970s it is known as ICS RAS, V.A. Trapeznikov Institute of Control Sciences of RAS), where he earned his Candidate of Sciences degree in 1966, and became Doctor of Sciences in 1975. In 1981 he earned professorship at the Chair of Control Sciences at MIPT and since 1974 he works as a Head of Laboratory 57 (Laboratory of active systems) at ICS RAS.\n\nMarried to Elena Burkova, the couple has a daughter Irina, who also earned the doctoral degree for her contributions to control theory.\n\nEarly academic interests of Vladimir Burkov were connected with applied problems of combinatorial optimization; in 1960s he contributed to the boom of project scheduling and network planning, proposed novel models of resource allocation in organizations and in technical systems, solved several extremal graph problems. In particular, Vladimir Burkov proposed a lower-bound estimate of the project makespan in resource-constrained project scheduling problem re-invented in 1998 by A. Mingozzi et al. Two books by Vladimir Burkov, \"Network models and control problems\" and \"Applied problems of graph theory\" put forward the problems being intensively studied until now.\n\nSince late 1960s interests of Vladimir Burkov shift to the studies of specific nature of human being as a controlled object (an agent). In 1969 he pursued an idea of the \"fairplay principle\" (in Russian: принцип открытого управления): plans assigned to selfish agents by the optimal control mechanism must be coordinated with agents' goal functions. Under such an incentive-compatible mechanism truthtelling is benefitiary for agents. The notion of incentive compatibility was independently proposed by Leonid Hurwitz, and later was extended and elaborated by Allan Gibbard, Roger Myerson, and many other researchers. They pioneered the revelation principle, which opened a new era in the studies of economic institutions (mechanism design and contract theory); it was mentioned as the main achievement in 2007s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences won by L. Hurwitz, E. Maskin, and R. Myerson.\n\nThe fairplay principle became the foundation of the newly introduced \"theory of active systems\" (a version of mechanism design originated from USSR), which systematically studied control mechanisms in man-machine systems. In 1970s the seminal books and articles determined the directions of theory development for many decades to come (some books of early 2010s are ).\n\nIn 1973 V. Burkov headed the newly created division in the Institute of Automation and Remote Control called \"the Sector of Business Games\"; in 1974 it was re-organized into the Laboratory 57 \"Theory and methods of business games\" later renamed to \"Laboratory of Active Systems\". As of the end of 2016 its headcount is 28 employees including 15 Doctors of Sciences and 5 Candidates of Sciences. During the decades V. Burkov superwised dozens of thesis works.\n\nProfessor Dmitry Novikov, corresponding member of Russian Academy of Sciences (since 2008), was elected a director of ICS RAS on October 17, 2016.\n"}
