It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as cellular automata. Wolfram calls these systems \"simple programs\" and argues that the scientific philosophy and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.\n\nThe thesis of \"A New Kind of Science\" (\"NKS\") is twofold: that the nature of computation must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the physical world. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: engineering, which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and mathematics, which seeks to prove theorems about computation. However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.\n\nWolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe complex systems, and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.\n\nThe basic subject of Wolfram's \"new kind of science\" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary computer programs. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; mobile automata; Turing machines in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested recursive functions; combinators; tag systems; register machines; reversal-addition. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:\n\nGenerally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things. This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of emergence. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a brute-force search through all of the possible components for the best match.\n\nSimple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be universal computers. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as thermodynamic behavior, continuum behavior, conserved quantities, percolation, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and others. They have been used as models of traffic, material fracture, crystal growth, biological growth, and various sociological, geological, and ecological phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall complexity. \"A New Kind of Science\" argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any complex system.\n\nIn order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like physics or chemistry. The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.\n\nThe proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.\n\nAnother kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the \"NKS\" framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.\n\nWolfram has since expressed \"A central lesson of \"A New Kind of Science\" is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes.\"\n\nWhile Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science, grounded equally in both abstraction and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in \"NKS\" is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.\n\nWolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of reverse engineering our theories from observation, we can enumerate systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of \"NKS\" is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.\n\nWolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing principle of science. For instance, he argues that the concept of \"computational irreducibility\" (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be \"reduced\"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional mathematical models. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.\n\nBased on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the principle of computational equivalence (PCE): the principle states that systems found in the natural world can perform computations up to a maximal (\"universal\") level of computational power. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating input and outputs from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.\n\nThe principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience randomness and complexity: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of \"heat,\" but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the \"normal science\" of the \"NKS\" paradigm.\n\nAt the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not \"special\"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.\n\nThere are a number of specific results and ideas in the \"NKS\" book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.\n\nFirst, there are several cases where the \"NKS\" book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal Turing Machine, and the shortest axiom for propositional calculus. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like phase transitions, conserved quantities, continuum behavior, and thermodynamics that are familiar from traditional science. Simple computational models of natural systems like shell growth, fluid turbulence, and phyllotaxis are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.\n\nAnother common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a holistic way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform evolutionary theory, SETI, free will, computational complexity theory, and philosophical fields like ontology, epistemology, and even postmodernism.\n\nWolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally deterministic universe. He posits that the computational process in the brain of the being with free will is actually complex enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility. Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.\n\nThe book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.\n\nThe book contains a new technical result in describing the Turing completeness of the Rule 110 cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol universal Turing machine. Wolfram conjectures that a particular 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal. Alex Smith, a computer science student from Birmingham, UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.\n\nEvery year, Wolfram and his group of instructors organize a summer school. From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at Brown University. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the University of Vermont at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in Pisa, Italy. In 2012, the program was held at Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses. Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.\n\nPeriodicals gave \"A New Kind of Science\" coverage, including articles in \"The New York Times\", \"Newsweek\", \"Wired\", and \"The Economist\". Some scientists criticized the book as abrasive and arrogant, and perceived a fatal flaw—that simple systems such as cellular automata are not complex enough to describe the degree of complexity present in evolved systems, and observed that Wolfram ignored the research categorizing the complexity of systems. Although critics accept Wolfram's result showing universal computation, they view it as minor and dispute Wolfram's claim of a paradigm shift. Others found that the work contained valuable insights and refreshing ideas. Wolfram addressed his critics in a series of blog posts.\n\nIn an article published on April 3, 2018, \"A New Kind of Science\" was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.\n\nA tenet of \"NKS\" is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, \"NKS\" argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. \"NKS\" has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.\n\nA common criticism of \"NKS\" is that it does not follow established scientific methodology. For instance, \"NKS\" does not establish rigorous mathematical definitions, nor does it attempt to prove theorems; and most formulas and equations are written in Mathematica rather than standard notation. Along these lines, \"NKS\" has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning. It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of complexity, particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective. And it has been criticized for misrepresenting chaos theory: \"Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC).\"\n\n\"NKS\" has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research. There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. Steven Weinberg has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.\n\nThe Principle of computational equivalence has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions. It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property. Moreover, critics such as Ray Kurzweil have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent. Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the Church–Turing thesis.\n\nWolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. Scott Aaronson, Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both special relativity and Bell's theorem violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of Bell test experiments. However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of Quantum gravity that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft, see also replies to criticism of digital physics.\n\nEdward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse pioneered the idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that \"NKS\" tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.\n\nIn a 2002 review of \"NKS\", the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist Steven Weinberg wrote, \"Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood.\"\n\nNobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, \"[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a space-time lattice with lattice length formula_1\"\n\nWolfram's claim that natural selection is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the theory of evolution.\n\n\"NKS\" has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.\n\nThe authoritative manner in which \"NKS\" presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing complete, was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, Matthew Cook. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in chaos theory and complex systems.\n\n\n"}

Abstract structures are studied not only in logic and mathematics but in the fields that apply them, as computer science, and in the studies that reflect on them, such as philosophy (especially the philosophy of mathematics). Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the Bourbaki group: see discussion there, at algebraic structure and also structure).\n\nAn abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects this is called an implementation or instantiation of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.\n\nAn abstract structure has a richer structure than a concept or an idea. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of democracy, but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "42148664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42148664", "title": "Benacerraf's identification problem", "text": "Benacerraf's identification problem\n\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, Benacerraf's identification problem is a philosophical argument, developed by Paul Benacerraf, against set-theoretic Platonism. In 1965, Benacerraf published a paradigm changing article entitled \"What Numbers Could Not Be\". Historically, the work became a significant catalyst in motivating the development of mathematical structuralism.\n\nThe identification problem argues that there exists a fundamental problem in reducing natural numbers to pure sets. Since there exists an infinite number of ways of identifying the natural numbers with pure sets, no particular set-theoretic method can be determined as the \"true\" reduction. Benacerraf infers that any attempt to make such a choice of reduction immediately results in generating a meta-level, set-theoretic falsehood, namely in relation to other elementarily-equivalent set-theories not identical to the one chosen. The identification problem argues that this creates a fundamental problem for Platonism, which maintains that mathematical objects have a real, abstract existence. Benacerraf's dilemma to Platonic set-theory is arguing that the Platonic attempt to identify the \"true\" reduction of natural numbers to pure sets, as revealing the intrinsic properties of these abstract mathematical objects, is impossible. As a result, the identification problem ultimately argues that the relation of set theory to natural numbers cannot have an ontologically Platonic nature.\n\nThe historical motivation for the development of Benacerraf's identification problem derives from a fundamental problem of ontology. Since Medieval times, philosophers have argued as to whether the ontology of mathematics contains abstract objects. In the philosophy of mathematics, an abstract object is traditionally defined as an entity that: (1) exists independent of the mind; (2) exists independent of the empirical world; and (3) has eternal, unchangeable properties. Traditional mathematical Platonism maintains that some set of mathematical elements–natural numbers, real numbers, functions, relations, systems–are such abstract objects. Contrarily, mathematical nominalism denies the existence of any such abstract objects in the ontology of mathematics. \nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, a number of anti-Platonist programs gained in popularity. These included intuitionism, formalism, and predicativism. By the mid-20th century, however, these anti-Platonist theories had a number of their own issues. This subsequently resulted in a resurgence of interest in Platonism. It was in this historic context that the motivations for the identification problem developed.\n\nThe identification problem begins by evidencing some set of elementarily-equivalent, set-theoretic models of the natural numbers. Benacerraf considers two such set-theoretic methods:\n\nAs Benacerraf demonstrates, both method I and II reduce natural numbers to sets. Benacerraf formulates the dilemma as a question: which of these set-theoretic methods uniquely provides the true identity statements, which elucidates the true ontological nature of the natural numbers? Either method I or II could be used to define the natural numbers and subsequently generate true arithmetical statements to form a mathematical system. In their relation, the elements of such mathematical systems are isomorphic in their structure. However, the problem arises when these isomorphic structures are related together on the meta-level. The definitions and arithmetical statements from system I are not identical to the definitions and arithmetical statements from system II. For example, the two systems differ in their answer to whether 0 ∈ 2, insofar as ∅ is not an element of . Thus, in terms of failing the transitivity of identity, the search for true identity statements similarly fails. By attempting to reduce the natural numbers to sets, this renders a set-theoretic falsehood between the isomorphic structures of different mathematical systems. This is the essence of the identification problem.\n\nAccording to Benacerraf, the philosophical ramifications of this identification problem result in Platonic approaches failing the ontological test. The argument is used to demonstrate the impossibility for Platonism to reduce numbers to sets that reveals the existence of abstract objects.\n\n\n"}

Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion necessarily follows. The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that \"if it were true\" it would lead to the consequent.\n\nConditional proofs are of great importance in mathematics. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven conjectures, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition's truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.\n\nA famous network of conditional proofs is the NP-complete class of complexity theory. There are a large number of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them.

It is simply a finite sequence of positive integers separated by rightward arrows, e.g. 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.\n\nAs with most combinatorial notations, the definition is recursive. In this case the notation eventually resolves to being the leftmost number raised to some (usually enormous) integer power.\n\nA \"Conway chain\" is defined as follows:\n\nAny chain represents an integer, according to the four rules below. Two chains are said to be equivalent if they represent the same integer.\n\nIf formula_2 and formula_3 are positive integers, and formula_4 is a subchain, then:\n\nNote that the last rule can be restated recursively to avoid the ellipses:\n\n\nOne must be careful to treat an arrow chain \"as a whole\". Arrow chains do not describe the iterated application of a binary operator. Whereas chains of other infixed symbols (e.g. 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) can often be considered in fragments (e.g. (3 + 4) + 5 + (6 + 7)) without a change of meaning (see associativity), or at least can be evaluated step by step in a prescribed order, e.g. 3 from right to left, that is not so with Conway's arrow.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe fourth rule is the core: A chain of 3 or more elements ending with 2 or higher becomes a chain of the same length with a (usually vastly) increased penultimate element. But its \"ultimate\" element is decremented, eventually permitting the third rule to shorten the chain.

In its slight plot, the aging Ovid is duped by a go-between, and renounces love affairs. Its interest to modern readers lies in the discursive padding of the story.\n\nIts actual author, \"Pseudo-Ovidius\" to scholars, has been thought to be Richard de Fournival; but this is not universally accepted.

The authorship of Ovid was questioned by the fifteenth-century humanist Angelo Decembrio; in fact Petrarch had already denied that Ovid could be the poet.\n\nThere was a translation or paraphrase of the 1370s into French as \"La vieille\" (\"The Old Woman\") by Jean Le Fèvre.

It has proven instrumental in the development of logic and modern science, and its logical rigor was not surpassed until the 19th century.\n\nEuclid's \"Elements\" has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written. It was one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and has been estimated to be second only to the Bible in the number of editions published since the first printing in 1482, with the number reaching well over one thousand. For centuries, when the quadrivium was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's \"Elements\" was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.\n\nScholars believe that the \"Elements\" is largely a compilation of propositions based on books by earlier Greek mathematicians.\n\nProclus (412–485 AD), a Greek mathematician who lived around seven centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary on the \"Elements\": \"Euclid, who put together the \"Elements\", collecting many of Eudoxus' theorems, perfecting many of Theaetetus', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors\".\n\nPythagoras (c. 570–495 BC) was probably the source for most of books I and II, Hippocrates of Chios (c. 470–410 BC, not the better known Hippocrates of Kos) for book III, and Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 408–355 BC) for book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians. The \"Elements\" may have been based on an earlier textbook by Hippocrates of Chios, who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures.\n\nIn the fourth century AD, Theon of Alexandria produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until François Peyrard's 1808 discovery at the Vatican of a manuscript not derived from Theon's. This manuscript, the Heiberg manuscript, is from a Byzantine workshop around 900 and is the basis of modern editions. Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29 is a tiny fragment of an even older manuscript, but only contains the statement of one proposition.\n\nAlthough known to, for instance, Cicero, no record exists of the text having been translated into Latin prior to Boethius in the fifth or sixth century. The Arabs received the \"Elements\" from the Byzantines around 760; this version was translated into Arabic under Harun al Rashid c. 800. The Byzantine scholar Arethas commissioned the copying of one of the extant Greek manuscripts of Euclid in the late ninth century. Although known in Byzantium, the \"Elements\" was lost to Western Europe until about 1120, when the English monk Adelard of Bath translated it into Latin from an Arabic translation.\n\nCopies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the Vatican Library and the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been made about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).\n\nAncient texts which refer to the \"Elements\" itself, and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written, are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by J. L. Heiberg and Sir Thomas Little Heath in their editions of the text.\n\nAlso of importance are the scholia, or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or further study.\n\nThe \"Elements\" is still considered a masterpiece in the application of logic to mathematics. In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of science. Scientists Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Sir Isaac Newton were all influenced by the \"Elements\", and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, Alfred North Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell, have attempted to create their own foundational \"Elements\" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.\n\nThe austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, \"You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight\". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet \"\", \"O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!\". Einstein recalled a copy of the \"Elements\" and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the \"holy little geometry book\".\n\nThe success of the \"Elements\" is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the \"Elements\", encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The \"Elements\" still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.\n\n\nEuclid's axiomatic approach and constructive methods were widely influential.\n\nMany of Euclid's propositions were constructive, demonstrating the existence of some figure by detailing the steps he used to construct the object using a compass and straightedge. His constructive approach appears even in his geometry's postulates, as the first and third postulates stating the existence of a line and circle are constructive. Instead of stating that lines and circles exist per his prior definitions, he states that it is possible to 'construct' a line and circle. It also appears that, for him to use a figure in one of his proofs, he needs to construct it in an earlier proposition. For example, he proves the Pythagorean theorem by first inscribing a square on the sides of a right triangle, but only after constructing a square on a given line one proposition earlier.\n\nAs was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed proof in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as Theon often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.\n\nEuclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles, the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward Alexandrian system of numerals.\n\nThe presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the 'enunciation', which states the result in general terms (i.e., the statement of the proposition). Then comes the 'setting-out', which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the 'definition' or 'specification', which restates the enunciation in terms of the particular figure. Then the 'construction' or 'machinery' follows. Here, the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the 'proof' itself follows. Finally, the 'conclusion' connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.\n\nNo indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the \"Data\" does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the \"Elements\". Some scholars have tried to find fault in Euclid's use of figures in his proofs, accusing him of writing proofs that depended on the specific figures drawn rather than the general underlying logic, especially concerning Proposition II of Book I. However, Euclid's original proof of this proposition, is general, valid, and does not depend on the figure used as an example to illustrate one given configuration.\n\nEuclid's list of axioms in the \"Elements\" was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. Later editors have interpolated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms.\n\nFor example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal, then they are congruent; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1 – I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.\n\nMathematician and historian W. W. Rouse Ball put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that \"the fact that for two thousand years [the \"Elements\"] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose.\"\n\nIt was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the apocryphal books XIV and XV of the \"Elements\" were sometimes included in the collection. The spurious Book XIV was probably written by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise by Apollonius. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being\n\nThe spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by Isidore of Miletus. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The purpose of this article is to present common ways of creating generating functions.\n\nNew generating functions can be created by extending simpler generating functions. For example, starting with\n\nand replacing formula_2 with formula_3, we obtain\n\nOne can define generating functions in several variables, for series with several indices. These are often called super generating functions, and for 2 variables are often called bivariate generating functions.\n\nFor instance, since formula_5 is the generating function for binomial coefficients for a fixed \"n,\" one may ask for a bivariate generating function that generates the binomial coefficients formula_6 for all \"k\" and \"n.\"\nTo do this, consider formula_5 as \"itself\" a series (in \"n\"), and find the generating function in \"y\" that has these as coefficients. Since the generating function for formula_8 is just formula_9, the generating function for the binomial coefficients is:\nand the coefficient on formula_11 is the formula_6 binomial coefficient.\n\nConsider the problem of finding a closed formula for the Fibonacci numbers \"F\" defined by \"F\" = 0, \"F\" = 1, and \"F\" = \"F\" + \"F\" for \"n\" ≥ 2. We form the ordinary generating function\n\nfor this sequence. The generating function for the sequence (\"F\") is \"xf\" and that of (\"F\") is \"x\"\"f\".

{"id": "5280515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5280515", "title": "Exceptional object", "text": "Exceptional object\n\nMany branches of mathematics study objects of a given type and prove a classification theorem. A common theme is that the classification results in a number of series of objects and a finite number of exceptions that do not fit into any series. These are known as exceptional objects. Frequently these exceptional objects play a further and important role in the subject. Furthermore, the exceptional objects in one branch of mathematics are often related to the exceptional objects in others.\n\nA related phenomenon is exceptional isomorphism, when two series are in general different, but agree for some small values.\n\nThe prototypical examples of exceptional objects arise in the classification of regular polytopes. In two dimensions there is a series of regular \"n\"-gons for \"n\" ≥ 3. In every dimension above 2 we find analogues of the cube, tetrahedron and octahedron. In three dimensions we find two more regular polyhedra — the dodecahedron (12-hedron) and the icosahedron (20-hedron) — making five Platonic solids. In four dimensions we have a total of six regular polytopes including the 120-cell, the 600-cell and the 24-cell. There are no other regular polytopes; in higher dimensions the only regular polytopes are of the hypercube, simplex, orthoplex series. In all dimensions combined, there are therefore three series and five exceptional polytopes.\n\nThe pattern is similar if non-convex polytopes are included. In two dimensions there is a regular star polygon for every rational number \"p\"/\"q\" > 2. In three dimensions there are four Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra, and in four dimensions ten Schläfli–Hess polychora; in higher dimensions there are no non-convex regular figures.\n\nThese can be generalized to tessellations of other spaces, especially uniform tessellations, notably tilings of Euclidean space (honeycombs), which have exceptional objects, and tilings of hyperbolic space. There are various exceptional objects in dimension below 6, but in dimension 6 and above the only regular polyhedra/tilings/hyperbolic tilings are the simplex, hypercube, cross-polytope, and hypercube lattice.\n\nRelated to tilings and the regular polyhedra, there are exceptional Schwarz triangles (triangles that tile the sphere, or more generally Euclidean plane or hyperbolic plane via their triangle group of reflections in their edges), particularly the Möbius triangles. In the sphere there are 3 Möbius triangles (and 1 1-parameter family), corresponding to the 3 exceptional Platonic solid groups, while in the Euclidean plane there are 3 Möbius triangles, corresponding to the 3 special triangles: 60-60-60 (equilateral), 45-45-90 (isosceles right), and 30-60-90. There are additional exceptional Schwarz triangles in the sphere and Euclidean plane. By contrast, in the hyperbolic plane there is a 3-parameter family of Möbius triangles, and none exceptional.\n\nThe finite simple groups have been classified into a number of series as well as 26 sporadic groups. Of these, 20 are subgroups or subquotients of the monster group, referred to as the \"Happy Family\", while 6 are not, and are referred to as \"pariahs\".\n\nSeveral of the sporadic groups are related to the Leech lattice, most notably the Conway group Co, which is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, quotiented out by its center.\n\nThere are only three finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the reals — the real numbers, the complex numbers and the quaternions. The only non-associative division algebra is the algebra of octonions. The octonions are connected to a wide variety of exceptional objects. For example, the exceptional formally real Jordan algebra is the Albert algebra of 3 by 3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions.\n\nThe simple Lie groups form a number of series (classical Lie groups) labelled A, B, C and D. In addition there are the exceptional groups G (the automorphism group of the octonions), F, E, E, E. These last four groups can be viewed as the symmetry groups of projective planes over O, C⊗O, H⊗O and O⊗O respectively, where O is the octonions and the tensor products are over the reals.\n\nThe classification of Lie groups corresponds to the classification of root systems and thus the exceptional Lie groups correspond to exceptional root systems and exceptional Dynkin diagrams.\n\nThere are a few exceptional objects with supersymmetry. The classification of superalgebras by Kac and Tierry-Mieg indicates that the Lie superalgebras G(3) in 31 dimensions and F(4) in 40 dimensions, and the Jordan superalgebras K and K, are examples of exceptional objects.\n\nUp to isometry there is only one even unimodular lattice in 15 dimensions or less — the E lattice. Up to dimension 24 there is only one even unimodular lattice without roots, the Leech lattice. Three of the sporadic simple groups were discovered by Conway while investigating the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. For example, Co is the automorphism group itself modulo ±1. The groups Co and Co, as well as a number of other sporadic groups, arise as stabilisers of various subsets of the Leech lattice.\n\nSome codes also stand out as exceptional objects, in particular the perfect binary Golay code which is closely related to the Leech lattice. The Mathieu group formula_1, one of the sporadic simple groups, is the group of automorphisms of the extended binary Golay code, and four more of the sporadic simple groups arise as various types of stabilizer subgroup of formula_1.\n\nAn exceptional block design is the Steiner system S(5,8,24) whose automorphism group is the sporadic simple Mathieu group formula_1.\n\nThe codewords of the extended binary Golay code have a length of 24 bits and have weights 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. This code can correct up to three errors. So every 24-bit word with weight 5 can be corrected to a codeword with weight 8. The bits of a 24-bit word can be thought of as specifying the possible subsets of a 24 element set. So the extended binary Golay code gives a unique 8 element subset for each 5 element subset. In fact, it defines S(5,8,24).\n\nCertain families of groups generically have a certain outer automorphism group, but in particular cases they have other, exceptional outer automorphisms.\n\nAmong families of finite simple groups, the only example is in the automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups: for formula_4 the alternating group formula_5 has one outer automorphism (corresponding to conjugation by an odd element of formula_6) and the symmetric group formula_6 has no outer automorphisms. However, for formula_8 there is an exceptional outer automorphism of formula_9 (of order 2), and correspondingly, the outer automorphism group of formula_10 is not formula_11 (the group of order 2) but rather formula_12, the Klein four-group.\n\nIf one instead considers A as the (isomorphic) projective special linear group PSL(2,9), then the outer automorphism is not exceptional; thus the exceptionalness can be seen as due to the exceptional isomorphism formula_13 This exceptional outer automorphism is realized inside of the Mathieu group M and similarly, M acts on a set of 12 elements in 2 different ways.\n\nAmong Lie groups, the spin group Spin(8) has an exceptionally large outer automorphism group (namely formula_14), which corresponds to the exceptional symmetries of the Dynkin diagram D. This phenomenon is referred to as \"triality.\"\n\nThe exceptional symmetry of the D diagram also gives rise to the Steinberg groups.\n\nThe Kervaire invariant is an invariant of a (4\"k\"+2)-dimensional manifold that measures whether the manifold could be surgically converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. More specifically, the Kervaire invariant applies to a framed manifold, that is, to a manifold equipped with an embedding into Euclidean space and a trivialization of the normal bundle. The Kervaire invariant problem is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For differentiable manifolds, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open. These five or six framed cobordism classes of manifolds having Kervaire invariant 1 are exceptional objects related to exotic spheres. The first three cases are related to the complex numbers, quaternions and octonions respectively: a manifold of Kervaire invariant 1 can be constructed as the product of two spheres, with its exotic framing determined by the normed division algebra.\n\nDue to similarities of dimensions, it is conjectured that the remaining cases (dimensions 30, 62 and 126) are related to the Rosenfeld projective planes, which are defined over algebras constructed from the octonions. Specifically, it has been conjectured that there is a construction that takes these projective planes and produces a manifold with nonzero Kervaire invariant in two dimensions lower, but this remains unconfirmed.\n\nIn quantum information theory, there exist structures known as SIC-POVMs or SICs, which correspond to maximal sets of complex equiangular lines. Some of the known SICs—those in vector spaces of 2 and 3 dimensions, as well as certain solutions in 8 dimensions—are considered exceptional objects and called \"sporadic SICs\". They differ from the other known SICs in ways that involve their symmetry groups, the Galois theory of the numerical values of their vector components, and so forth. The sporadic SICs in dimension 8 are related to the integral octonions.\n\nNumerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects. Most common are objects related to 8 and 24 dimensions, noting that 24 = 8 · 3. By contrast, the pariah groups stand apart, as the name suggests.\n\nExceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.\nLikewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include the following.\n\nThese objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves \"exceptional\". For example, in algebraic topology, 8-fold real Bott periodicity can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of modular forms, the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the Dedekind eta function and the modular discriminant, which connection is deepened by Monstrous moonshine, a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.\n\nIn string theory and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena. For example, bosonic string theory requires a spacetime of dimension 26 which is directly related to the presence of 24 in the Dedekind eta function. Similarly, the possible dimensions of supergravity are related to the dimensions of the division algebras.\n\nMany of the exceptional objects in mathematics and physics have been found to be connected to each other. Developments such as the Monstrous moonshine conjectures show how, for example, the Monster group is connected to string theory. The theory of modular forms shows how the algebra E is connected to the Monster group. (In fact, well before the proof of the Monstrous moonshine conjecture, the elliptic \"j\"-function was discovered to encode the representations of E.) Other interesting connections include how the Leech lattice is connected via the Golay code to the adjacency matrix of the dodecahedron (another exceptional object). Below is a mind map showing how some of the exceptional objects in mathematics and mathematical physics are related.\n\nThe connections can partly be explained by thinking of the algebras as a tower of lattice vertex operator algebras. It just so happens that the vertex algebras at the bottom are so simple that they are isomorphic to familiar non-vertex algebras. Thus the connections can be seen simply as the consequence of some lattices being sub-lattices of others.\n\nThe Jordan superalgebras are a parallel set of exceptional objects with supersymmetry. These are the Lie superalgebras which are related to Lorentzian lattices. This subject is less explored, and the connections between the objects are less well established. There are new conjectures parallel to the Monstrous moonshine conjectures for these super-objects, involving different sporadic groups.\n\n\"Exceptional\" object is reserved for objects that are unusual, meaning rare, the exception, not for \"unexpected\" or \"non-standard\" objects. These unexpected-but-typical (or common) phenomena are generally referred to as pathological, such as nowhere differentiable functions, or \"exotic\", as in exotic spheres — there are exotic spheres in arbitrarily high dimension (not only a finite set of exceptions), and in many dimensions most (differential structures on) spheres are exotic.\n\nExceptional objects must be distinguished from \"extremal\" objects: those that fall in a family and are the most extreme example by some measure are of interest, but not unusual in the way exceptional objects are. For example, the golden ratio \"φ\" has the simplest continued fraction approximation, and accordingly is most difficult to approximate by rationals; however, it is but one of infinitely many such quadratic numbers (continued fractions).\n\nSimilarly, the (2,3,7) Schwarz triangle is the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, and the associated (2,3,7) triangle group is of particular interest, being the universal Hurwitz group, and thus being associated with the Hurwitz curves, the maximally symmetric algebraic curves. However, it falls in a family of such triangles ((2,4,7), (2,3,8), (3,3,7), etc.), and while the smallest, is not exceptional or unlike the others.\n\n"}

Since floor and ceiling are not periodic, they do not have uniformly convergent Fourier series expansions. The fractional part function has Fourier series expansion\n\nfor not an integer.\n\nAt points of discontinuity, a Fourier series converges to a value that is the average of its limits on the left and the right, unlike the floor, ceiling and fractional part functions: for \"y\" fixed and \"x\" a multiple of \"y\" the Fourier series given converges to \"y\"/2, rather than to \"x\" mod \"y\" = 0. At points of continuity the series converges to the true value.\n\nUsing the formula floor(x) = x − {x} gives\n\nfor not an integer.\n\nFor an integer \"x\" and a positive integer \"y\", the modulo operation, denoted by \"x\" mod \"y\", gives the value of the remainder when \"x\" is divided by \"y\". This definition can be extended to real \"x\" and \"y\", \"y\" ≠ 0, by the formula\n\nThen it follows from the definition of floor function that this extended operation satisfies many natural properties.

One example is that a positive integer \"n\" is a prime if and only if\n\nOne may also give formulas for producing the prime numbers. For example, let \"p\" be the \"n\" prime, and for any integer \"r\" > 1, define the real number \"α\" by the sum\n\nThen\n\nA similar result is that there is a number \"θ\" = 1.3064...

This is historical as the first machines used ones' complement and truncation was simpler to implement (floor is simpler in two's complement). FORTRAN was defined to require this behavior and thus almost all processors implement conversion this way. Some consider this to be an unfortunate historical design decision that has led to bugs handling negative offsets and graphics on the negative side of the origin.\n\nMany programming languages (including C, C++,Java,PHP ,R, and Python) provide standard functions for floor and ceiling, usually called codice_11 and codice_12.\n\nMost spreadsheet programs support some form of a codice_13 function. Although the details differ between programs, most implementations support a second parameter—a multiple of which the given number is to be rounded to. For example, codice_14 rounds 2 up to the nearest multiple of 3, giving 3. The definition of what \"round up\" means, however, differs from program to program.\n\nUntil Excel 2010, Microsoft Excel's codice_13 function was incorrect for negative arguments; ceiling(-4.5) was -5. This has followed through to the Office Open XML file format. Excel 2010 now follows the standard definition. Meanwhile, its codice_16 function continues to round away from zero.\n\nThe OpenDocument file format, as used by OpenOffice.org, Libreoffice and others, follows the mathematical definition of ceiling for its codice_13 function, with an optional parameter for Excel compatibility. For example, codice_18 returns −4.\n\n\n\n"}

Early Cubists, Surrealists, Futurists, and abstract artists took ideas from higher-dimensional mathematics and used them to radically advance their work.\n\nFrench mathematician Maurice Princet was known as \"le mathématicien du cubisme\" (\"the mathematician of cubism\"). An associate of the School of Paris, a group of avant-gardists including Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Jean Metzinger, and Marcel Duchamp, Princet is credited with introducing the work of Henri Poincaré and the concept of the \"fourth dimension\" to the cubists at the Bateau-Lavoir during the first decade of the 20th century.\n\nPrincet introduced Picasso to Esprit Jouffret's \"Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions\" (\"Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions\", 1903), a popularization of Poincaré's \"Science and Hypothesis\" in which Jouffret described hypercubes and other complex polyhedra in four dimensions and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's \"Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler\" in 1910 was an important work for the artist, who spent many months shaping it. The portrait bears similarities to Jouffret's work and shows a distinct movement away from the Proto-Cubist fauvism displayed in \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", to a more considered analysis of space and form.\n\nEarly cubist Max Weber wrote an article entitled \"In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View\", for Alfred Stieglitz's July 1910 issue of \"Camera Work\". In the piece, Weber states, \"In plastic art, I believe, there is a fourth dimension which may be described as the consciousness of a great and overwhelming sense of space-magnitude in all directions at one time, and is brought into existence through the three known measurements.\"\n\nAnother influence on the School of Paris was that of Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, both painters and theoreticians. The first major treatise written on the subject of Cubism was their 1912 collaboration \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", which says that: \"If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidian mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.\"\n\nThe American modernist painter and photographer Morton Livingston Schamberg wrote in 1910 two letters to Walter Pach, parts of which were published in a review of the 1913 Armory Show for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", about the influence of the fourth dimension on avant-garde painting; describing how the artists' employed \"harmonic use of forms\" distinguishing between the \"representation or rendering of space and the designing in space\":\nIf we still further add to design in the third dimension, a consideration of weight, pressure, resistance, movement, as distinguished from motion, we arrive at what may legitimately be called design in the fourth dimension, or the harmonic use of what may arbitrarily be called volume. It is only at this point that we can appreciate the masterly productions of such a man as Cézanne.\n\nCézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired the Cubists to experiment with simultaneity, complex multiple views of the same subject, as observed from differing viewpoints at the same time.\n\nIn 1936 in Paris, Charles Tamkó Sirató published his \"Manifeste Dimensioniste\", which described how \n\nThe manifesto was signed by many prominent modern artists worldwide. Hans Arp, Francis Picabia, Kandinsky, Robert Delaunay and Marcel Duchamp amongst others added their names in Paris, then a short while later it was endorsed by artists abroad including László Moholy-Nagy, Joan Miró, David Kakabadze, Alexander Calder, and Ben Nicholson.\n\nIn 1953, the surrealist Salvador Dalí proclaimed his intention to paint \"an explosive, nuclear and hypercubic\" crucifixion scene. He said that, \"This picture will be the great metaphysical work of my summer\". Completed the next year, \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\" depicts Jesus Christ upon the net of a hypercube, also known as a tesseract. The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the painting as a \"new interpretation of an oft-depicted subject. ..[showing] Christ's spiritual triumph over corporeal harm.\"\n\nSome of Piet Mondrian's (1872–1944) abstractions and his practice of Neoplasticism are said to be rooted in his view of a utopian universe, with perpendiculars visually extending into another dimension.\n\nThe fourth dimension has been the subject of numerous fictional stories.\n\n\n\n\n"}

André Weil) around the presentation of international research papers and work in progress. The Séminaire Julia focussed on yearly themes and impulsed the Bourbaki movement. The Séminaire Nicolas Bourbaki is the most famous, but is atypical in a number of ways: it attempts to cover, if selectively, the whole of pure mathematics, and its talks are now, by convention, reports and surveys on research by someone not directly involved. More standard is a working group organised around a specialist area, with research talks given and written up 'from the horse's mouth'.\n\nHistorically speaking, the Séminaire Cartan of the late 1940s and early 1950s, around Henri Cartan, was one of the most influential. Publication in those days was by means of the duplicated \"exemplaire\" (limited distribution and not peer-reviewed).

The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the Pythagorean theorem, large enough to be seen from the Moon or Mars.\n\nAlthough credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a \"German Astronomer\" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact extraterrestrial life, and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a heliotrope, his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is credited with an 1820 proposal for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings in the form of drawing an immense right triangle and three squares on the surface of the Earth, intended as a symbolical representation of the Pythagorean theorem, large enough to be seen from the Moon or Mars. Details vary between sources, but typically the \"drawing\" was to be constructed on the Siberian tundra, and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat. Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders (sometimes called a \"windmill diagram\", as originated by Euclid), would demonstrate to such alien observers the reciprocal existence of intelligent life on Earth and its grounding in mathematics. Wheat was said to be chosen by Gauss for contrast with the pine tree borders \"because of its uniform color\".\n\nThe specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in University of Notre Dame Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, \"The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900\", in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:The history of this proposal ... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss ... the [proposal] appear[s]!Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, Joseph Johann Littrow's statement in \"Wunder des Himmels\" that \"one of our most distinguished geometers\" proposed that a geometric figure \"for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth\". and Patrick Scott's \"Love in the Moon\", in which a \"learned man\" is described as proposing a signal formed by a \"great plantation of tree\" in the form of \"47th Proposition of Euclid\" in \"the great African dessert \". In \"Chambers's Edinburgh Journal\" it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to \"communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand\".\n\nIn the writings of astronomers Asaph Hall and of Norman Lockyer, each refer separately to a \"German Astronomer\" who proposed the method of contact be by \"fire signals\" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, Simon Newcomb placed the origin of a Siberian triangle \"several hundred miles in extent\" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach. In lectures presented by François Arago at the Paris Observatory, he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed \"German geometer\", but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth. Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the Heliotrope in 1818, an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a square mirror to be seen away even in sunny weather.\n\nGauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to Heinrich Olbers, by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact extraterrestrial life: \"With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon ... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon.\" Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\" an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with Franz von Gruithuisen, Gauss stated words to the effect that \"the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common.\" Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.\n"}
{"id": "14922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14922", "title": "If and only if", "text": "If and only if\n\nIn logic and related fields such as mathematics and philosophy, if and only if (shortened iff) is a biconditional logical connective between statements.\n\nIn that it is biconditional (a statement of material equivalence), the connective can be likened to the standard material conditional (\"only if\", equal to \"if ... then\") combined with its reverse (\"if\"); hence the name. The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other (i.e. either both statements are true, or both are false). It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English \"if and only if\", with its pre-existing meaning.\n\nIn writing, phrases commonly used, with debatable propriety, as alternatives to P \"if and only if\" Q include: \"Q is necessary and sufficient for P\", \"P is equivalent (or materially equivalent) to Q\" (compare material implication), \"P precisely if Q\", \"P precisely (or exactly) when Q\", \"P exactly in case Q\", and \"P just in case Q\". Some authors regard \"iff\" as unsuitable in formal writing; others use it freely.\n\nIn logical formulae, logical symbols are used instead of these phrases; see the discussion of notation.\n\nThe truth table of \"P\" formula_1 \"Q\" is as follows:\nIt is equivalent to that produced by the XNOR gate, and opposite to that produced by the XOR gate.\n\nThe corresponding logical symbols are \"↔\", \"formula_1\", and \"≡\", and sometimes \"iff\". These are usually treated as equivalent. However, some texts of mathematical logic (particularly those on first-order logic, rather than propositional logic) make a distinction between these, in which the first, ↔, is used as a symbol in logic formulas, while ⇔ is used in reasoning about those logic formulas (e.g., in metalogic). In Łukasiewicz's notation, it is the prefix symbol 'E'.\n\nAnother term for this logical connective is exclusive nor.\n\nIn TeX \"if and only if\" is shown as a long double arrow: formula_3 via command \\iff.\n\nIn most logical systems, one proves a statement of the form \"P iff Q\" by proving \"if P, then Q\" and \"if Q, then P\". Proving this pair of statements sometimes leads to a more natural proof since there are not obvious conditions in which one would infer a biconditional directly. An alternative is to prove the disjunction \"(P and Q) or (not-P and not-Q)\", which itself can be inferred directly from either of its disjuncts—that is, because \"iff\" is truth-functional, \"P iff Q\" follows if P and Q have both been shown true, or both false.\n\nUsage of the abbreviation \"iff\" first appeared in print in John L. Kelley's 1955 book \"General Topology\".\nIts invention is often credited to Paul Halmos, who wrote \"I invented 'iff,' for 'if and only if'—but I could never believe I was really its first inventor.\" \n\nIt is somewhat unclear how \"iff\" was meant to be pronounced. In current practice, the single 'word' \"iff\" is almost always read as the four words \"if and only if\". However, in the preface of \"General Topology\", Kelley suggests that it should be read differently: \"In some cases where mathematical content requires 'if and only if' and euphony demands something less I use Halmos' 'iff'\". The authors of one discrete mathematics textbook suggest: \"Should you need to pronounce iff, really hang on to the 'ff' so that people hear the difference from 'if'\", implying that \"iff\" could be pronounced as .\n\nTechnically, definitions are always \"if and only if\" statements; many texts such as Kelley's \"General Topology\" follow the strict demands of logic, and use \"if and only if\" or \"iff\" in definitions of new terms (for instance, from \"General Topology\", p. 25: \"A set is countable iff it is finite or countably infinite\" [boldface in original]). However, this usage of \"if and only if\" is not universal; often, mathematical definitions follow the special convention that \"if\" is interpreted to mean \"if and only if\" (for example, one might say, \"A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover\").\n\n\nSufficiency is the converse of necessity. That is to say, given \"P\"→\"Q\" (i.e. if \"P\" then \"Q\"), \"P\" would be a sufficient condition for \"Q\", and \"Q\" would be a necessary condition for \"P\". Also, given \"P\"→\"Q\", it is true that \"¬Q\"→\"¬P\" (where ¬ is the negation operator, i.e. \"not\"). This means that the relationship between \"P\" and \"Q\", established by \"P\"→\"Q\", can be expressed in the following, all equivalent, ways:\nAs an example, take (1), above, which states \"P\"→\"Q\", where \"P\" is \"the fruit in question is an apple\" and \"Q\" is \"Madison will eat the fruit in question\". The following are four equivalent ways of expressing this very relationship:\nSo we see that (2), above, can be restated in the form of \"if...then\" as \"If Madison will eat the fruit in question, then it is an apple\"; taking this in conjunction with (1), we find that (3) can be stated as \"If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it; \"and\" if Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple\".\n\nEuler diagrams show logical relationships among events, properties, and so forth. \"P only if Q\", \"if P then Q\", and \"P→Q\" all mean that P is a subset, either proper or improper, of Q. \"P if Q\", \"if Q then P\", and Q→P all mean that Q is a proper or improper subset of P. \"P if and only if Q\" and \"Q if and only if P\" both mean that the sets P and Q are identical to each other.\n\nIff is used outside the field of logic. Wherever logic is applied, especially in mathematical discussions, it has the same meaning as above: it is an abbreviation for \"if and only if\", indicating that one statement is both necessary and sufficient for the other. This is an example of mathematical jargon. (However, as noted above, \"if\", rather than \"iff\", is more often used in statements of definition.)\n\nThe elements of \"X\" are \"all and only\" the elements of \"Y\" is used to mean: \"for any \"z\" in the domain of discourse, \"z\" is in \"X\" if and only if \"z\" is in \"Y\".\"\n\n\n"}

Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example Zeno of Elea, who proposed many paradoxes involving infinity, and Eudoxus of Cnidus, who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his method of exhaustion. Modern mathematics uses the general concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems, such as in calculus and set theory, and the idea is also used in physics and the other sciences.\n\nIn mathematics, \"infinity\" is often treated as a number (i.e., it counts or measures things: \"an infinite number of terms\") but it is not the same sort of number as either a natural or a real number.\n\nGeorg Cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called cardinalities). For example, the set of integers is countably infinite, while the infinite set of real numbers is uncountable.\n\nAncient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The ancient Indians and Greeks did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.\n\nThe earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from Anaximander, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus. He used the word apeiron which means infinite or limitless. However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from Zeno of Elea (born ), a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the Eleatic School founded by Parmenides. Aristotle called him the inventor of the dialectic. He is best known for his paradoxes, described by Bertrand Russell as \"immeasurably subtle and profound\".\n\nIn accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.\n\nHowever, recent readings of the Archimedes Palimpsest have found that Archimedes had an understanding about actual infinite quantities. According to \"Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Controls\", Archimedes has been found to be \"the first to rigorously address the science of infinity with infinitely large sets using precise mathematical proofs.\"\n\nThe Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:\n\nIn this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and ontological grounds, a distinction was made between (\"countless, innumerable\") and \"ananta\" (\"endless, unlimited\"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.\n\nEuropean mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 John Wallis first used the notation formula_1 for such a number in his \"De sectionibus conicis\" and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into infinitesimal strips of width on the order of formula_2 But in \"Arithmetica infinitorum\" (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending \"&c.\" For example, \"1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &c.\"\n\nIn 1699 Isaac Newton wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work \"De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas\".\n\nHermann Weyl opened a mathematico-philosophic address given in 1930 with:\n\nThe infinity symbol formula_1 (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in Unicode at and in LaTeX as codice_1.\n\nIt was introduced in 1655 by John Wallis, and, since its introduction, has also been used outside mathematics in modern mysticism and literary symbology.\n\nLeibniz, one of the co-inventors of infinitesimal calculus, speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the Law of Continuity.\n\nIn real analysis, the symbol formula_1, called \"infinity\", is used to denote an unbounded limit. The notation formula_5 means that \"x\" grows without bound, and formula_6 means that  \"x\" decreases without bound. If \"f\"(\"t\") ≥ 0 for every \"t\", then\n\nInfinity is also used to describe infinite series:\n\nInfinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled formula_16 and formula_17 can be added to the topological space of the real numbers, producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers. We can also treat formula_16 and formula_17 as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the real projective line. Projective geometry also refers to a line at infinity in plane geometry, a plane at infinity in three-dimensional space, and a hyperplane at infinity for general dimensions, each consisting of points at infinity.\n\nIn complex analysis the symbol formula_1, called \"infinity\", denotes an unsigned infinite limit. formula_5 means that the magnitude formula_22 of \"x\" grows beyond any assigned value. A point labeled formula_1 can be added to the complex plane as a topological space giving the one-point compactification of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional complex manifold, or Riemann surface, called the extended complex plane or the Riemann sphere. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely formula_24 for any nonzero complex number \"z\". In this context it is often useful to consider meromorphic functions as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of formula_1 at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of Möbius transformations.\n\nThe original formulation of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz used infinitesimal quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various logical systems, including smooth infinitesimal analysis and nonstandard analysis. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a hyperreal field; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian transfinites. For example, if H is an infinite number, then H + H = 2H and H + 1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to non-standard calculus is fully developed in .\n\nA different form of \"infinity\" are the ordinal and cardinal infinities of set theory. Georg Cantor developed a system of transfinite numbers, in which the first transfinite cardinal is aleph-null (ℵ), the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.\n\nDedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of one-to-one correspondence as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see Galileo's paradox where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its proper parts; this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. \"size\".\n\nCantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with well-ordered sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite sequences which are maps from the positive integers leads to mappings from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is countably infinite. If a set is too large to be put in one to one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called \"uncountable\". Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity. Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum formula_26 is greater than that of the natural numbers formula_27; that is, there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that formula_28 (see Cantor's diagonal argument or Cantor's first uncountability proof).\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, formula_29 (see Beth one). This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, even assuming the Axiom of Choice.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space.\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−π/2, π/2) and R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel). The second result was proved by Cantor in 1878, but only became intuitively apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.\n\nInfinite-dimensional spaces are widely used in geometry and topology, particularly as classifying spaces, such as Eilenberg−MacLane spaces. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional complex projective space K(Z,2) and the infinite-dimensional real projective space K(Z/2Z,1).\n\nThe structure of a fractal object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming \"smooth\"; they have infinite perimeters—some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the Koch snowflake.\n\nLeopold Kronecker was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the philosophy of mathematics called finitism, an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of constructivism and intuitionism.\n\nIn physics, approximations of real numbers are used for continuous measurements and natural numbers are used for discrete measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no measurable quantity could have an infinite value, for instance by taking an infinite value in an extended real number system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite plane wave exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.\n\nThe practice of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities does not come from \"a priori\" or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations . One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.\n\nThis point of view does not mean that infinity cannot be used in physics. For convenience's sake, calculations, equations, theories and approximations often use infinite series, unbounded functions, etc., and may involve infinite quantities. Physicists however require that the end result be physically meaningful. In quantum field theory infinities arise which need to be interpreted in such a way as to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called renormalization.\n\nHowever, there are some theoretical circumstances where the end result is infinity. One example is the singularity in the description of black holes. Some solutions of the equations of the general theory of relativity allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a mathematical singularity, or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This does not necessarily mean that physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of Newtonian gravity and Coulomb's law of electrostatics. At r=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.\n\nThe first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576. Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer Giordano Bruno proposed an unbounded universe in \"On the Infinite Universe and Worlds\": \"Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds.\"\n\nCosmologists have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical universe: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space \"go on forever\"? This is an open question of cosmology. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar topology. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.\n\nThe curvature of the universe can be measured through multipole moments in the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the WMAP spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.\n\nHowever, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.\n\nThe concept of infinity also extends to the multiverse hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as Michio Kaku, posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.\n\nIn logic an infinite regress argument is \"a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form A) no such series exists or (form B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g., of justification) that it is supposed to play.\"\n\nThe IEEE floating-point standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also indefinite values). These are defined as the result of arithmetic overflow, division by zero, and other exceptional operations.\n\nSome programming languages, such as Java and J, allow the programmer an explicit access to the positive and negative infinity values as language constants. These can be used as greatest and least elements, as they compare (respectively) greater than or less than all other values. They have uses as sentinel values in algorithms involving sorting, searching, or windowing.\n\nIn languages that do not have greatest and least elements, but do allow overloading of relational operators, it is possible for a programmer to \"create\" the greatest and least elements. In languages that do not provide explicit access to such values from the initial state of the program, but do implement the floating-point data type, the infinity values may still be accessible and usable as the result of certain operations.\n\nPerspective artwork utilizes the concept of vanishing points, roughly corresponding to mathematical points at infinity, located at an infinite distance from the observer. This allows artists to create paintings that realistically render space, distances, and forms. Artist M. C. Escher is specifically known for employing the concept of infinity in his work in this and other ways.\n\nVariations of chess played on an unbounded board are called infinite chess.\n\nCognitive scientist George Lakoff considers the concept of infinity in mathematics and the sciences as a metaphor. This perspective is based on the basic metaphor of infinity (BMI), defined as the ever-increasing sequence <1,2,3...>.\n\nThe symbol is often used romantically to represent eternal love. Several types of jewelry are fashioned into the infinity shape for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word comes from the Latin \"lēmniscātus\" meaning \"decorated with ribbons\", from the Greek λημνίσκος meaning ribbons, or alternatively may refer to the wool from which the ribbons were made.\n\nCurves that have been called a lemniscate include three quartic plane curves: the hippopede or lemniscate of Booth, the lemniscate of Bernoulli, and the lemniscate of Gerono. The study of lemniscates (and in particular the hippopede) dates to ancient Greek mathematics, but the term \"lemniscate\" for curves of this type comes from the work of Jacob Bernoulli in the late 17th century.\n\nThe consideration of curves with a figure-eight shape can be traced back to Proclus, a Greek Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 5th century AD. Proclus considered the cross-sections of a torus by a plane parallel to the axis of the torus. As he observed, for most such sections the cross section consists of either one or two ovals; however, when the plane is tangent to the inner surface of the torus, the cross-section takes on a figure-eight shape, which Proclus called a horse fetter (a device for holding two feet of a horse together), or \"hippopede\" in Greek. The name \"lemniscate of Booth\" for this curve dates to its study by the 19th-century mathematician James Booth.\n\nThe lemniscate may be defined as an algebraic curve, the zero set of the quartic polynomial formula_1 when the parameter \"d\" is negative. For positive values of \"d\" one instead obtains the oval of Booth.\n\nIn 1680, Cassini studied a family of curves, now called the Cassini oval, defined as follows: the locus of all points, the product of whose distances from two fixed points, the curves' foci, is a constant. Under very particular circumstances (when the half-distance between the points is equal to the square root of the constant) this gives rise to a lemniscate.\n\nIn 1694, Johann Bernoulli studied the lemniscate case of the Cassini oval, now known as the lemniscate of Bernoulli (shown above), in connection with a problem of \"isochrones\" that had been posed earlier by Leibniz. Like the hippopede, it is an algebraic curve, the zero set of the polynomial formula_2. Bernoulli's brother Jacob Bernoulli also studied the same curve in the same year, and gave it its name, the lemniscate. It may also be defined geometrically as the locus of points whose product of distances from two foci equals the square of half the interfocal distance. It is a special case of the hippopede (lemniscate of Booth), with formula_3, and may be formed as a cross-section of a torus whose inner hole and circular cross-sections have the same diameter as each other. The lemniscatic elliptic functions are analogues of trigonometric functions for the lemniscate of Bernoulli, and the lemniscate constants arise in evaluating the arc length of this lemniscate.\n\nAnother lemniscate, the lemniscate of Gerono or lemniscate of Huygens, is the zero set of the quartic polynomial formula_4. Viviani's curve, a three-dimensional curve formed by intersecting a sphere with a cylinder, also has a figure eight shape, and has the lemniscate of Gerono as its planar projection.\n\nOther figure-eight shaped algebraic curves include\n\n"}

{"id": "22656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22656", "title": "Operand", "text": "Operand\n\nIn mathematics an operand is the object of a mathematical operation, i.e. it is the object or quantity that is operated on.\n\nThe following arithmetic expression shows an example of operators and operands:\n\nIn the above example, '+' is the symbol for the operation called addition. \n\nThe operand '3' is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition operator, and the operand '6' is the other input necessary for the operation.\n\nThe result of the operation is 9. (The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)\n\nAn operand, then, is also referred to as \"one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation\".\n\nOperands may be complex, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.\n\nIn the above expression '(3 + 5)' is the first operand for the multiplication operator and '2' the second. The operand '(3 + 5)' is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands '3' and '5'.\n\nRules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:\n\nIn the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has operands of '3' and '5 × 2'.\n\nDepending on the mathematical notation being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage infix notation is the most common, however other notations also exist, such as the prefix and postfix notations. These alternate notations are most common within computer science.\n\nBelow is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers '1' and '2'\n\nIn a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the left most value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression\n\nthe first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2 + 2). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 2. The reader is required to find the value of 2 before going any further. The value of 2 is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:\n\nThe next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2 + 4) = 6. Our expression now looks like this:\n\nHaving calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 2. We find the value of 2, which is 4. What we have left is the expression\n\nThe next order of operation is multiplication. 4 × 4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:\n\nThe next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16 − 6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.\n\nSo the correct value for our original expression, 4 × 2 − (2 + 2), is 10. \n\nIt is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.\n\nThe number of operands of an operator is called its arity. Based on arity, operators are classified as nullary (no operands), unary (1 operand), binary (2 operands), ternary (3 operands) etc.\n\nIn computer programming languages, the definitions of operator and operand are almost the same as in mathematics.\n\nIn computing, an operand is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.\nA computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.\n\nAdditionally, in assembly language, an operand is a value (an argument) on which the instruction, named by mnemonic, operates. The operand may be a processor register, a memory address, a literal constant, or a label. A simple example (in the x86 architecture) is\n\nMOV DS, AX\n\nwhere the value in register operand codice_1 is to be moved (codice_2) into register codice_3. Depending on the instruction, there may be zero, one, two, or more operands.\n\n"}

FOL is now a core formalism of mathematical logic, and is presupposed by contemporary treatments of Peano arithmetic and nearly all treatments of axiomatic set theory.\n\nThe 1928 edition included a clear statement of the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) for FOL, and also asked whether that logic was complete (i.e., whether all semantic truths of FOL were theorems derivable from the FOL axioms and rules). The former problem was answered in the negative first by Alonzo Church and independently by Alan Turing in 1936. The latter was answered affirmatively by Kurt Gödel in 1929.\n\nThe text also touched on set theory and relational algebra as ways of going beyond FOL. Contemporary notation for logic owes more to this text than it does to the notation of \"Principia Mathematica\", long popular in the English speaking world.\n\n"}

This theorem applies to any formal theory that satisfies certain technical hypotheses, which are discussed as needed during the sketch. We will assume for the remainder of the article that a fixed theory satisfying these hypotheses has been selected.\n\nThroughout this article the word \"number\" refers to a natural number. The key property these numbers possess is that any natural number can be obtained by starting with the number 0 and adding 1 a finite number of times.\n\nGödel's theorem applies to any formal theory that satisfies certain properties. Each formal theory has a signature that specifies the nonlogical symbols in the language of the theory. For simplicity, we will assume that the language of the theory is composed from the following collection of 15 (and only 15) symbols:\n\n\nThis is the language of Peano arithmetic. A well-formed formula is a sequence of these symbols that is formed so as to have a well-defined reading as a mathematical formula. Thus is well formed while is not well formed. A theory is a set of well-formed formulas with no free variables.\n\nA theory is consistent if there is no formula such that both and its negation are provable. ω-consistency is a stronger property than consistency. Suppose that is a formula with one free variable . In order to be ω-consistent, the theory cannot prove both while also proving for each natural number .\n\nThe theory is assumed to be effective, which means that the set of axioms must be recursively enumerable. This means that it is theoretically possible to write a finite-length computer program that, if allowed to run forever, would output the axioms of the theory (necessarily including every well-formed instance of the axiom schema of induction) one at a time and not output anything else. This requirement is necessary; there are theories that are complete, consistent, and include elementary arithmetic, but no such theory can be effective.\n\nThe sketch here is broken into three parts. In the first part, each formula of the theory is assigned a number, known as a Gödel number, in a manner that allows the formula to be effectively recovered from the number. This numbering is extended to cover finite sequences of formulas. In the second part, a specific formula is constructed such that for any two numbers and holds if and only if represents a sequence of formulas that constitutes a proof of the formula that represents. In the third part of the proof, we construct a self-referential formula that, informally, says \"I am not provable\", and prove that this sentence is neither provable nor disprovable within the theory.\n\nImportantly, all the formulas in the proof can be defined by primitive recursive functions, which themselves can be defined in first-order Peano arithmetic.\n\nThe first step of the proof is to represent (well-formed) formulas of the theory, and finite lists of these formulas, as natural numbers. These numbers are called the Gödel numbers of the formulas.\n\nBegin by assigning a natural number to each symbol of the language of arithmetic, similar to the manner in which the ASCII code assigns a unique binary number to each letter and certain other characters. This article will employ the following assignment, very similar to the one Douglas Hofstadter used in his \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\":\n\nThe Gödel number of a formula is obtained by concatenating the Gödel numbers of each symbol making up the formula. The Gödel numbers for each symbol are separated by a zero because by design, no Gödel number of a symbol includes a . Hence any formula may be correctly recovered from its Gödel number. Let denote the Gödel number of the formula .\n\nGiven the above Gödel numbering, the sentence asserting that addition commutes, translates as the number:\n\n(Spaces have been inserted on each side of every 0 only for readability; Gödel numbers are strict concatenations of decimal digits.) Not all natural numbers represent a formula. For example, the number\n\ntranslates to \"\", which is not well-formed.\n\nBecause each natural number can be obtained by applying the successor operation to a finite number of times, every natural number has its own Gödel number. For example, the Gödel number corresponding to , is:\n\nThe assignment of Gödel numbers can be extended to finite lists of formulas. To obtain the Gödel number of a list of formulas, write the Gödel numbers of the formulas in order, separating them by two consecutive zeros. Since the Gödel number of a formula never contains two consecutive zeros, each formula in a list of formulas can be effectively recovered from the Gödel number for the list.\n\nIt is crucial that the formal arithmetic be capable of proving a minimum set of facts. In particular, it must be able to prove that every number has a Gödel number. A second fact that the theory must prove is that given any Gödel number of a formula with one free variable and any number , there is a Gödel number of the formula obtained by replacing all occurrences of in with , and that this second Gödel number can be effectively obtained from the Gödel number of as a function of . To see that this is in fact possible, note that given the Gödel number for , one can recreate the original formula, make the substitution, and then find the Gödel number of the resulting formula. This is a uniform procedure.\n\nDeduction rules can then be represented by binary relations on Gödel numbers of lists of formulas. In other words, suppose that there is a deduction rule , by which one can move from the formulas to a new formula . Then the relation corresponding to this deduction rule says that is related to (in other words, holds) if is the Gödel number of a list of formulas containing and and is the Gödel number of the list of formulas consisting of those in the list coded by together with . Because each deduction rule is concrete, it is possible to effectively determine for any natural numbers and whether they are related by the relation.\n\nThe second stage in the proof is to use the Gödel numbering, described above, to show that the notion of provability can be expressed within the formal language of the theory. Suppose the theory has deduction rules: . Let be their corresponding relations, as described above.\n\nEvery provable statement is either an axiom itself, or it can be deduced from the axioms by a finite number of applications of the deduction rules. We wish to define a set of numbers that represents all these provable statements. We define as the minimal set consisting of all numbers in (representing axioms) and closed under all the relations . This means that whenever is in the set and for some numbers and , the number is also in the set . It is not hard to see that represents the set of provable statements. That is, the members of are the Gödel numbers of the provable statements.\nA proof of a formula is itself a string of mathematical statements related by particular relations (each is either an axiom or related to former statements by deduction rules), where the last statement is . Thus one can define the Gödel number of a proof. Moreover, one may define a statement form , which for every two numbers and is provable if and only if is the Gödel number of a proof of the statement and .\n\nThe detailed construction of the formula makes essential use of the assumption that the theory is effective; it would not be possible to construct this formula without such an assumption.\n\nFor every number and every formula , where is a free variable, we define , a relation between two numbers and , such that it corresponds to the statement \" is not the Gödel number of a proof of \". Here, can be understood as with its own Gödel number as its argument.\n\nNote that takes as an argument , the Gödel number of . In order to prove either , or , it is necessary to perform number-theoretic operations on that mirror the following steps: decode the number into the formula , replace all occurrences of in with the number , and then compute the Gödel number of the resulting formula .\n\nNote that for every specific number and formula is a straightforward (though complicated) arithmetical relation between two numbers and , building on the relation defined earlier. Further, is provable if the finite list of formulas encoded by is not a proof of , and is provable if the finite list of formulas encoded by is a proof of . Given any numbers and , either or (but not both) is provable.\n\nAny proof of can be encoded by a Gödel number , such that does not hold. If holds for all natural numbers , then there is no proof of . In other words, , a formula about natural numbers, corresponds to \"there is no proof of \".\n\nWe now define the formula , where is a free variable. The formula itself has a Gödel number as does every formula.\n\nThis formula has a free variable . Suppose we replace it with ,\nthe Gödel number of a formula , where is a free variable. Then, corresponds to \"there is no proof of \", as we have seen.\n\nConsider the formula . This formula concerning the number corresponds to \"there is no proof of \". We have here the self-referential feature that is crucial to the proof: A formula of the formal theory that somehow relates to its own provability within that formal theory. Very informally, says: \"I am not provable\".\n\nWe will now show that neither the formula , nor its negation , is provable.\n\nSuppose is provable. Let be the Gödel number of a proof of . Then, as seen earlier, the formula is provable. Proving both and violates the consistency of the formal theory. We therefore conclude that is not provable.\n\nConsider any number . Suppose is provable.\nThen, must be the Gödel number of a proof of . But we have just proved that is not provable. Since either or must be provable, we conclude that, for all natural numbers is provable.\n\nSuppose the negation of , , is provable. Proving both , and , for all natural numbers , violates ω-consistency of the formal theory. Thus if the theory is ω-consistent, is not provable.\n\nWe have sketched a proof showing that:\n\nFor any formal, recursively enumerable (i.e. effectively generated) theory of Peano Arithmetic,\n\nThe proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem just sketched is proof-theoretic (also called syntactic) in that it shows that if certain proofs exist (a proof of or its negation) then they can be manipulated to produce a proof of a contradiction. This makes no appeal to whether is \"true\", only to whether it is provable. Truth is a model-theoretic, or semantic, concept, and is not equivalent to provability except in special cases.\n\nBy analyzing the situation of the above proof in more detail, it is possible to obtain a conclusion about the truth of in the standard model ℕ of natural numbers. As just seen, is provable for each natural number , and is thus true in the model ℕ. Therefore, within this model,\n\nholds. This is what the statement \" is true\" usually refers to—the sentence is true in the intended model. It is not true in every model, however: If it were, then by Gödel's completeness theorem it would be provable, which we have just seen is not the case.\n\nGeorge Boolos (1989) vastly simplified the proof of the First Theorem, if one agrees that the theorem is equivalent to:\n\n\"There is no algorithm whose output contains all true sentences of arithmetic and no false ones.\"\n\n\"Arithmetic\" refers to Peano or Robinson arithmetic, but the proof invokes no specifics of either, tacitly assuming that these systems allow '<' and '×' to have their usual meanings. Boolos proves the theorem in about two pages. His proof employs the language of first-order logic, but invokes no facts about the connectives or quantifiers. The domain of discourse is the natural numbers. The Gödel sentence builds on Berry's paradox.\n\nLet abbreviate successive applications of the successor function, starting from . Boolos then asserts (the details are only sketched) that there exists a defined predicate that comes out true iff an arithmetic formula containing symbols names the number . This proof sketch contains the only mention of Gödel numbering; Boolos merely assumes that every formula can be so numbered. Here, a formula \"names\" the number iff the following is provable:\n\nBoolos then defines the related predicates:\n\n\nThe above predicates contain the only existential quantifiers appearing in the entire proof. The '<' and '×' appearing in these predicates are the only defined arithmetical notions the proof requires. The proof nowhere mentions recursive functions or any facts from number theory, and Boolos claims that his proof dispenses with diagonalization. For more on this proof, see Berry's paradox.\n\n\n"}

Quantum ergodicity states, roughly, that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated to energy eigenstates of a quantized ergodic Hamiltonian tend to a uniform distribution in the classical phase space. This is consistent with the intuition that the flows of ergodic systems are equidistributed in phase space. By contrast, classical completely integrable systems generally have periodic orbits in phase space, and this is exhibited in a variety of ways in the high-energy limit of the eigenstates: typically that some form of concentration or \"scarring\" occurs in the limit.\n\nThe model case of a Hamiltonian is the geodesic Hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold. The quantization of the geodesic flow is given by the fundamental solution of the Schrödinger equation\nwhere formula_2 is the square root of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The quantum ergodicity theorem of Shnirelman, Yves Colin de Verdière, and Zelditch states that a compact Riemannian manifold whose unit tangent bundle is ergodic under the geodesic flow is also ergodic in the sense that the probability density associated to the \"n\"th eigenfunction of the Laplacian tends weakly to the uniform distribution on the unit cotangent bundle as \"n\" → ∞ in a subset of the natural numbers of natural density equal to one.

{"id": "5308894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5308894", "title": "Space (mathematics)", "text": "Space (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, a space is a set (sometimes called a universe) with some added structure.\n\nWhile modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as Euclidean spaces, linear spaces, topological spaces, Hilbert spaces, or probability spaces, it does not define the notion of \"space\" itself.\n\nA space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. \nThe nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. It is the relationships that define the nature of the space. More precisely, isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an isomorphism between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships. For example, the relationships between the points of a three-dimensional Euclidean space are uniquely determined by Euclid's axioms, and all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are considered identical.\n\nTopological notions such as continuity have natural definitions in every Euclidean space. \nHowever, topology does not distinguish straight lines from curved lines, and the relation between Euclidean and topological spaces is thus \"forgetful\". Relations of this kind are sketched in Figure 1, and treated in more detail in the Section \"Types of spaces\". \n\nIt is not always clear whether a given mathematical object should be considered as a geometric \"space\", or an algebraic \"structure\". A general definition of \"structure\", proposed by Bourbaki, embraces all common types of spaces, provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies the transfer of properties between isomorphic structures.\n\nIn ancient Greek mathematics, \"space\" was a geometric abstraction of the three-dimensional reality observed in everyday life. About 300 BC, Euclid gave axioms for the properties of space. Euclid built all of mathematics on these geometric foundations, going so far as to define numbers by comparing the lengths of line segments to the length of a chosen reference segment.\n\nThe method of coordinates (analytic geometry) was adopted by René Descartes in 1637. At that time, geometric theorems were treated as absolute objective truths knowable through intuition and reason, similar to objects of natural science; and axioms were treated as obvious implications of definitions.\n\nTwo equivalence relations between geometric figures were used: congruence and similarity. Translations, rotations and reflections transform a figure into congruent figures; homotheties — into similar figures. For example, all circles are mutually similar, but ellipses are not similar to circles. A third equivalence relation, introduced by Gaspard Monge in 1795, occurs in projective geometry: not only ellipses, but also parabolas and hyperbolas, turn into circles under appropriate projective transformations; they all are projectively equivalent figures.\n\nThe relation between the two geometries, Euclidean and projective, shows that mathematical objects are not given to us \"with their structure\". Rather, each mathematical theory describes its objects by \"some\" of their properties, precisely those that are put as axioms at the foundations of the theory.\n\nDistances and angles cannot appear in theorems of projective geometry, since these notions are neither mentioned in the axioms of projective geometry nor defined from the notions mentioned there. The question \"what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle\" is meaningful in Euclidean geometry but meaningless in projective geometry.\n\nA different situation appeared in the 19th century: in some geometries the sum of the three angles of a triangle is well-defined but different from the classical value (180 degrees). Non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, introduced by Nikolai Lobachevsky in 1829 and János Bolyai in 1832 (and Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1816, unpublished) stated that the sum depends on the triangle and is always less than 180 degrees. Eugenio Beltrami in 1868 and Felix Klein in 1871 obtained Euclidean \"models\" of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, and thereby completely justified this theory as a logical possibility.\n\nThis discovery forced the abandonment of the pretensions to the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry. It showed that axioms are not \"obvious\", nor \"implications of definitions\". Rather, they are hypotheses. To what extent do they correspond to an experimental reality? This important physical problem no longer has anything to do with mathematics. Even if a \"geometry\" does not correspond to an experimental reality, its theorems remain no less \"mathematical truths\".\n\nA Euclidean model of a non-Euclidean geometry is a choice of some objects existing in Euclidean space and some relations between these objects that satisfy all axioms (and therefore, all theorems) of the non-Euclidean geometry. These Euclidean objects and relations \"play\" the non-Euclidean geometry like contemporary actors playing an ancient performance. Actors can imitate a situation that never occurred in reality. Relations between the actors on the stage imitate relations between the characters in the play. Likewise, the chosen relations between the chosen objects of the Euclidean model imitate the non-Euclidean relations. It shows that relations between objects are essential in mathematics, while the nature of the objects is not.\n\nThe word \"geometry\" (from Ancient Greek: geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") initially meant a practical way of processing lengths, regions and volumes in the space in which we live, but was then extended widely (as well as the notion of space in question here).\n\nAccording to Bourbaki, the period between 1795 (\"Géométrie descriptive\" of Monge) and 1872 (the \"Erlangen programme\" of Klein) can be called the golden age of geometry. The original space investigated by Euclid is now called three-dimensional Euclidean space. Its axiomatization, started by Euclid 23 centuries ago, was reformed with Hilbert's axioms, Tarski's axioms and Birkhoff's axioms. These axiom systems describe the space via primitive notions (such as \"point\", \"between\", \"congruent\") constrained by a number of axioms.\n\nAnalytic geometry made great progress and succeeded in replacing theorems of classical geometry with computations via invariants of transformation groups. Since that time, new theorems of classical geometry have been of more interest to amateurs than to professional mathematicians. However, the heritage of classical geometry was not lost. According to Bourbaki, \"passed over in its role as an autonomous and living science, classical geometry is thus transfigured into a universal language of contemporary mathematics\".\n\nSimultaneously, numbers began to displace geometry as the foundation of mathematics. For instance, in Richard Dedekind's 1872 essay \"Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen\" (\"Continuity and irrational numbers\"), he asserts that points on a line ought to have the properties of Dedekind cuts, and that therefore a line was the same thing as the set of real numbers. Dedekind is careful to note that this is an assumption that is incapable of being proven. In modern treatments, Dedekind's assertion is often taken to be the definition of a line, thereby reducing geometry to arithmetic. Three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space whose associated vector space of differences of its elements is equipped with an inner product. A definition \"from scratch\", as in Euclid, is now not often used, since it does not reveal the relation of this space to other spaces. Also, a three-dimensional projective space is now defined as the space of all one-dimensional subspaces (that is, straight lines through the origin) of a four-dimensional vector space. This shift in foundations requires a new set of axioms, and if these axioms are adopted, the classical axioms of geometry become theorems.\n\nA space now consists of selected mathematical objects (for instance, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space, or just elements of a set) treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. Therefore, spaces are just mathematical structures of convenience. One may expect that the structures called \"spaces\" are perceived more geometrically than other mathematical objects, but this is not always true.\n\nAccording to the famous inaugural lecture given by Bernhard Riemann in 1854, every mathematical object parametrized by \"n\" real numbers may be treated as a point of the \"n\"-dimensional space of all such objects. Contemporary mathematicians follow this idea routinely and find it extremely suggestive to use the terminology of classical geometry nearly everywhere.\n\nFunctions are important mathematical objects. Usually they form infinite-dimensional function spaces, as noted already by Riemann and elaborated in the 20th century by functional analysis.\n\nWhile each type of spaces has its own definition, the general idea of \"space\" evades formalization. Some structures are called spaces, other are not, without a formal criterion. Moreover, there is no consensus on the general idea of \"structure\".\nAccording to Pudlák, \"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have.\"\nWe will return to Bourbaki's structuralist approach in the last section \"Spaces and structures\", while we now outline a possible classification of spaces (and structures) in the spirit of Bourbaki.\n\nWe classify spaces on three levels. Given that each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, the first question to ask is: which properties? This leads to the first (upper) classification level. On the second level, one takes into account answers to especially important questions (among the questions that make sense according to the first level). On the third level of classification, one takes into account answers to all possible questions.\n\nFor example, the \"upper-level classification\" distinguishes between Euclidean and projective spaces, since the distance between two points is defined in Euclidean spaces but undefined in projective spaces. \nAnother example. The question \"what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle\" makes sense in a Euclidean space but not in a projective space. In a non-Euclidean space the question makes sense but is answered differently, which is not an upper-level distinction.\n\nAlso, the distinction between a Euclidean plane and a Euclidean 3-dimensional space is not an upper-level distinction; the question \"what is the dimension\" makes sense in both cases.\n\nThe \"second-level classification\" distinguishes, for example, between Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces; between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces; between compact and non-compact spaces, etc.\nIn Bourbaki's terms, the second-level classification is the classification by \"species\". Unlike biological taxonomy, a space may belong to several species.\n\nThe \"third-level classification\" distinguishes, for example, between spaces of different dimension, but does not distinguish between a plane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and the set of all pairs of real numbers, also treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Likewise it does not distinguish between different Euclidean models of the same non-Euclidean space.\nMore formally, the third level classifies spaces up to isomorphism. An isomorphism between two spaces is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the first space and the points of the second space, that preserves all relations stipulated according to the first level. Mutually isomorphic spaces are thought of as copies of a single space. If one of them belongs to a given species then they all do.\n\nThe notion of isomorphism sheds light on the upper-level classification. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two spaces of the same upper-level class, one may ask whether it is an isomorphism or not. This question makes no sense for two spaces of different classes.\n\nAn isomorphism to itself is called an automorphism. Automorphisms of a Euclidean space are shifts, rotations, reflections and compositions of these. Euclidean space is homogeneous in the sense that every point can be transformed into every other point by some automorphism.\n\nEuclidean axioms leave no freedom; they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the space. More exactly: all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have \"the\" three-dimensional Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the corresponding theory is \"univalent\". In contrast, topological spaces are generally non-isomorphic; their theory is \"multivalent\". A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models of the same cardinality are mutually isomorphic. According to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.\n\nTopological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean space is also a topological space. Every isomorphism between two Euclidean spaces is also an isomorphism between the corresponding topological spaces (called \"homeomorphism\"), but the converse is wrong: a homeomorphism may distort distances. In Bourbaki's terms, \"topological space\" is an \"underlying\" structure of the \"Euclidean space\" structure. Similar ideas occur in category theory: the category of Euclidean spaces is a concrete category over the category of topological spaces; the forgetful (or \"stripping\") functor maps the former category to the latter category.\n\nA three-dimensional Euclidean space is a special case of a Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the species of three-dimensional Euclidean space is \"richer\" than the species of Euclidean space. Likewise, the species of compact topological space is richer than the species of topological space.\n\nSuch relations between species of spaces may be expressed diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3. An arrow from A to B means that every is also a or may be treated as a or provides a etc. Treating A and B as classes of spaces one may interpret the arrow as a transition from A to B. (In Bourbaki's terms, \"procedure of deduction\" of a from a Not quite a function unless the classes A,B are sets; this nuance does not invalidate the following.) The two arrows on Fig. 3 are not invertible, but for different reasons. \n\nThe transition from \"Euclidean\" to \"topological\" is forgetful. Topology distinguishes continuous from discontinuous, but does not distinguish rectilinear from curvilinear. Intuition tells us that the Euclidean structure cannot be restored from the topology. A proof uses an automorphism of the topological space (that is, self-homeomorphism) that is not an automorphism of the Euclidean space (that is, not a composition of shifts, rotations and reflections). Such transformation turns the given Euclidean structure into a (isomorphic but) different Euclidean structure; both Euclidean structures correspond to a single topological structure.\n\nIn contrast, the transition from \"3-dim Euclidean\" to \"Euclidean\" is not forgetful; a Euclidean space need not be 3-dimensional, but if it happens to be 3-dimensional, it is full-fledged, no structure is lost. In other words, the latter transition is injective (one-to-one), while the former transition is not injective (many-to-one). We denote injective transitions by an arrow with a barbed tail, \"↣\" rather than \"→\".\n\nBoth transitions are not surjective, that is, not every B-space results from some A-space. First, a 3-dim Euclidean space is a special (not general) case of a Euclidean space. Second, a topology of a Euclidean space is a special case of topology (for instance, it must be non-compact, and connected, etc). We denote surjective transitions by a two-headed arrow, \"↠\" rather than \"→\". See for example Fig. 4; there, the arrow from \"real linear topological\" to \"real linear\" is two-headed, since every real linear space admits some (at least one) topology compatible with its linear structure.\n\nSuch topology is non-unique in general, but unique when the real linear space is finite-dimensional. For these spaces the transition is both injective and surjective, that is, bijective; see the arrow from \"finite-dim real linear topological\" to \"finite-dim real linear\" on Fig. 4. The inverse transition exists (and could be shown by a second, backward arrow). The two species of structures are thus equivalent. In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures. Equivalent structures may be treated as a single structure, as shown by a large box on Fig. 4.\n\nThe transitions denoted by the arrows obey isomorphisms. That is, two isomorphic lead to two isomorphic .\n\nThe diagram on Fig. 4 is commutative. That is, all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Other diagrams below are also commutative, except for dashed arrows on Fig. 9. The arrow from \"topological\" to \"measurable\" is dashed for the reason explained there: \"In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a σ-algebra. The σ-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice.\" A solid arrow denotes a prevalent, so-called \"canonical\" transition that suggests itself naturally and is widely used, often implicitly, by default. For example, speaking about a continuous function on a Euclidean space, one need not specify its topology explicitly. In fact, alternative topologies exist and are used sometimes, for example, the fine topology; but these are always specified explicitly, since they are much less notable that the prevalent topology. A dashed arrow indicates that several transitions are in use and no one is quite prevalent.\n\nTwo basic spaces are linear spaces (also called vector spaces) and topological spaces.\n\nLinear spaces are of algebraic nature; there are real linear spaces (over the field of real numbers),\ncomplex linear spaces (over the field of complex numbers), and more generally, linear spaces over any field. Every complex linear space is also a real linear space (the latter \"underlies\" the former), since each real number is also a complex number.\nMore generally, a vector space over a field also has the structure of a vector space over a subfield of that field.\nLinear operations, given in a linear space by definition, lead to such notions as straight lines (and planes, and other linear subspaces); parallel lines; ellipses (and ellipsoids). However, it is impossible to define \northogonal (perpendicular) lines, or to single out circles among ellipses, because in a linear space \nthere is no structure like a scalar product that could be used for measuring angles. The dimension of a linear space is defined as the maximal number of linearly independent vectors or, equivalently, as the minimal number of vectors that span the space; it may be finite or infinite. Two linear spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same dimension. A complex linear space is also a real linear space.\n\nTopological spaces are of analytic nature. Open sets, given in a topological space by definition, lead to such notions as continuous functions, paths, maps; convergent sequences, limits; interior, boundary, exterior. However, uniform continuity, bounded sets, Cauchy sequences, differentiable functions (paths, maps) remain undefined. Isomorphisms between topological spaces are traditionally called homeomorphisms; these are one-to-one correspondences continuous in both directions. The open interval (0,1) is homeomorphic to the whole real line (-∞,∞) but not homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1], nor to a circle. The surface of a cube is homeomorphic to a sphere (the surface of a ball) but not homeomorphic to a torus. Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, which seems evident, but is not easy to prove. The dimension of a topological space is difficult to define; inductive dimension (based on the observation that the dimension of the boundary of a geometric figure is usually one less than the dimension of the figure itself) and Lebesgue covering dimension can be used. In the case of a Euclidean space, both topological dimensions are equal to \"n\".\n\nEvery subset of a topological space is itself a topological space (in contrast, only \"linear\" subsets of a linear space are linear spaces). Arbitrary topological spaces, investigated by general topology (called also point-set topology) are too diverse for a complete classification up to homeomorphism. Compact topological spaces are an important class of topological spaces (\"species\" of this \"type\"). Every continuous function is bounded on such space. The closed interval [0,1] and the extended real line [-∞,∞] are compact; the open interval (0,1) and the line (-∞,∞) are not. Geometric topology investigates manifolds (another \"species\" of this \"type\"); these are topological spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces (and satisfying a few extra conditions). Low-dimensional manifolds are completely classified up to homeomorphism.\n\nBoth the linear and topological structures underly the linear topological space (in other words, topological vector space) structure. A linear topological space is both a real or complex linear space and a topological space, such that the linear operations are continuous. So a linear space that is also topological is not in general a linear topological space. \n\nEvery finite-dimensional real or complex linear space is a linear topological space in the sense that it carries one and only one topology that makes it a linear topological space. The two structures, \"finite-dimensional real or complex linear space\" and \"finite-dimensional linear topological space\", are thus equivalent, that is, mutually underlying. Accordingly, every invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional linear topological space is a homeomorphism. The three notions of dimension (one algebraic and two topological) agree for finite-dimensional real linear spaces. In infinite-dimensional spaces, however, different topologies can conform to a given linear structure, and invertible linear transformations are generally not homeomorphisms.\n\nIt is convenient to introduce affine and projective spaces by means of linear spaces, as follows. A linear subspace of a linear space, being itself a linear space, is not homogeneous; it contains a special point, the origin. Shifting it by a vector external to it, one obtains a affine subspace. It is homogeneous. An affine space need not be included into a linear space, but is isomorphic to an affine subspace of a linear space. All affine spaces are mutually isomorphic. In the words of John Baez, \"an affine space is a vector space that's forgotten its origin\". In particular, every linear space is also an affine space.\n\nGiven an affine subspace \"A\" in a linear space \"L\", a straight line in \"A\" may be defined as the intersection of \"A\" with a linear subspace of \"L\" that intersects \"A\": in other words, with a plane through the origin that is not parallel to \"A\". More generally, a affine subspace of \"A\" is the intersection of \"A\" with a linear subspace of \"L\" that intersects \"A\".\n\nEvery point of the affine subspace \"A\" is the intersection of \"A\" with a linear subspace of \"L\". However, some subspaces of \"L\" are parallel to \"A\"; in some sense, they intersect \"A\" at infinity. The set of all linear subspaces of a linear space is, by definition, a projective space. And the affine subspace \"A\" is embedded into the projective space as a proper subset. However, the projective space itself is homogeneous. A straight line in the projective space corresponds to a linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space. More generally, a projective subspace of the projective space corresponds to a linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space, and is isomorphic to the projective space.\n\nDefined this way, affine and projective spaces are of algebraic nature; they can be real, complex, and more generally, over any field.\n\nEvery real or complex affine or projective space is also a topological space. An affine space is a non-compact manifold; a projective space is a compact manifold. In a real projective space a straight line is homeomorphic to a circle, therefore compact, in contrast to a straight line in a linear of affine space.\n\nDistances between points are defined in a metric space. Isomorphisms between metric spaces are called isometries. Every metric space is also a topological space. A topological space is called metrizable, if it underlies a metric space. All manifolds are metrizable.\n\nIn a metric space, we can define \nbounded sets and Cauchy sequences. A metric space is called complete if all Cauchy sequences converge. Every incomplete space is isometrically embedded, as a dense subset, into a complete space (the completion). Every compact metric space is complete; the real line is non-compact but complete; the open interval (0,1) is incomplete. \n\nEvery Euclidean space is also a complete metric space. Moreover, all geometric notions immanent to a Euclidean space can be characterized in terms of its metric. For example, the straight segment connecting two given points \"A\" and \"C\" consists of all points \"B\" such that the distance between \"A\" and \"C\" is equal to the sum of two distances, between \"A\" and \"B\" and between \"B\" and \"C\".\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension (related to the number of small balls that cover the given set) applies to metric spaces, and can be non-integer (especially for fractals). For a Euclidean space, the Hausdorff dimension is equal to \"n\".\n\nUniform spaces do not introduce distances, but still allow one to use uniform continuity, Cauchy sequences (or filters or nets), completeness and completion. Every uniform space is also a topological space. Every \"linear\" topological space (metrizable or not) is also a uniform space, and is complete in finite dimension but generally incomplete in infinite dimension. More generally, every commutative topological group is also a uniform space. A non-commutative topological group, however, carries two uniform structures, one left-invariant, the other right-invariant.\n\nVectors in a Euclidean space form a linear space, but each vector formula_1 has also a length, in other words, norm, formula_2. A real or complex linear space endowed with a norm is a normed space. Every normed space is both a linear topological space and a metric space. A Banach space is a complete normed space. Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.\n\nThe set of all vectors of norm less than one is called the unit ball of a normed space. It is a convex, centrally symmetric set, generally not an ellipsoid; for example, it may be a polygon (in the plane) or. more generally, a polytope (in arbitrary finite dimension). The parallelogram law (called also parallelogram identity) \ngenerally fails in normed spaces, but holds for vectors in Euclidean spaces, which follows from the fact that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, formula_4.\n\nAn inner product space is a real or complex linear space, endowed with a bilinear or respectively sesquilinear form, satisfying some conditions and called an inner product. Every inner product space is also a normed space. A normed space underlies an inner product space if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law, or equivalently, if its unit ball is an ellipsoid. Angles between vectors are defined in inner product spaces. A Hilbert space is defined as a complete inner product space. (Some authors insist that it must be complex, others admit also real Hilbert spaces.) Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hilbert spaces are very important for quantum theory.\n\nAll real inner product spaces are mutually isomorphic. One may say that the Euclidean space is the real inner product space that forgot its origin.\n\nSmooth manifolds are not called \"spaces\", but could be. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, and can be embedded into a finite-dimensional linear space. Smooth surfaces in a finite-dimensional linear space are smooth manifolds: for example, the surface of an ellipsoid is a smooth manifold, a polytope is not. Real or complex finite-dimensional linear, affine and projective spaces are also smooth manifolds.\n\nAt each one of its points, a smooth path in a smooth manifold has a tangent vector that belongs to the manifold's tangent space at this point. Tangent spaces to an smooth manifold are linear spaces. The differential of a smooth function on a smooth manifold provides a linear functional on the tangent space at each point. \n\nA Riemannian manifold, or Riemann space, is a smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with inner products satisfying some conditions. Euclidean spaces are also Riemann spaces. Smooth surfaces in Euclidean spaces are Riemann spaces. A hyperbolic space is also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has a length, and the length of the shortest curve between two points defines a distance, such that the Riemann space is a metric space. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.\n\nWaiving positivity of inner products on tangent spaces, one obtains pseudo-Riemann spaces, including the Lorentzian spaces that are very important for general relativity.\n\nWaiving distances and angles while retaining volumes (of geometric bodies) one reaches measure theory. Besides the volume, a measure generalizes the notions of area, length, mass (or charge) distribution, and also probability distribution, according to Andrey Kolmogorov's approach to probability theory.\n\nA \"geometric body\" of classical mathematics is much more regular than just a set of points. The boundary of the body is of zero volume. Thus, the volume of the body is the volume of its interior, and the interior can be exhausted by an infinite sequence of cubes. In contrast, the boundary of an arbitrary set of points can be of non-zero volume (an example: the set of all rational points inside a given cube). Measure theory succeeded in extending the notion of volume to a vast class of sets, the so-called measurable sets. Indeed, non-measurable sets almost never occur in applications.\n\nMeasurable sets, given in a measurable space by definition, lead to measurable functions and maps. In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a The of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice. (Baire sets, universally measurable sets, etc, are also used sometimes.) \nThe topology is not uniquely determined by the Borel for example, the norm topology and the weak topology on a separable Hilbert space lead to the same Borel .\nNot every is the Borel of some topology.\nActually, a can be generated by a given collection of sets (or functions) irrespective of any topology. Every subset of a measurable space is itself a measurable space.\n\nStandard measurable spaces (also called standard Borel spaces) are especially useful due to some similarity to compact spaces (see EoM). Every bijective measurable mapping between standard measurable spaces is an isomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable. And a mapping between such spaces is measurable if and only if its graph is measurable in the product space. Similarly, every bijective continuous mapping between compact metric spaces is a homeomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also continuous. And a mapping between such spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed in the product space.\n\nEvery Borel set in a Euclidean space (and more generally, in a complete separable metric space), endowed with the Borel is a standard measurable space. All uncountable standard measurable spaces are mutually isomorphic.\n\nA measure space is a measurable space endowed with a measure. A Euclidean space with the Lebesgue measure is a measure space. Integration theory defines integrability and integrals of measurable functions on a measure space.\n\nSets of measure 0, called null sets, are negligible. Accordingly, a \"mod 0 isomorphism\" is defined as isomorphism between subsets of full measure (that is, with negligible complement).\n\nA probability space is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to 1. The product of any family (finite or not) of probability spaces is a probability space. In contrast, for measure spaces in general, only the product of finitely many spaces is defined. Accordingly, there are many infinite-dimensional probability measures (especially, Gaussian measures), but no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures.\n\nStandard probability spaces are especially useful. On a standard probability space a conditional expectation may be treated as the integral over the conditional measure (regular conditional probabilities, see also disintegration of measure). Given two standard probability spaces, every homomorphism of their measure algebras is induced by some measure preserving map. Every probability measure on a standard measurable space leads to a standard probability space. The product of a sequence (finite or not) of standard probability spaces is a standard probability space. All non-atomic standard probability spaces are mutually isomorphic mod 0; one of them is the interval (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure.\n\nThese spaces are less geometric. In particular, the idea of dimension, applicable (in one form or another) to all other spaces, does not apply to measurable, measure and probability spaces.\n\nThe theoretical study of calculus, known as mathematical analysis, led in the early 20th century to the consideration of linear spaces of real-valued or complex-valued functions. The earliest examples of these were function spaces, each one adapted to its own class of problems. These examples shared many common features, and these features were soon abstracted into Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and more general topological vector spaces. These were a powerful toolkit for the solution of a wide range of mathematical problems.\n\nThe most detailed information was carried by a class of spaces called Banach algebras. These are Banach spaces together with a continuous multiplication operation. An important early example was the Banach algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions on a measure space \"X\". This set of functions is a Banach space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. With the operation of pointwise multiplication, it becomes a special type of Banach space, one now called a commutative von Neumann algebra. Pointwise multiplication determines a representation of this algebra on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on \"X\". An early observation of John von Neumann was that this correspondence also worked in reverse: Given some mild technical hypotheses, a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a representation on a Hilbert space determines a measure space, and these two constructions (of a von Neumann algebra plus a representation and of a measure space) are mutually inverse.\n\nVon Neumann then proposed that non-commutative von Neumann algebras should have geometric meaning, just as commutative von Neumann algebras do. Together with Francis Murray, he produced a classification of von Neumann algebras. The direct integral construction shows how to break any von Neumann algebra into a collection of simpler algebras called \"factors\". Von Neumann and Murray classified factors into three types. Type I was nearly identical to the commutative case. Types II and III exhibited new phenomena. A type II von Neumann algebra determined a geometry with the peculiar feature that the dimension could be any non-negative real number, not just an integer. Type III algebras were those that were neither types I nor II, and after several decades of effort, these were proven to be closely related to type II factors.\n\nA slightly different approach to the geometry of function spaces developed at the same time as von Neumann and Murray's work on the classification of factors. This approach is the theory of Here, the motivating example is the formula_5, where \"X\" is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space. By definition, this is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on \"X\" that vanish at infinity (which loosely means that the farther you go from a chosen point, the closer the function gets to zero) with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication. The Gelfand–Naimark theorem implied that there is a correspondence between commutative and geometric objects: Every commutative is of the form formula_5 for some locally compact Hausdorff space \"X\". Consequently it is possible to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces purely in terms of commutative Non-commutative geometry takes this as inspiration for the study of non-commutative If there were such a thing as a \"non-commutative space \"X\",\" then its formula_5 would be a non-commutative ; if in addition the Gelfand–Naimark theorem applied to these non-existent objects, then spaces (commutative or not) would be the same as so, for lack of a direct approach to the definition of a non-commutative space, a non-commutative space is \"defined\" to be a non-commutative Many standard geometric tools can be restated in terms of and this gives geometrically-inspired techniques for studying non-commutative .\n\nBoth of these examples are now cases of a field called non-commutative geometry. The specific examples of von Neumann algebras and are known as non-commutative measure theory and non-commutative topology, respectively. Non-commutative geometry is not merely a pursuit of generality for its own sake and is not just a curiosity. Non-commutative spaces arise naturally, even inevitably, from some constructions. For example, consider the non-periodic Penrose tilings of the plane by kites and darts. It is a theorem that, in such a tiling, every finite patch of kites and darts appears infinitely often. As a consequence, there is no way to distinguish two Penrose tilings by looking at a finite portion. This makes it impossible to assign the set of all tilings a topology in the traditional sense. Despite this, the Penrose tilings determine a non-commutative and consequently they can be studied by the techniques of non-commutative geometry. Another example, and one of great interest within differential geometry, comes from foliations of manifolds. These are ways of splitting the manifold up into smaller-dimensional submanifolds called \"leaves\", each of which is locally parallel to others nearby. The set of all leaves can be made into a topological space. However, the example of an irrational rotation shows that this topological space can be inacessible to the techniques of classical measure theory. However, there is a non-commutative von Neumann algebra associated to the leaf space of a foliation, and once again, this gives an otherwise unintelligible space a good geometric structure.\n\nAlgebraic geometry studies the geometric properties of polynomial equations. Polynomials are a type of function defined from the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. Because of this, they are closely tied to algebra. Algebraic geometry offers a way to apply geometric techniques to questions of pure algebra, and vice versa.\n\nPrior to the 1940s, algebraic geometry worked exclusively over the complex numbers, and the most fundamental variety was projective space. The geometry of projective space is closely related to the theory of perspective, and its algebra is described by homogeneous polynomials. All other varieties were defined as subsets of projective space. Projective varieties were subsets defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials. At each point of the projective variety, all the polynomials in the set were required to equal zero. The complement of the zero set of a linear polynomial is an affine space, and an affine variety was the intersection of a projective variety with an affine space.\n\nAndré Weil saw that geometric reasoning could sometimes be applied in number-theoretic situations where the spaces in question might be discrete or even finite. In pursuit of this idea, Weil rewrote the foundations of algebraic geometry, both freeing algebraic geometry from its reliance on complex numbers and introducing \"abstract algebraic varieties\" which were not embedded in projective space. These are now simply called \"varieties\".\n\nThe type of space that underlies most modern algebraic geometry is even more general than Weil's abstract algebraic varieties. It was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck and is called a scheme. One of the motivations for scheme theory is that polynomials are unusually structured among functions, and algebraic varieties are consequently rigid. This presents problems when attempting to study degenerate situations. For example, almost any pair of points on a circle determines a unique line called the secant line, and as the two points move around the circle, the secant line varies continuously. However, when the two points collide, the secant line degenerates to a tangent line. The tangent line is unique, but the geometry of this configuration—a single point on a circle—is not expressive enough to determine a unique line. Studying situations like this requires a theory capable of assigning extra data to degenerate situations.\n\nOne of the building blocks of a scheme is a topological space. Topological spaces have continuous functions, but continuous functions are too general to reflect the underlying algebraic structure of interest. The other ingredient in a scheme, therefore, is a sheaf on the topological space, called the \"structure sheaf\". On each open subset of the topological space, the sheaf specifies a collection of functions, called \"regular functions\". The topological space and the structure sheaf together are required to satisfy conditions that mean the functions come from algebraic operations.\n\nLike manifolds, schemes are defined as spaces that are locally modeled on a familiar space. In the case of manifolds, the familiar space is Euclidean space. For a scheme, the local models are called affine schemes. Affine schemes provide a direct link between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The fundamental objects of study in commutative algebra are commutative rings. If formula_8 is a commutative ring, then there is a corresponding affine scheme formula_9 which translates the algebraic structure of formula_8 into geometry. Conversely, every affine scheme determines a commutative ring, namely, the ring of global sections of its structure sheaf. These two operations are mutually inverse, so affine schemes provide a new language with which to study questions in commutative algebra. By definition, every point in a scheme has an open neighborhood which is an affine scheme.\n\nThere are many schemes that are not affine. In particular, projective spaces satisfy a condition called properness which is analogous to compactness. Affine schemes cannot be proper (except in trivial situations like when the scheme has only a single point), and hence no projective space is an affine scheme (except for zero-dimensional projective spaces). Projective schemes, meaning those that arise as closed subschemes of a projective space, are the single most important family of schemes.\n\nSeveral generalizations of schemes have been introduced. Michael Artin defined an algebraic space as the quotient of a scheme by the equivalence relations that define étale morphisms. Algebraic spaces retain many of the useful properties of schemes while simultaneously being more flexible. For instance, the Keel–Mori theorem can be used to show that many moduli spaces are algebraic spaces.\n\nMore general than an algebraic space is a Deligne–Mumford stack. DM stacks are similar to schemes, but they permit singularities that cannot be described solely in terms of polynomials. They play the same role for schemes that orbifolds do for manifolds. For example, the quotient of the affine plane by a finite group of rotations around the origin yields a Deligne–Mumford stack that is not a scheme or an algebraic space. Away from the origin, the quotient by the group action identifies finite sets of equally spaced points on a circle. But at the origin, the circle consists of only a single point, the origin itself, and the group action fixes this point. In the quotient DM stack, however, this point comes with the extra data of being a quotient. This kind of refined structure is useful in the theory of moduli spaces, and in fact, it was originally introduced to describe moduli of algebraic curves.\n\nA further generalization are the algebraic stacks, also called Artin stacks. DM stacks are limited to quotients by finite group actions. While this suffices for many problems in moduli theory, it is too restrictive for others, and Artin stacks permit more general quotients.\n\nIn Grothendieck's work on the Weil conjectures, he introduced a new type of topology now called a Grothendieck topology. A topological space (in the ordinary sense) axiomatizes the notion of \"nearness,\" making two points be nearby if and only if they lie in many of the same open sets. By contrast, a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the notion of \"covering\". A covering of a space is a collection of subspaces that jointly contain all the information of the ambient space. Since sheaves are defined in terms of coverings, a Grothendieck topology can also be seen as an axiomatization of the theory of sheaves.\n\nGrothendieck's work on his topologies led him to the theory of topoi. In his memoir \"Récoltes et Semailles\", he called them his \"most vast conception\". A sheaf (either on a topological space or with respect to a Grothendieck topology) is used to express local data. The category of all sheaves carries all possible ways of expressing local data. Since topological spaces are constructed from points, which are themselves a kind of local data, the category of sheaves can therefore be used as a replacement for the original space. Grothendieck consequently defined a topos to be a category of sheaves and studied topoi as objects of interest in their own right. These are now called Grothendieck topoi.\n\nEvery topological space determines a topos, and vice versa. There are topological spaces where taking the associated topos loses information, but these are generally considered pathological. (A necessary and sufficient condition is that the topological space be a sober space.) Conversely, there are topoi whose associated topological spaces do not capture the original topos. But, far from being pathological, these topoi can be of great mathematical interest. For instance, Grothendieck's theory of étale cohomology (which eventually led to the proof of the Weil conjectures) can be phrased as cohomology in the étale topos of a scheme, and this topos does not come from a topological space.\n\nTopological spaces in fact lead to very special topoi called locales. The set of open subsets of a topological space determines a lattice. The axioms for a topological space cause these lattices to be complete Heyting algebras. The theory of locales takes this as its starting point. A locale is defined to be a complete Heyting algebra, and the elementary properties of topological spaces are re-expressed and reproved in these terms. The concept of a locale turns out to be more general than a topological space, in that every sober topological space determines a unique locale, but many interesting locales do not come from topological spaces. Because locales need not have points, the study of locales is somewhat jokingly called pointless topology.\n\nTopoi also display deep connections to mathematical logic. Every Grothendieck topos has a special sheaf called a subobject classifier. This subobject classifier functions like the set of all possible truth values. In the topos of sets, the subobject classifier is the set formula_11, corresponding to \"False\" and \"True\". But in other topoi, the subobject classifier can be much more complicated. Lawvere and Tierney recognized that axiomatizing the subobject classifier yielded a more general kind of topos, now known as an elementary topos, and that elementary topoi were models of intuitionistic logic. In addition to providing a powerful way to apply tools from logic to geometry, this made possible the use of geometric methods in logic.\n\nAccording to Kevin Carlson,\n\nNevertheless, a general definition of \"structure\" was proposed by Bourbaki; it embraces all types of spaces mentioned above, (nearly?) all types of mathematical structures used till now, and more. It provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies transfer of properties between isomorphic structures. However, it was never used actively in mathematical practice (not even in the mathematical treatises written by Bourbaki himself). Here are the last phrases from a review by Robert Reed of a book by Leo Corry:\n\nFor more information on mathematical structures see Wikipedia: mathematical structure, equivalent definitions of mathematical structures, and transport of structure.\n\nThe distinction between geometric \"spaces\" and algebraic \"structures\" is sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, groups are algebraic, while Euclidean spaces are geometric. Modules over rings are as algebraic as groups. In particular, when the ring appears to be a field, the module appears to be a linear space; is it algebraic or geometric? In particular, when it is finite-dimensional, over real numbers, and endowed with inner product, it becomes Euclidean space; now geometric. The (algebraic?) field of real numbers is the same as the (geometric?) real line. Its algebraic closure, the (algebraic?) field of complex numbers, is the same as the (geometric?) complex plane. It is first of all \"a place we do analysis\" (rather than algebra or geometry).\n\nEvery space treated in Section \"Types of spaces\" above, except for \"Non-commutative geometry\", \"Schemes\" and \"Topoi\" subsections, is a set (the \"principal base set\" of the structure, according to Bourbaki) endowed with some additional structure; elements of the base set are usually called \"points\" of this space. In contrast, elements of (the base set of) an algebraic structure usually are not called \"points\".\n\nHowever, sometimes one uses more than one principal base set. For example, two-dimensional projective geometry may be formalized via two base sets, the set of points and the set of lines. Moreover, a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the roles played by points and lines. A less geometric example: a graph may be formalized via two base sets, the set of vertices (called also nodes or points) and the set of edges (called also arcs or lines). Generally, finitely many principal base sets and finitely many auxiliary base sets are stipulated by Bourbaki.\n\nMany mathematical structures of geometric flavor treated in the \"Non-commutative geometry\", \"Schemes\" and \"Topoi\" subsections above do not stipulate a base set of points. For example, \"pointless topology\" (in other words, point-free topology, or locale theory) starts with a single base set whose elements imitate open sets in a topological space (but are not sets of points); see also mereotopology and point-free geometry.\n\n\n"}

A simple example of univariate data would be the salaries of workers in industry. Like all the other data, univariate data can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools after the data is measured, collected, reported, and analyzed.\n\nSome univariate data consists of numbers (such as the height of 65 inches or the weight of 100 pounds), while others are nonnumerical (such as eye colors of brown or blue). Generally, the terms categorical univariate data and numerical univariate data are used to distinguish between these types.\n\nCategorical univariate data consist non-numerical observations that may be placed in categories. It includes labels or names used to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical univariate data usually use either nominal or ordinal scale of measurement.\n\nNumerical univariate data consist observations that are numbers. They are obtained using either interval or ratio scale of measurement. This type of univariate data can be classified even further into two subcategories: discrete and continuous. A numerical univariate data is discrete if the set of all possible values is finite or countably infinite. Discrete univariate data are usually associated with counting (such as the number of books read by a person). A numerical univariate data is continuous if the set of all possible values is an interval of numbers. Continuous univariate data are usually associated with measuring (such as the weights of people).\n\nUnivariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. Uni means one, so in other words the data has only one variable. Univariate data requires to analyze each variable separately. Data is gathered for the purpose of answering a question, or more specifically, a research question. Univariate data does not answer research questions about relationships between variables, but rather it is used to describe one characteristic or attribute that varies from observation to observation. Usually there are two purposes that a researcher can look for. The first one is to answer a research question with descriptive study and the second one is to get knowledge about how attribute varies with individual effect of a variable in Regression analysis. There are some ways to describe patterns found in univariate data which include graphical methods, measures of central tendency and measures of variability.\n\nThe most frequently used graphical illustrations for univariate data are:\n\nFrequency is how many times a number occurs. The frequency of an observation in statistics tells us the number of times the observation occurs in the data. For example, in the following list of numbers {\"1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 9, 8, 5, 1, 1, 9, 9, 0, 6, 9\"}, the frequency of the number 9 is 5 (because it occurs 5 times).\n\nBar chart is a graph consisting of rectangular bars. There bars actually represents number or percentage of observations of existing categories in a variable. The length or height of bars gives a visual representation of the proportional differences among categories.\n\nHistograms are used to estimate distribution of the data, with the frequency of values assigned to a value range called a bin.\n\nPie chart is a circle divided into portions that represent the relative frequencies or percentages of a population or a sample belonging to different categories.\n\nCentral tendency is one of the most common numerical descriptive measures. It's used to estimate the central location of the univariate data by the calculation of mean, median and mode. Each of these calculation has its own advantages and limitations.The mean has the advantage that its calculation includes each value of the data set, but it is particularly susceptible to the influence of outliers. The median is a better measure when the data set contains outliers. The mode is simple to locate. The important thing is that it's not restricted to using only one of these measure of central tendency. If the data being analyzed is categorical, then the only measure of central tendency that can be used is the mode. However, if the data is numerical in nature (ordinal or interval/ratio) then the mode, median, or mean can all be used to describe the data. Using more than one of these measures provides a more accurate descriptive summary of central tendency for the univariate.\n\nA measure of variability or dispersion (deviation from the mean) of a univariate data set can reveal the shape of a univariate data distribution more sufficiently. It will provide some information about the variation among data values. The measures of variability together with the measures of central tendency give a better picture of the data than the measures of central tendency alone. The three most frequently used measures of variability are range, variance and standard deviation. The appropriateness of each measure would depend on the type of data, the shape of the distribution of data and which measure of central tendency are being used. If the data is categorical, then there is no measure of variability to report. For data that is numerical, all three measures are possible. If the distribution of data is symmetrical, then the measures of variability are usually the variance and standard deviation. However, if the data are skewed, then the measure of variability that would be appropriate for that data set is the range.\n\nUnivariate distribution is a dispersal type of a single random variable described either with a probability mass function (pmf) for discrete probability distribution, or probability density function (pdf) for continuous probability distribution. It is not to be confused with multivariate distribution.\n\nUniform distribution (discrete) <br>\nBernoulli distribution <br>\nBinomial distribution <br>\nGeometric distribution <br>\nNegative binomial distribution <br>\nPoisson distribution <br>\nHypergeometric distribution <br>\nZeta distribution\n\nUniform distribution (continuous) <br>\nNormal distribution <br>\nGamma distribution <br>\nExponential distribution <br>\nWeibull distribution <br>\nCauchy distribution <br>\nBeta distribution\n\n"}

{"id": "3691548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3691548", "title": "Wythoff symbol", "text": "Wythoff symbol\n\nIn geometry, the Wythoff symbol represents a Wythoff construction of a uniform polyhedron or plane tiling, from a Schwarz triangle. It was first used by Coxeter, Longuet-Higgins and Miller in their enumeration of the uniform polyhedra.\n\nA Wythoff symbol consists of three numbers and a vertical bar. It represents one uniform polyhedron or tiling, although the same tiling/polyhedron can have different Wythoff symbols from different symmetry generators. For example, the regular cube can be represented by formula_1 with O symmetry, and formula_2 as a square prism with 2 colors and D symmetry, as well as formula_3 with 3 colors and formula_4 symmetry.\n\nWith a slight extension, Wythoff's symbol can be applied to all uniform polyhedra. However, the construction methods do not lead to all uniform tilings in Euclidean or hyperbolic space.\n\nIn three dimensions, Wythoff's construction begins by choosing a \"generator point\" on the triangle. If the distance of this point from each of the sides is non-zero, the point must be chosen to be an equal distance from each edge. A perpendicular line is then dropped between the generator point and every face that it does not lie on.\n\nThe three numbers in Wythoff's symbol, formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7, represent the corners of the Schwarz triangle used in the construction, which are formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 radians respectively. The triangle is also represented with the same numbers, written formula_11. The vertical bar in the symbol specifies a categorical position of the generator point within the fundamental triangle according to the following:\nIn this notation the mirrors are labeled by the reflection-order of the opposite vertex. The formula_18 values are listed \"before\" the bar if the corresponding mirror is active.\n\nThe one \"impossible\" symbol formula_19 implies the generator point is on all mirrors, which is only possible if the triangle is degenerate, reduced to a point. This unused symbol is therefore arbitrarily reassigned to represent the case where all mirrors are active, but odd-numbered reflected images are ignored. The resulting figure has rotational symmetry only.\n\nThe generator point can either be on or off each mirror, activated or not. This distinction creates 8 (2³) possible forms, neglecting one where the generator point is on all the mirrors.\n\nThe Wythoff symbol is functionally similar to the more general Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, in which each node represents a mirror and the arcs between them – marked with numbers – the angles between the mirrors. (An arc representing a right angle is omitted.) A node is circled if the generator point is not on the mirror.\n\nThere are seven generator points with each set of formula_18 (and a few special forms):\nThere are three special cases:\n\nThere are 4 symmetry classes of reflection on the sphere, and three in the Euclidean plane. A few of the infinitely many such patterns in the hyperbolic plane are also listed. (Increasing any of the numbers defining a hyperbolic or Euclidean tiling makes another hyperbolic tiling.)\n\nPoint groups:\nEuclidean (affine) groups:\nHyperbolic groups:\n\nThe above symmetry groups only include the integer solutions on the sphere. The list of Schwarz triangles includes rational numbers, and determine the full set of solutions of nonconvex uniform polyhedra.\n\nIn the tilings above, each triangle is a fundamental domain, colored by even and odd reflections.\n\nSelected tilings created by the Wythoff construction are given below.\n\nTilings are shown as polyhedra. Some of the forms are degenerate, given with brackets for vertex figures, with overlapping edges or vertices.\n\nSpherical tilings with dihedral symmetry exist for all formula_28 many with digon faces which become degenerate polyhedra. Two of the eight forms (Rectified and cantillated) are replications and are skipped in the table.\n\nSome representative hyperbolic tilings are given, and shown as a Poincaré disk projection.\n\nThe Coxeter–Dynkin diagram is given in a linear form, although it is actually a triangle, with the trailing segment r connecting to the first node.\n\n\n\n"}
