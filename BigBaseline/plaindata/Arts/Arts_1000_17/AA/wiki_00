Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts, which was practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Thomas Couture, and Hans Makart. In this context it is often called \"academism\", \"academicism\", \"art pompier\" (pejoratively), and \"eclecticism\", and sometimes linked with \"historicism\" and \"syncretism\".\n\nThe first academy of art was founded in Florence in Italy by Cosimo I de' Medici, on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect Giorgio Vasari who called it the \"Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno\" (Academy and Company for the Arts of Drawing) as it was divided in two different operative branches. While the Company was a kind of corporation which every working artist in Tuscany could join, the Academy comprised only the most eminent artistic personalities of Cosimo's court, and had the task of supervising the whole artistic production of the medicean state. In this medicean institution students learned the \"arti del disegno\" (a term coined by Vasari) and heard lectures on anatomy and geometry. Another academy, the Accademia di San Luca (named after the patron saint of painters, St. Luke), was founded about a decade later in Rome. The Accademia di San Luca served an educational function and was more concerned with art theory than the Florentine one. In 1582 Annibale Carracci opened his very influential \"Academy of Desiderosi\" in Bologna without official support; in some ways this was more like a traditional artist's workshop, but that he felt the need to label it as an \"academy\" demonstrates the attraction of the idea at the time.\n\nAccademia di San Luca later served as the model for the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture founded in France in 1648, and which later became the Académie des beaux-arts. The Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was founded in an effort to distinguish artists \"who were gentlemen practicing a liberal art\" from craftsmen, who were engaged in manual labor. This emphasis on the intellectual component of artmaking had a considerable impact on the subjects and styles of academic art.\n\nAfter the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was reorganized in 1661 by Louis XIV whose aim was to control all the artistic activity in France, a controversy occurred among the members that dominated artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This \"battle of styles\" was a conflict over whether Peter Paul Rubens or Nicolas Poussin was a suitable model to follow. Followers of Poussin, called \"poussinistes\", argued that line (disegno) should dominate art, because of its appeal to the intellect, while followers of Rubens, called \"rubenistes\", argued that color (colore) should dominate art, because of its appeal to emotion.\n\nThe debate was revived in the early 19th century, under the movements of Neoclassicism typified by the artwork of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and Romanticism typified by the artwork of Eugène Delacroix. Debates also occurred over whether it was better to learn art by looking at nature, or to learn by looking at the artistic masters of the past.\n\nAcademies using the French model formed throughout Europe, and imitated the teachings and styles of the French Académie. In England, this was the Royal Academy. The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts founded in 1754, may be taken as a successful example in a smaller country, which achieved its aim of producing a national school and reducing the reliance on imported artists. The painters of the Danish Golden Age of roughly 1800-1850 were nearly all trained there, and many returned to teach and the history of the art of Denmark is much less marked by tension between academic art and other styles than is the case in other countries.\n\nOne effect of the move to academies was to make training more difficult for women artists, who were excluded from most academies until the last half of the 19th century (1861 for the Royal Academy). This was partly because of concerns over the impropriety presented by nudity. Special arrangements were often made for female students until the 20th century.\n\nSince the onset of the poussiniste-rubeniste debate, many artists worked between the two styles. In the 19th century, in the revived form of the debate, the attention and the aims of the art world became to synthesize the line of Neoclassicism with the color of Romanticism. One artist after another was claimed by critics to have achieved the synthesis, among them Théodore Chassériau, Ary Scheffer, Francesco Hayez, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and Thomas Couture. William-Adolphe Bouguereau, a later academic artist, commented that the trick to being a good painter is seeing \"color and line as the same thing\".\nThomas Couture promoted the same idea in a book he authored on art method — arguing that whenever one said a painting had better color or better line it was nonsense, because whenever color appeared brilliant it depended on line to convey it, and vice versa; and that color was really a way to talk about the \"value\" of form.\n\nAnother development during this period included adopting historical styles in order to show the era in history that the painting depicted, called historicism. This is best seen in the work of Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, a later influence on James Tissot. It's also seen in the development of the Neo-Grec style. Historicism is also meant to refer to the belief and practice associated with academic art that one should incorporate and conciliate the innovations of different traditions of art from the past.\nThe art world also grew to give increasing focus on allegory in art. Theories of the importance of both line and color asserted that through these elements an artist exerts control over the medium to create psychological effects, in which themes, emotions, and ideas can be represented. As artists attempted to synthesize these theories in practice, the attention on the artwork as an allegorical or figurative vehicle was emphasized. It was held that the representations in painting and sculpture should evoke Platonic forms, or ideals, where behind ordinary depictions one would glimpse something abstract, some eternal truth. Hence, Keats' famous musing \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty\". The paintings were desired to be an \"idée\", a full and complete idea. Bouguereau is known to have said that he wouldn't paint \"a war\", but would paint \"War\". Many paintings by academic artists are simple nature allegories with titles like \"Dawn\", \"Dusk\", \"Seeing\", and \"Tasting\", where these ideas are personified by a single nude figure, composed in such a way as to bring out the essence of the idea.\n\nThe trend in art was also towards greater idealism, which is contrary to realism, in that the figures depicted were made simpler and more abstract—idealized—in order to be able to represent the ideals they stood in for. This would involve both generalizing forms seen in nature, and subordinating them to the unity and theme of the artwork.\n\nBecause history and mythology were considered as plays or dialectics of ideas, a fertile ground for important allegory, using themes from these subjects was considered the most serious form of painting. A hierarchy of genres, originally created in the 17th century, was valued, where history painting—classical, religious, mythological, literary, and allegorical subjects—was placed at the top, next genre painting, then portraiture, still-life, and landscape. History painting was also known as the \"grande genre\". Paintings of Hans Makart are often larger than life historical dramas, and he combined this with a historicism in decoration to dominate the style of 19th century Vienna culture. Paul Delaroche is a typifying example of French history painting.\n\nAll of these trends were influenced by the theories of the philosopher Hegel, who held that history was a dialectic of competing ideas, which eventually resolved in synthesis.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, academic art had saturated European society. Exhibitions were held often, and the most popular exhibition was the Paris Salon and beginning in 1903, the Salon d'Automne. These salons were sensational events that attracted crowds of visitors, both native and foreign. As much a social affair as an artistic one, 50,000 people might visit on a single Sunday, and as many as 500,000 could see the exhibition during its two-month run. Thousands of pictures were displayed, hung from just below eye level all the way up to the ceiling in a manner now known as \"Salon style\". A successful showing at the salon was a seal of approval for an artist, making his work saleable to the growing ranks of private collectors. Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel and Jean-Léon Gérôme were leading figures of this art world.\n\nDuring the reign of academic art, the paintings of the Rococo era, previously held in low favor, were revived to popularity, and themes often used in Rococo art such as Eros and Psyche were popular again. The academic art world also idolized Raphael, for the ideality of his work, in fact preferring him over Michelangelo.\n\nAcademic Art in Poland flourished under Jan Matejko, who established the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts. Many of these works can be seen in the\nGallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice in Kraków.\n\nAcademic art not only held influence in Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other Western countries. This was especially true for Latin American nations, which, because their revolutions were modeled on the French Revolution, sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is Ángel Zárraga of Mexico.\n\nYoung artists spent four years in rigorous training. In France, only students who passed an exam and carried a letter of reference from a noted professor of art were accepted at the academy's school, the École des Beaux-Arts. Drawings and paintings of the nude, called \"académies\", were the basic building blocks of academic art and the procedure for learning to make them was clearly defined. First, students copied prints after classical sculptures, becoming familiar with the principles of contour, light, and shade. The copy was believed crucial to the academic education; from copying works of past artists one would assimilate their methods of art making. To advance to the next step, and every successive one, students presented drawings for evaluation.\n\nIf approved, they would then draw from plaster casts of famous classical sculptures. Only after acquiring these skills were artists permitted entrance to classes in which a live model posed. Painting was not taught at the École des Beaux-Arts until after 1863. To learn to paint with a brush, the student first had to demonstrate proficiency in drawing, which was considered the foundation of academic painting. Only then could the pupil join the studio of an academician and learn how to paint. Throughout the entire process, competitions with a predetermined subject and a specific allotted period of time measured each students' progress.\n\nThe most famous art competition for students was the Prix de Rome. The winner of the Prix de Rome was awarded a fellowship to study at the Académie française's school at the Villa Medici in Rome for up to five years. To compete, an artist had to be of French nationality, male, under 30 years of age, and single. He had to have met the entrance requirements of the École and have the support of a well-known art teacher. The competition was grueling, involving several stages before the final one, in which 10 competitors were sequestered in studios for 72 days to paint their final history paintings. The winner was essentially assured a successful professional career.\n\nAs noted, a successful showing at the Salon was a seal of approval for an artist. Artists petitioned the hanging committee for optimal placement \"on the line,\" or at eye level. After the exhibition opened, artists complained if their works were \"skyed,\" or hung too high. The ultimate achievement for the professional artist was election to membership in the Académie française and the right to be known as an academician.\n\nAcademic art was first criticized for its use of idealism, by Realist artists such as Gustave Courbet, as being based on idealistic clichés and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being ignored. Another criticism by Realists was the \"false surface\" of paintings—the objects depicted looked smooth, slick, and idealized—showing no real texture. The Realist Théodule Ribot worked against this by experimenting with rough, unfinished textures in his painting.\n\nStylistically, the Impressionists, who advocated quickly painting outdoors exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts down, criticized the finished and idealized painting style. Although academic painters began a painting by first making drawings and then painting oil sketches of their subject, the high polish they gave to their drawings seemed to the Impressionists tantamount to a lie. After the oil sketch, the artist would produce the final painting with the academic \"fini,\" changing the painting to meet stylistic standards and attempting to idealize the images and add perfect detail. Similarly, perspective is constructed geometrically on a flat surface and is not really the product of sight, Impressionists disavowed the devotion to mechanical techniques.\n\nRealists and Impressionists also defied the placement of still-life and landscape at the bottom of the hierarchy of genres. It is important to note that most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic ateliers. Claude Monet, Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, and even Henri Matisse were students under academic artists.\n\nAs modern art and its avant-garde gained more power, academic art was further denigrated, and seen as sentimental, clichéd, conservative, non-innovative, bourgeois, and \"styleless\". The French referred derisively to the style of academic art as \"L'art Pompier\" (\"pompier\" means \"fireman\") alluding to the paintings of Jacques-Louis David (who was held in esteem by the academy) which often depicted soldiers wearing fireman-like helmets. The paintings were called \"grandes machines\" which were said to have manufactured false emotion through contrivances and tricks.\n\nThis denigration of academic art reached its peak through the writings of art critic Clement Greenberg who stated that all academic art is \"kitsch\". Other artists, such as the Symbolist painters and some of the Surrealists, were kinder to the tradition. As painters who sought to bring imaginary vistas to life, these artists were more willing to learn from a strongly representational tradition. Once the tradition had come to be looked on as old-fashioned, the allegorical nudes and theatrically posed figures struck some viewers as bizarre and dreamlike.\n\nWith the goals of Postmodernism in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, academic art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, academic art has experienced a limited resurgence through the Classical Realist atelier movement. Still, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a few hundreds of dollars in auctions, some now fetch millions.\n\n"}

{"id": "1212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1212", "title": "Artist", "text": "Artist\n\nAn artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n\nWiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines the older broad meanings of the term \"artist\":\n\n\nThe Greek word \"techně\", often translated as \"art,\" implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, \"technicus\",\nbecame the source of the English words technique, technology, technical.\n\nIn Greek culture each of the nine Muses oversaw a different field of human creation:\n\nNo muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.\n\nThe word \"art\" derives from the Latin \"ars\" (stem \"art-\"), which, although literally defined, means \"skill method\" or \"technique\", and conveys a connotation of beauty.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word \"artist\" already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling \"craftsman\", while the word \"artesan\" was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some \"artisanal\" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.\n\nThe first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472): \"De re aedificatoria, De statua, De pictura\", which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a project behind).\n\nWith the Academies in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.\n\nMany contemporary definitions of \"artist\" and \"art\" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into kitsch.\n\n\"Artist\" is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as \"a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium\". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person creative in, innovative in, or adept at, an artistic practice.\n\nMost often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or 'high culture', activities such as drawing, painting, sculpture, acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, new media, photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an aesthetic value. Art historians and critics define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the applied arts or decorative arts include artisan, craftsman, and specialized terms such as potter, goldsmith or glassblower. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the Renaissance in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.\n\nThe term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-\"art\" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.\n\nOften, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among \"artist\" and \"technician\", \"entertainer\" and \"artisan\", \"fine art\" and \"applied art\", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word \"artiste\" (which in French, simply means \"artist\") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in Music Hall or Vaudeville). Use of the word \"artiste\" can also be a pejorative term.\n\nThe English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.\n\nIn \"Living with Art\", Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:\n\nAfter looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between \"arts for art's sake\" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that \"this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down\" (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies many visual artists as either \"craft artists\" or \"fine artists\". A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing. A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as book illustrations or medical illustrations), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.\n\nThe main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice. Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts. Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.\n\nThe number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields. About half of US artists are self-employed. Others work in a variety of industries. For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.\n\nIn the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year. This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as graphic designers, multimedia artists, animators, and fashion designers. Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.\n\n\n"}

The most serious violations included the murder of Pakistani Qawwali singer Amjad Sabri and the killing of Burundi musician Pascal Treasury Nshimirimana.\n\n"}

{"id": "4120340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4120340", "title": "Arts District, Los Angeles", "text": "Arts District, Los Angeles\n\nThe Arts District is a neighborhood on the eastern edge of Downtown Los Angeles, California, United States. The gritty area has given new life to old industrial buildings whose history often dates to the early 20th century. While much of the early creative art was done behind closed doors, the street scene has slowly been activated in the early years of the 21st century as more and more factories are creatively reused with some new construction interspersed. Art galleries have opened and given recognition to the area amidst the entire downtown where Art museums and additional galleries can be found. The city community planning boundaries are Alameda Street on the west which blends into Little Tokyo, First Street on the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and Violet Street on the south.\n\nSpanish Father Juan Crespi founded what is now known as the Arts District in 1796 during an expedition going to Alta California. During his journey he discovered a body of water that was surrounded by rich soil, this then inspired a passage into his observation journal that states: \"Should a town be needed in this location, this site shall be called Our Lady Queen of the Angels.\" The small pueblo was declared a new territory for the Spanish and was officially founded on September 4, 1781.\n\nVignes Street winds through the northeastern edge of the Arts District, parallel to and a couple of blocks west of the broad cement trench that memorializes the L.A. River. It is named for Jean-Louis Vignes, an aging adventurer and vintner who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and Bordeaux. He planted grapes on 104 acres where Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc vines imported from the south of France thrived, and by 1849 El Aliso - what the Vignes vineyard was entitled, called so after the sacred local sycamore tree of the same name - was the largest producer of wine in California. The grapes are gone, but the San Antonio Winery just north of the community is a reminder of the area’s past.\n\nBy the late 19th century, oranges and grapefruit had replaced grapes as the principal agricultural products of the area and the property west of the riverbank was thick with citrus groves. The groves provided a location for filmmaker DW Griffith who filmed parts of Hollywood’s first feature film (\"In Old California\") there in 1909. A single grapefruit tree remains, towering over the Japanese American Plaza off San Pedro Street and Azusa. Somewhere near Third Street and Alameda, a print shop became the area’s first commercial arts enterprise, employing artists from around the region designing labels for the boxes of citrus fruit shipped across the country.\n\nThe growing Santa Fe Freight Depot and warehouses created to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs determined the area’s economic character for most of the next century and were responsible for the architectural flavor of the Arts District structures that have survived earthquakes, flood and fire. The single room hotels for rail workers to the northwest and the growth of Little Tokyo to the west and Chinatown to the north created a mix that was working class and cosmopolitan.\n\nBy World War II, the citrus groves had been replaced by factories and the rail freight business was giving way to the trucking industry. The area had taken on an industrial character that was growing seedy around the edges. Over the next twenty years, many of the independent small manufacturers had either been absorbed by larger competitors, grown too big for their quarters – or simply failed—and an increasing number of vacant warehouse and former factory spaces contributed to a dingy, decaying urban environment typical of many aging big American cities of the era.\n\nIn the 1950's many manufacturing companies fled oversees or were overtaken by larger manufacturing companies, resulting in vacant buildings and bringing property values down. Artists who were struggling to pay rent in the city started moving to the Arts District in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Before 1979 the Arts District buildings had been zoned for industrial use only. It wasn't until 1979 that the State of California passed a live/work legislation and in 1981 Los Angeles passed the bill Artist-In-Residence (AIR) . This new bill AIR would allow artists to live legally in the areas that could no longer be used for industrial use as long as they attained a business license. To make the living standards more comfortable the building code was lifted.New regulations had been created and the AIR legislation required the lofts to have a room to sleep, fire alarm, and other requirements for them to live legally.\n\nIn 1969, Allen Ruppersberg presented \"Al's Cafe\" at 1913 West Sixth Street. \nIn the mid-'70s, a handful of artists, including Joel Bass, Dan Citron, Woods Davy, Marc Kreisel, Jon Peterson, Stephen Seemayer, Maura Sheehan, Coleen Sterritt, Sydney Littenberg, Peter Zecher, and others saw opportunity in the empty buildings and began colonizing the area, converting former industrial and commercial spaces into working studios, sometimes renting space for as little as a three cents a square foot and carving out living quarters. This resulted in a surge of artistic activity, culminating in the highly controversial \"Downtown L.A. in Santa Barbara\" exhibition, organized by Betty Klausner for the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is now known as the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara. By the mid 1980s, the following artists were also living downtown: Linda Frye Burman, James Croak, Merion Estes, Joe Fay, George Herms, Mary Jones, Constance Mallinson, Paul McCarthy, Margaret Nielson, Richard Newton, Margit Omar, Lari Pittman, John Schroeder, Judy Simonian, Andy Wilf, and Takako Yamaguchi. Stephen Seemayer's film \"The Young Turks\"(2012) documents the 1979–1981 years.\n\nIn 1979, Marc Kreisel opened Al's Bar opened in the American Hotel on Hewitt just off Traction. This legendary punk rock venue was the training ground for Sonic Youth, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beck, the Fall, the Residents, introducing generations of Angelenos to dozens of emerging groups. The popular sound band \"Party Boys\" played the bars and art events.Also known as the downtown artists' central meeting place, Al's Bar occasionally hosted art exhibitions. Al's Bar, the west coast's oldest punk club, finally closed in 2001, and the American Hotel received a facelift in 2012 and was renamed the American Apartments.\n\nLA Artcore, founded in 1976 by Lydia Takeshita with the purpose of exhibiting local artists, exists today in locations at the Brewery Art Colony and in Little Tokyo. The Atomic Cafe on 1st Street at Alameda was an artists and musicians haunt in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) created exhibitions at its gallery space, located in the late 70s on Broadway St before moving to Industrial Street in the 1980s. Several commercial art galleries, including Oranges and Sardines, Kirk DeGoyer Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, Vanguard Gallery, Exile, and Galleria by the Water opened in the late seventies, only to close in the early eighties. Cirrus Editions, the first gallery to open downtown, remains open.\n\nAround 1980, Jon Peterson and Stephen Seemayer opened “DTLA,\" a club that had exactly one show before it closed, adjacent the Atomic Cafe. High Performance Magazine used DTLA as its performance space until its one-year lease was up. During that year, Paul McCarthy performed \"Monkey Man\" during the Public Spirit Performance Festival, Part 1. The name DTLA was later adopted by the neighboring coffee house where Beck got his start.\n\nIn 1981, the City of Los Angeles passed its \"Artist in Residence\" or \"AIR\" ordinance, which allowed residential use of formerly industrial and commercially zoned buildings; artists had long used such spaces as living quarters illegally, and the AIR law sought to bring this practice into legality and regulation. Art galleries, cafes and performance venues opened as the live/work population grew. \nDuring the '80s, Bedlam, created by artist Jim Fittipaldi, on 6th Street (and later, briefly, in the former premises of Al’s bar) was a salon with drawing workshops, art installations, theater, live music and a speakeasy. Dangerous Curve, on a dangerous curve of 4th Place between Mateo and Molino, put on exhibitions of artists whose work was often difficult to categorize. The Spanish Kitchen, a warehouse space on Third near Traction, was home to series of happenings, events, raves, installations and blowout parties. It now houses the 3rd Steakhouse and Lounge, an eatery that hosts community events and exhibitions of works by local artists. Cocola (later known as the 410 Boyd St. Bar and Grill), the legendary artists’ bar just west of the Arts District, lives on as Escondite.\n\nIn 1985, Fritz Frauchiger curated \"Off the Street,\" a \"one-time art exhibition\" sponsored by the Cultural Affairs Department in the Old City Print Shop, which featured paintings, sculptures, photographs and installations by 48 Los Angeles artists, most of whom lived downtown.\n\nIn 1994, the nonprofit group Downtown Arts Development Association (DADA) was formed as a spinoff of LARABA by several artist members of the LARABA board of directors in order to provide a platform for the burgeoning downtown art scene; DADA hosted exhibits of more than 400 downtown artists in 1994–1998. After 1994, the heart of the Arts District was Bloom’s General Store, presided over by Joel Bloom, a veteran of Chicago’s Second City, who became an advocate for the community and who is remembered as The Arts District’s once and only unofficial mayor. Bloom died in 2007, but his memory is honored with a plaque from the city declaring the triangle around Third, Traction and Rose to be Joel Bloom Square. Cornerstone Theater, an enterprise that brings community theater to locations all around the country, resided on Traction Avenue for 20 years. Around the corner, on Hewitt at 4th Pl., the non-profit ArtShare offers lessons in art, dance, theater and music to urban youth and features a small theater once used by Padua Playwrights. Padua stages plays around the city, often in non-traditional environments, and hosts play-writing workshops.\n\nThe Arts District is strategically located near the center of Downtown LA making it easier accessible for alternate forms of transportation. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Gold Line station is located along Alameda St. The cross section streets are along East First St. and East Temple St. The small neighborhood is also serviced by the Los Angeles Department of Transportations (LADOT) DASH bus making several stops on Hewitt St. Additionally, Metro offers a bike share program in many neighborhoods around the Arts District area. The following five stations currently available to pick up or leave a bike are listed below. There are a total of sixteen parking lots scattered around the Arts District. As the area became a social hub for Angelinos, parking became an issue to the local resident. Public and private lots/ structures including on street parking offer a variety of parking options for visitors. \n\nLos Angeles Conservancy has provided information regarding the registered landmarks in the Arts District neighborhood. The nodes offers economic stability and revitalization for the community. \nThe real estate history of the Arts District in Los Angeles doesn't fit the usual definition of \"gentrification.\" In the 1970s there were millions of square feet of empty commercial and industrial space in downtown LA. Around 1970, artists began to colonize these spaces illegally and use them for live in studios. In 1980, in order to legalize these ad-hoc and unsafe residences, the City of Los Angeles created the \"Artist in Residence\" zoning variation ordinance. The ordinance necessarily included mandated upgrades to the artists spaces, many of which had fire/safety/health issues endangering the (artist) occupants. It also enabled developers who wished to rehab or create new or old studios that were now legal. These developments, with their increased building and safety requirements, raised the retail rental rates from 10–30 cents per square foot to about 65 cents per square foot in the early to mid-1980s.\n\nIn the late 1980s and through the 1990s several (about 20) large artist loft projects were developed from empty industrial buildings, including The Brewery, 900 East 1st St, Citizens Warehouse, 2101 E. 7th St., and Long Beach Ave Lofts, with rents ranging from 65 to 75 cents/ sq ft.\n\nAfter 2000, developers started converting large office buildings in the area west of the arts district under a new \"Live/Work\" ordinance. These apartments were marketed as lofts, although they bore little resemblance to the much larger lofts in the industrial district east of Alameda St. Rents in these live/work spaces started in the early 2000s at about $1.10 / sq ft, and over the next 15 years climbed to about $2.50/sq ft, due mainly to the high demand for the apartments and the increasing purchase price for the undeveloped buildings.\n\nThe rapid \"loft\" development west of Alameda, in which hundreds of thousands of sq ft of heretofore unused commercial space has been converted to live/work apartments, has led to a renaissance in downtown Los Angeles, an area long considered uninhabitable by middle class Angelenos. The increased popularity for downtown residences has continued to put upward pressure on loft rent in the Arts District, pushing rents in some of the older, more authentic artists loft buildings upwards towards $1.50- $2.00/ sq ft., pushing many longtime artist/tenants out of their lofts.\n\nThe city community planning boundaries today are Alameda Street on the west, First Street on the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and Violet Street on the south. Challenges facing the Arts District today include the loss of affordable live/work lofts, loss of artists, and loss of historically significant buildings. Community leaders are struggling to create balance amidst the economic issues brought about by gentrification and the need to preserve the character of the Arts District as a creative community that has made contributions to the cultural and economic well-being of Los Angeles for decades. In 2014, the average annual income for neighborhood residents was $120,000. While the initial decades saw the conversion to residential and commercial uses of low-slung warehouses and industrial spaces, downtown zoning laws could be rewritten to permit the heights of buildings to double, allowing up to 1,500 new residential units to be built in 8-story, edifices.\n\nThe Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), resides in a quarter-mile-long () former Santa Fe Freight Depot built in 1907 that has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Across the street is a 438-unit apartment complex, \"One Santa Fe,\" that opened in 2014 and was designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture (MMA).\n\nThe century-old Coca-Cola manufacturing plant at 4th and Merrick streets, just around the corner from the enormous Santa Fe railroad dock that houses SCI-Arc, is the latest in adaptive reuse into creative spaces. The three-story brick-clad building was described as the \"headquarters for the company's Pacific Coast business and for its export trade in the Hawaiian Islands and Old Mexico\" when it was built in 1915.<ref name=\"LAT 3-7/2015\"></ref> The complex has been renamed Fourth & Traction after Traction Avenue. The Hauser Wirth & Schimmel complex opened in 2016 in buildings that date from the 1890s to the 1940s that occupy an entire city block on East 3rd Street.\n\nThe district continues to be a popular location for filming due to the historic vibe. In 2016, the head of the neighborhood’s business improvement district commented that “There’s not one day where there’s not shooting.” The popular TV sitcom New Girl takes place largely in their apartment loft located in the Arts District. Filming has become complicated due to the development of the retail sector, coffee shops, and residents who will be disturbed by filming at night. Also many formerly empty lots and desolate streets are now under development where crews used the space to park trucks and trailers.\n\nIn 2017 developer Suncal will proposed a 2 billion 1.95 million sq. ft mixed use project which includes two 58 story buildings designed by Hezorg and de Meuron. The project called 6 am will be located along 6th street between Mills and Alameda .The live/work space, will include 1,700 apartments and condos, shops, offices, hotels, charter school, and underground garage. Condos average price will be 1,000 per sq. ft. New developments have displaced artists since they can no longer afford the price hike in the Arts District. In 2016 the median price for property was $714,500. It's a huge increase from 2013 when open lofts were priced at 370 per sq ft.\n\nIn April 11, 2017 the district received a 15 million award from the Active Transportation Program which will enhance the Arts District with new bike lanes, enhancement of sidewalks,and street lighting. The program will bring two signalized intersections, pedestrian lighting, four pedestrian crosswalks, and one mile of bike lanes. Little Tokyo and Arts District Regional Connector Station will have pedestrian and bicycle access with the new Sixth Street Bridge.\n\nSome of the changes that will occur through the program are:\n\n· Pedestrian Plaza at Merrick St. and 4th St.\n\n· Controlled pedestrian crossing at 4th St./4th Place split.\n\n· Bike lanes on Santa Fe Ave. and Mateo St. down to 7th St.\n\n· Bike lanes on Traction Ave.\n\n· Pedestrian walkway and plaza space on 6th St Bridge frontage road \n\n"}

{"id": "808418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=808418", "title": "Black cat", "text": "Black cat\n\nA black cat is a domestic cat with black fur that may be a mixed or specific breed. The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 22 cat breeds that can come with solid black coats. The Bombay breed is exclusively black. All-black fur pigmentation is slightly more prevalent in male cats than female cats. Their high melanin pigment content causes most black cats to have yellow (golden) eyes (irises).\n\nAny cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a \"solid\" or \"self\". A \"solid black\" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a \"black smoke.\"\n\nBlack cats can also \"rust\" in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish shade. Eumelanin, the pigment that is required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer condition that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.\nIn addition to the Bombay, the Cat Fanciers' Association allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:\n\nThe exceptions are:\n\nThe folklore surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture. The Scots believe that a strange black cat's arrival to the home signifies prosperity. In Celtic mythology, a fairy known as the Cat sìth takes the form of a black cat. Black cats are also considered good luck in the rest of Britain and Japan. Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have many suitors. In Western history, black cats have typically been looked upon as a symbol of evil omens, specifically being suspected of being the familiars of witches, or actually shape-shifting witches themselves. Most of Europe considers the black cat a symbol of bad luck, particularly if one walks across the path in front of a person, which is believed to be an omen of misfortune and death. In Germany, some believe that black cats crossing a person's path from right to left, is a bad omen. But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times. In the United Kingdom it is commonly considered that a black cat crossing a person's path is a good omen.\n\nThe black cat in folklore has been able to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock, they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. They viewed the black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. They viewed the black cat as part demon and part sorcery. These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of \"satanic\" cats, or of burning them in midsummer bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIn contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a \"ship's cat\" would want a black one because it would bring good luck. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea (see Ship's cat). The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or Bastet), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch Charles I. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and charged with high treason.\n\nPirates of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.\n\nConversely in the United Kingdom if a black cat walks towards someone, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it. If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.\n\nBlack cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American shelters compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. The reasons given include not only superstition, but also the perception of black as \"boring\" compared to other colors as well as the belief that black cats don't photograph well. Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around Halloween for fear they will be tortured, or used as \"living decorations\" for the holiday and then abandoned. Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured. When such killings are reported, forensic evidence has pointed to natural predators, such as coyotes, eagles, or raptors as the likely cause. Limiting or suspending adoptions around Halloween also places more cats of all colors at risk of dying in shelters due to overcrowding. \n\nAugust 17 is \"Black Cat Appreciation Day.\" Wayne H. Morris created the day in honor of his late sister, June, who had a black cat, Sinbad. The day was chosen in memorial of June's passing.\n\nIn the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on VHF channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an \"unlucky\" channel number.\n\nSince the 1880s, the color black has been associated with anarchism. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an anarchist symbol.\n\nMore specifically, the black cat—often called the \"sab cat\" or \"sabo-tabby\"—is associated with anarcho-syndicalism, a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing (see Wildcat strike).\n\nIn testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of Industrial Workers of the World leaders, Ralph Chaplin, who is generally credited with creating the IWW's black cat symbol, stated that the black cat \"was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of sabotage. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss.\"\n\nWhen the Space Shuttle program naming system for missions was reworked to avoid an STS-13, some sourced this to superstition and Apollo 13. The crew for what would have been STS-13 (what turned out to be STS-41C) made a humorous mission patch that included a black cat and a number 13. The mission was successful and even landed on Friday the 13th. The other main reason for the new numbering system was to better accommodate a much higher number of launches.\n\n\nOctober 27 has been designated ‘Black Cat Day’ by Cats Protection in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to celebrate the virtues of black cats and to encourage people to adopt an unwanted black cat. Cats Protection's own figures suggest that black cats are more difficult for them to find a new home for than other colours. In 2014, the RSPCA reported that 70% of the abandoned cats in its care were black, suggesting a possible reason was that people considered black cats \"un-photogenic\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Black Cat Appreciation Day\" is August 17. Research by the ASPCA shows that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from shelters of any type of cat. This can be partly because of the superstition behind black cats such as their association with witchcraft or bad luck, or because they appear dull next to more colorful cats. In 2014 Toronto, Canada's largest city, held an event on Black Friday during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats. This trend had now spread across the United States, with many shelters offering free adoption of black cats on Black Friday.\n\nWith the success of the 2018 African-themed Superhero film, \"Black Panther\", there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film such as T'Challa and Shuri. It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the Black Panther to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.\n"}

{"id": "48462950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48462950", "title": "Color-blocking", "text": "Color-blocking\n\nColor-blocking is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations. It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, Piet Mondrian. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.\n\nIt’s widely believed by most historians that Piet Mondrian, a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend. Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism. In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods. Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with Georges Seurat and Claude Monet. However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as Yves Saint Laurent to create the famous Mondrian Dresses. Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. Pop Art incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution. Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s. The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion. Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.\n\nAs for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design. Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.\n\nIn the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit. Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit. It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.\n\nFashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.\n\nSince color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.\n\nColor-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching. In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.\n\n"}
{"id": "26246590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26246590", "title": "Color symbolism", "text": "Color symbolism\n\nColor symbolism in art and anthropology refers to the use of color as a symbol in various cultures. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures and even within the same culture in different time periods. The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis. Color symbolism is also context-dependent and influenced by changes over time. Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated. There is evidence to suggest that colors have been used for this purpose as early as 90,000 BC.\n\nRed is often associated with love, passion, and lust. It is frequently used in relation to Valentine's Day. It can also be used to signify danger or warning. For instance, it is used for stop signs and fire engines. In China, red is often used to symbolize good luck or happiness, and is used for many holidays or weddings.\n\nBlue is the color of the ocean and the sky; it often symbolizes serenity, stability, or inspiration. It can be a calming color, and symbolize reliability. In the Catholic Church, the Virgin Mary is most often depicted wearing blue, to symbolize her divinity. Blue is widely used for baby boys' clothes or bedrooms, although the reason blue is so strongly associated with boys is debated.\n\nYellow is a color often associated with sunshine or joy. It is sometimes used in association with cowardice or fear, i.e, the phrase \"yellow-bellied\". Children tend to like this color, and it is used to market products to children; it is also used for school buses and taxi cabs since it is such a bright, noticeable color.\n\nGreen is most often used to represent nature, healing, or fertility, since it's such a dominant color in nature. It can be a very relaxing color but is also used in the US to symbolize money, greed, or jealousy. Saying that someone is \"green\" means they're inexperienced or new.\n\nBlack, in Western culture, is considered a negative color and usually symbolizes death, grief, or evil. People often wear black for mourning, although this practice isn't as wide-spread as it was in the past.\n\nWhite most often symbolizes perfection, faith, innocence, softness, and cleanliness. Brides often wear white dresses to symbolize virginity or purity.\n\nPink is associated with softness, femininity, sweetness, and love. However, it was formerly used as a masculine color, frequently used for baby boys; it wasn't until the early 20th century that the gender roles of pink and blue were reversed.\n\nColor plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics. Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.\n\nMarketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence. There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France. In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named “off white” more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as “ancient silk.”\n\nColor symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.\n\nThere is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.\n\nColor has different meanings in different countries.  We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.  Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.  White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White’s positive connotation carries out into other aspects.  It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.  Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.  This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. \n\nWhen you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed.  Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.  Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative.  Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.  \n\nGreen is a color that is commonly found in Islam.  It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning.   The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.  If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.  If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. \n\nRed has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.  The color red has to do with love and passion.  In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.  The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.\n\nBlue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.\n\nYellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.  Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.  Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning.  Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.  For example, a yellow smile means to be mean. \n\nColor symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person’s preference and or their past experiences. \n\n"}

{"id": "1091420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1091420", "title": "Dahomey Amazons", "text": "Dahomey Amazons\n\nThe Dahomey Amazons or Mino, which means \"our mothers,\" were a Fon all-female military regiment of the Kingdom of Dahomey in the present-day Republic of Benin which lasted until the end of the 19th century. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons of ancient Anatolia and the Black Sea.\n\nKing Houegbadja (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of Dahomey, is said to have originally started the group which would become the Amazons as a corps of elephant hunters called the \"gbeto\".\n\nHouegbadja's son King Agaja (ruling from 1708 to 1732) established a female bodyguard armed with muskets. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, Agaja developed the bodyguard into a militia and successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of Savi in 1727. The group of female warriors was referred to as \"Mino\", meaning \"Our Mothers\" in the Fon language, by the male army of Dahomey. Other sources contest that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, however some contest if Queen Hangbe actually existed.\n\nFrom the time of King Ghezo (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as \"Amazons\", they called themselves \"ahosi\" (king's wives) or \"Mino\" (our mothers). Europeans exchanged goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms and fabrics for prisoners that the Dahomey captured during wars and raids.\n\nGhezo recruited both men and women soldiers from foreign captives, though women soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, some enrolled as young as 8 years old. Other accounts indicate that the \"Mino\" were recruited from among the \"ahosi\" (\"king's wives\") of which there were often hundreds. Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were involuntarily enrolled if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behavior.\n\nMembership among the \"Mino\" was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the Fon belief in Vodun.\n\nThe \"Mino\" trained with intense physical exercise. They learnt survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming acacia-thorn defenses in military exercises and executing prisoners. Discipline was emphasised.\n\nServing in the \"Mino\" offered women the opportunity to \"rise to positions of command and influence\" in an environment structured for individual empowerment. The \"Mino\" were also wealthy and held high status.\n\nThe \"Mino\" took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with Abeokuta and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in palm oil above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.\n\nApart from the Council, the Annual Customs of Dahomey included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs consisted of a mock battle in which the Amazons attacked a \"fort\" and \"captured\" the slaves within, a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.\n\nThe women soldiers were rigorously trained and given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. These documented reports also indicated that the women soldiers suffered several defeats.\n\nThe women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a center wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a female warrior counterpart. In an 1849/50 account by an Englishman, it was documented that the women that had three stripes of whitewash around each leg, were honored with marks of distinction.\n\nThe women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers, and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.\n\nIn the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. A 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant, \"a[s] the blacksmith takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men.\" \n\nThe Dahomey kingdom was often at war with its neighbors, and captives were needed for the slave trade. The Dahomey women soldiers fought in slave raids, as referenced in the Zora Neale Hurston non-fiction work , and in the unsuccessful wars against Abeokuta.\n\nEuropean encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King Béhanzin started fighting French forces in the course of the First Franco-Dahomean War. European observers noted that they \"handled admirably\" in hand to hand combat, but that they did not know how to use their flintlocks. The Amazons participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahoney (including many Amazons) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Despite the compliments given to them by the Europeans, the Amazons were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down while 129 Dahomey were killed in melee combat within the French lines. The French lost 5 men killed and a few dozen wounded. \n\nAccording to Holmes, many of the French soldiers fighting in Dahomey hesitated before shooting or bayoneting the Amazons. The resulting delay led to many of the French casualties. By the end of the Second Franco-Dahomean War, special units of the Amazons were being assigned specifically to target French officers. After several battles, the French prevailed in the Second Franco-Dahomean War and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. The legionnaires were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about the \"incredible courage and audacity.\" Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey Amazons could not prevail. During a battle with French soldiers at Adegon on October 6 during the second war, the bulk of the Amazon corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. For the loss of 86 Regulars and 417 Amazons, the Dahomey only managed to kill 6 French troops in the melee.\n\nThe troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French protectorate. Oral tradition states that some surviving amazons secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of Agoli-Agbo, the brother of Béhanzin, disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.\n\nSome of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen ex-amazons, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1942, several British travelers in Abomey recorded encounters with ex-amazons, now old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards. The last survivor of the Dahomey Amazons is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview with a Beninese historian, Nawi claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.\n\nDahomey Amazons were represented in the 1987 film \"Cobra Verde\" by German director Werner Herzog. Ghezo's Amazons play a significant role in the novel \"Flash for Freedom!\" by George MacDonald Fraser.\n\nThe unit is also depicted in (a special edition of, and now DLC of) PC game \"\". In the African Kingdoms expansion to \"Age of Empires II\", Gbeto are the Malian unique unit. In either game, the Dahomey/Gbeto are the only female military units.\n\nA segment of \"QI\" Series 7 Episode 7 discussed Dahomey Amazons and showed a photo.\n\nReferenced in Stieg Larsson's novel \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\" in the prelude to Part 4 \"Rebooting System\".\n\nThe warriors are also mentioned in Patrick O'Brian's novel \"The Commodore\", book 17 of the Aubrey-Maturin series.\n\nThe main character of Charles R. Saunders fantasy novel \"Dossouye\", an ahosi of Abomey, is closely modelled on the Dahomey ahosi.\n\nP. C. Wren's 1917 book of short stories \"Stepsons of France\" contains a story called \"Here are Ladies\", describing a series of clashes between troops of the Foreign Legion and the Dahomey Amazons.\n\nThe warriors are also the main focus and written about in Layon Gray's stage play \"Black Sparta\".\n\nThe Dora Milaje, army/bodyguards to the \"Black Panther\", are based partially off the Dahomey Amazons.\n\nIn Zora Neale Hurston’s \"\", 86 year old Cudjo Lewis, the last known survivor of the slaver Clotilda, describes his own capture by Dahomey Amazons when he was 19 years old.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the ethnographer emphasizes what he or she considers important.\"\n\nAlthough emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.\nEmic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality. One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach \"is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms.\" As explained below, the term \"emic\" originated from the specific linguistic term \"phonemic\", from \"phoneme\", which is a language-specific way of abstracting speech sounds.\nWhen these two approaches are combined, the “richest” view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.\n\nThe terms were coined in 1954 by linguist Kenneth Pike, who argued that the tools developed for describing linguistic behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective. Pike's innovation was to turn away from an epistemological debate, and turn instead to a methodological solution. \"Emic\" and \"etic\" are derived from the linguistic terms phonemic and phonetic respectively, which are in turn derived from Greek roots. The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic/etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of objectivity.\n\nThe terms were also championed by anthropologists Ward Goodenough and Marvin Harris with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.\n\nPike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\" are equally capable of producing emic \"and\" etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use \"etic\" to refer to objective or outsider accounts, and \"emic\" to refer to subjective or insider accounts.\n\nMargaret Mead was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because adolescents globally have the same hormones being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and personality could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way. Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual’s personality.\nCarl Jung, a Swiss psychoanalyst, is a researcher who took an etic approach in his studies. Jung studied mythology, religion, ancient rituals, and dreams leading him to believe that there are archetypes that can be identified and used to categorize people’s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information. The main archetypes that Jung studied were the persona (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the animus/ anima (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the shadow (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil. Well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the mother and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that “infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.” This way of looking at the mother is an etic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.\n\nEmic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise “when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross- cultural generalizations about personality.” It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod). The F-scale, which was created by Theodor Adorno, is used to measure Authoritarian Personality, which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans accurately depicts prejudices towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in South Africa using the F-Scale, (Pettigrew and Friedman) results did not predict any anti-Black prejudices. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.\n\nOther explorations of the differences between reality and humans' models of it:\n\n\n"}

A common fetish theme is a woman dressed as a dominatrix.\n\nMany of the 'classic' 1940s, 1950s and 1960s-era fetish artists such as Eric Stanton and Gene Bilbrew began their careers at Irving Klaw's Movie Star News company (later Nutrix), creating drawings for episodic illustrated bondage stories.\n\nIn 1946 fetish artist John Coutts (a.k.a. John Willie) founded \"Bizarre\" magazine. Bizarre was first published in Canada, then printed in the U.S., and was the inspiration for a number of new fetish magazines such as \"Bizarre Life\". In 1957 English engineer John Sutcliffe founded \"Atomage\" magazine, which featured images of the rubber clothing he had made. Sutcliffe's work would inspire Dianna Rigg's leather-catsuit-wearing character in \"The Avengers\", a TV show that \"opened the floodgates for fetish-SM images\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, fetish artists like Robert Bishop were published extensively in bondage magazines. In recent years, the annual SIGNY awards have been awarded to the bondage artists voted the best of that year. Many artists working in the mainstream comic book industry have included fetishistic imagery in their work, usually as a shock tactic or to denote villainy or corruption. The boost that depictions of beautiful women in tight fetish outfits give to the sales of comics to a mostly teenage male comic-buying audience may also be a factor.\n\nIn 1950s America comics with bondage or fetish themes began appearing. Around the same time, fetish artists influenced the cartoons of George Petty, Alberto Vargas and others, which featured in magazines like \"Playboy\" and \"Esquire\". Arguably the best known example of fetish imagery in comics is the catsuit-wearing, whip-wielding \"Catwoman\", who has been called, \"an icon of fetish art\".\n\nMany S&M, leather and fetish artists have produced images depicting urine fetishism (\"watersports\"), including Domino, Tom of Finland, Matt and The Hun.\n\nMainstream fine artists such as Allen Jones have included strong fetish elements in their work. An artist whose erotica transcends to mainstream collectors is found in the Shunga and Shibari style works of Hajime Sorayama. Taschen books included artist Hajime Sorayama, whom his peer artists call a cross between Norman Rockwell and Salvador Dali, or an imaginative modern day Vargas. Sorayama's robotic diverse illustrative works are in the permanent collections of the New York City Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as the fetish arts in the private World Erotic Art Museum Miami collection.\n\nThe works of contemporary fetish artists such as Roberto Baldazzini and Michael Manning are published by companies such as NBM Publishing and Taschen.\n\n"}
{"id": "31908016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31908016", "title": "Fictive art", "text": "Fictive art\n\nFictive art is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.\n\nThe term fictive art was originated by the artists Antoinette LaFarge and Lise Patt, in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms superfiction and parafiction but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include \"More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness\" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and \"Faking It\" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).\n\nFictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of Thomas Chatterton, the 'Formosan' inventions of George Psalmanazar, or the Cottingley fairy photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as mockumentaries. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson (The Museum of Jurassic Technology), Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick (The Circular River), Beauvais Lyons (The Hokes Archives), Joan Fontcuberta (Sputnik), Eve Andree Laramee (Yves Fissiault), and Jim Shaw (O-ism).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "773685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=773685", "title": "Formalism (art)", "text": "Formalism (art)\n\nIn art history, formalism is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and style. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes compositional elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.\n\nThe historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to Immanuel Kant and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: \"Every form of the objects of sense is either \"figure\" (\"Gestalt\") or \"play\" (\"Spiel\"). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (\"Reiz\") of colors... may be added, but the delineations (\"Zeichnung\") in the... composition (\"Komposition\")... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste.\" The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: \"Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the \"Critique of Judgment\" in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist.\"\n\nThe philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties \"that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times.\" The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as \"the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties.\"\n\nAccording to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies \"extreme formalists\" who think \"that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties,\" then he defines \"anti-formalist\" thinkers as those who \"think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties.\" The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of \"moderate formalism\", where its principal exponents defend the principle \"that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored.\"\n\nThe philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled \"Deep Formalism\", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: \"a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol.\" Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.\n\nA formal analysis is an academic method in art history and criticism for analyzing works of art: \"In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively\".\n\n\n"}

Georges Simenon, the creator of the Maigret detective novels, has been described by André Gide as \"the most novelistic of novelists in French literature\".\n\nThe main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror. More commercially oriented genre fiction has been dismissed by literary critics as poorly written or escapist.\n\nIn the publishing industry the term \"category fiction\" is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as Western or mystery.\n\nThe uncategorized section is known in the industry as \"general fiction\", but in fact many of the titles in this usually large section are often themselves genre novels that have been placed in the general section because sellers believe they will appeal, due to their high quality or other special characteristics, to a wider audience than merely the readers of that genre.\n\nAdult fans are often embarrassed to read genre fiction in public, but authors known for literary fiction have written novels under pseudonyms. With the demise of the hardback book, distinctions between genre fiction and literary fiction may begin to blur, with appropriate changes in marketing.\n\nThough a production not promoted by secondary criticism it is popular literature that holds the largest market share. Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.\n\nGenre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature. Poetry, prose, and drama each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Among the genres were the epic in poetry and tragedy and comedy for plays. In later periods other genres such as the chivalric romance, opera, and prose fiction developed.\n\nThough the novel is often seen as a modern genre, Ian Watt, in \"The Rise of the Novel\" (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century, it has also been described as possessing \"a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years\", from the time of both Classical Greece and Rome.\n\nThe \"romance\" is a closely related long prose narrative. Walter Scott defined it as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\", whereas in the novel \"the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society\". However, many romances, including the historical romances of Scott, Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\" and Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a \"kindred term\". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: \"a novel is \"le roman\", \"der Roman\", \"il romanzo\".\"\n\nGenre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its \"romance\" version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the mass-marketing of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the gothic novel, fantasy, science fiction, adventure novel, historical romance, and the detective novel. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction romance novels in literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Samuel Richardson's sentimental novel \"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded\" (1740) and the novels of Jane Austen such as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813).\n\nThe following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:\n\nCrime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalises crimes, their detection, criminals, and their motives. It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as historical fiction or science fiction, but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple subgenres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, mystery fiction, and legal thrillers. Suspense and mystery are key elements to the genre.\n\nFantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features a medieval-type setting.\n\nThe romance novel or \"romantic novel\" primarily focuses on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" There are many subgenres of the romance novel including fantasy, historical, science fiction, same sex romantic fiction, and paranormal fiction.\n\nThere is a literary fiction form of romance, which Walter Scott defined as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\".\n\nAccording to \"Romance Writers of America\" data, the most important subgenres are: Contemporary series romance, Contemporary romance, Historical romance, Paranormal romance, Romantic suspense, Inspirational romance, Romantic suspense (series).\n\nScience fiction is a genre of speculative fiction dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \"literature of ideas\". It usually eschews the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.\n\nWestern fiction is defined primarily by being set in the American West in the second half of the 19th century and, secondarily, by featuring heroes who are rugged, individualistic horsemen (cowboys). Other genres, such as romance, have subgenres that make use of the Western setting.\n\nInspirational fiction is fictional works with faith-based themes. It may be targeted at a specific demographic, such as Christians. Modern inspirational fiction has grown to encompass non-traditional subgenres, such as inspirational thrillers.\n\nHorror fiction aims to frighten or disgust its readers. Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not required. Early horror took much inspiration from Romanticism and Gothic fiction. Modern horror, such as cosmic horror and splatterpunk, tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit. Horror is often mixed with other genres.\n\nAlthough frequently ignored or ridiculed by literary critics, genre fiction has achieved a measure of acceptance among some modern critics, with Stephen King being awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters; but this polarized opinions and led to debate on genre fiction's literary merit. Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from \"Time\", \"Salon\", \"the Atlantic\", and the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\". Nobel laureate Doris Lessing described science fiction as \"some of the best social fiction of our time\", and called Greg Bear, author of \"Blood Music\", \"a great writer\". \n\nA number of major literary figures have written works of genre fiction. Graham Greene at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism, and of \"suspense-filled stories of detection\". Acclaimed during his lifetime, he was shortlisted in 1966 for the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nIn the 2000s, the BBC defended itself against charges that it had sneered at genre fiction, while the Man Booker and National Book Awards have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process. \n\nSome critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.\n\nSir John Barrow's descriptive 1831 account of the Mutiny on the Bounty immortalised the Royal Navy ship and her people. The legend of Dick Turpin was popularised when the 18th-century English highwayman's exploits appeared in the novel \"Rookwood\" in 1834.\n\nAlthough pre-dated by John Ruskin's \"The King of the Golden River\" in 1841, the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of \"The Princess and the Goblin\" and \"Phantastes\" (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins' epistolary novel \"The Moonstone\" (1868), is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, while \"The Woman in White\" is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels. H. G. Wells's (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like \"The Time Machine\" (1895), and \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like \"Kipps\" (1905) and \"The History of Mr Polly\" (1910).\n\nPenny dreadful publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous Sweeney Todd. The premier ghost story writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu. His works include the macabre mystery novel \"Uncle Silas\" 1865, and his Gothic novella \"Carmilla\" 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori's \"The Vampyre\" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem \"The Giaour\". An important later work is \"Varney the Vampire\" (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the \"sympathetic vampire\", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it. Bram Stoker, yet another Irish writer, was the author of seminal horror work \"Dracula\" and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula, with the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing his arch-enemy. \"Dracula\" has been attributed to a number of literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, gothic novel and invasion literature.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant London-based \"consulting detective\", famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes' archenemy Professor Moriarty, is widely considered to be the first true example of a supervillain, while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr John H. Watson.\n\nThe Lost World literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. H. Rider Haggard wrote one of the earliest examples, \"King Solomon's Mines\" in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed Anthony Hope's swashbuckling Ruritanian adventure novels \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" 1894, and \"Rupert of Hentzau\", 1898.\n\nF. Anstey's comic novel \"Vice Versa\" 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat\" 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river Thames. Grossmith brothers George & Weedon's \"Diary of a Nobody\" 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.\n\nErskine Childers' \"The Riddle of the Sands\" (1903), defined the spy novel and Follett has also called it \"the first modern thriller\".\n\nEmma Orczy's \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the French Revolutionary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her \"reckless daredevil\" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a musical and other media. Baroness Orczy's character \"The Old Man in the Corner\" (1908) was among the earliest armchair detectives to be created. Her short stories about \"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard\" (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.\n\nJohn Buchan wrote the adventure novels on \"Prester John\" (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of Richard Hannay, of which the first, \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the interwar period, exemplified by the series of H. C. McNeile with \"Bulldog Drummond\" (1920), and Leslie Charteris, whose many books chronicled the adventures of Simon Templar, alias \"The Saint\".\n\nThe medievalist scholar M. R. James wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.\n\nThis was called the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. Agatha Christie, a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative twist ending had a significant impact on the genre), \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1934), \"Death on the Nile\" (1937) and \"And Then There Were None\" (1939). Other female writers dubbed \"Queens of crime\" include Dorothy L. Sayers (gentleman detective, Lord Peter Wimsey), Margery Allingham (Albert Campion, supposedly created as a parody of Sayers' Wimsey,) and New Zealander Ngaio Marsh (Roderick Alleyn). Georgette Heyer recreated the historical romance genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).\n\nA major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" by Scottish writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920. It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher Colin Wilson as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century\", and was a central influence on C. S. Lewis's \"Space Trilogy\". Also J. R. R. Tolkien said he read the book \"with avidity\", and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality. It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in 1968.\n\nFrom the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the \"Inklings\". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lewis is known for \"The Screwtape Letters\" (1942), \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" (1950–1956) and \"The Space Trilogy\" (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of \"The Hobbit\" (1937), \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1954–1955), and \"The Silmarillion\" (1977).\n\nIn thriller writing, Ian Fleming created the character James Bond 007 in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including \"Casino Royale\" (1953), \"Live and Let Die\" (1954), \"Dr. No\" (1958), \"Goldfinger\" (1959), \"Thunderball\" (1961), \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1962), and nine short story works.\n\nIn contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, John le Carré was an author of spy novels who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" (1963), is often regarded as one of the greatest in the genre. Frederick Forsyth writes thriller novels, including \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1971), \"The Odessa File\" (1972), \"The Dogs of War\" (1974) and \"The Fourth Protocol\" (1984). Ken Follett writes spy thrillers, his first success being \"Eye of the Needle\" (1978), followed by \"The Key to Rebecca\" (1980), as well as historical novels, notably \"The Pillars of the Earth\" (1989), and its sequel \"World Without End\" (2007). Elleston Trevor is remembered for his 1964 adventure story \"The Flight of the Phoenix\", while the thriller novelist Philip Nicholson is best known for \"Man on Fire\". Peter George's \"Red Alert\" (1958), is a Cold War thriller.\n\nWar novels include Alistair MacLean thriller's \"The Guns of Navarone\" (1957), \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), and Jack Higgins' \"The Eagle Has Landed\" (1975). Patrick O'Brian's nautical historical novels feature the \"Aubrey–Maturin series\" set in the Royal Navy, the first being \"Master and Commander\" (1969).\n\nThe \"father of Wicca\", Gerald Gardner, began propagating his own version of witchcraft in the 1950s. Having claimed to have been initiated into the New Forest coven in 1939, Gardner published his books \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954) and \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\" (1959), the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca. Ronald Welch's Carnegie Medal winning novel \"Knight Crusader\" is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the Third Crusade, featuring the Christian leader and King of England Richard the Lionheart.\n\nIn crime fiction, the murder mysteries of Ruth Rendell and P. D. James are popular.\n\nNigel Tranter wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; Robert the Bruce in \"The Bruce Trilogy\", and William Wallace in \"The Wallace\" (1975), works noted by academics for their accuracy.\n\nJohn Wyndham wrote post-apocalyptic science fiction, his most notable works being \"The Day of the Triffids\" (1951), and \"The Midwich Cuckoos\" (1957). George Langelaan's \"The Fly\" (1957), is a science fiction short story. Science fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke's \"\" (1968), is based on his various short stories, particularly \"The Sentinel\" (1951). His other major novels include \"Rendezvous with Rama\" (1972), and \"The Fountains of Paradise\" (1979). Brian Aldiss is Clarke's contemporary.\n\nMichael Moorcock (born 1939) is a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, who has also published a number of literary novels. He was involved with the 'New Wave' of science fiction writers \"part of whose aim was to invest the genre with literary merit\" Similarly J. G. Ballard (born 1930) \"became known in the 1960s as the most prominent of the 'New Wave' science fiction writers\". A later major figure in science fiction was Iain M. Banks who created a fictional anarchist, socialist, and utopian society named \"The Culture\". The novels that feature in it include \"Excession\" (1996), and \"Inversions\" (1998). He also published mainstream novels, including the highly controversial \"The Wasp Factory\" in 1984. Nobel prize winner Doris Lessing also published a sequence of five science fiction novels the \"Canopus in Argos: Archives\" between 1979 and 1983.\n\nTerry Pratchett is best known for his \"Discworld\" series of comic fantasy novels, that begins with \"The Colour of Magic\" (1983), and includes \"Mort\" (1987), \"Hogfather\" (1996), and \"Night Watch\" (2002). Pratchett's other most notable work is the 1990 novel \"Good Omens\".\n\nPhilip Pullman's fantasy trilogy \"His Dark Materials\" comprises \"Northern Lights\" (1995), \"The Subtle Knife\" (1997), and \"The Amber Spyglass\" (2000). It follows the coming-of-age of two children as they wander through a series of parallel universes against a backdrop of epic events.\n\nNeil Gaiman is a writer of science fiction, fantasy short stories and novels, whose notable works include \"Stardust\" (1998), \"Coraline\" (2002), \"The Graveyard Book\" (2009), and \"The Sandman\" series.\n\nAlan Moore's works include \"Watchmen\", \"V for Vendetta\" set in a dystopian future UK, \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", and \"From Hell\", speculating on the identity and motives of Jack the Ripper.\n\nDouglas Adams wrote the five-volume science fiction comedy series \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", and also wrote the humorous fantasy detective novel \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\".\n\nClive Barker horror novels include \"The Hellbound Heart\" (1986), and works in fantasy, \"Weaveworld\" (1987), \"Imajica\" and \"Abarat\" (2002).\n\nMost genres of fiction may also be segmented by the age of the intended reader:\n\n"}
{"id": "58902810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58902810", "title": "Harry Underwood", "text": "Harry Underwood\n\nHarry Underwood (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.\n\nHarry has been labelled an outsider artist, a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that \"what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of Edward Hopper meets Salvador Dali meets Andy Warhol.\" \n\nHe is popularly known by his first name \"Harry\", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.\n\nHarry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.\n\nAs a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.\n\nHarry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.\n\nHarry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.\n\nHis first major solo show was titled \"A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking\" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.\n\nThough labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered \"I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "841792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=841792", "title": "Kinetic art", "text": "Kinetic art\n\nKinetic art is art from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or depends on motion for its effect. Canvas paintings that extend the viewer's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art. More pertinently speaking, kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional sculptures and figures such as mobiles that move naturally or are machine operated (see e. g. videos on this page of works of George Rickey, Uli Aschenborn and Sarnikoff). The moving parts are generally powered by wind, a motor or the observer. Kinetic art encompasses a wide variety of overlapping techniques and styles.\n\nThere is also a portion of kinetic art that includes virtual movement, or rather movement perceived from only certain angles or sections of the work. This term also clashes frequently with the term \"apparent movement\", which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors, machines, or electrically powered systems. Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of op art. The amount of overlap between kinetic and op art is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term, but there are distinctions that have yet to be made.\n\n\"Kinetic art\" as a moniker developed from a number of sources. Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century impressionist artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Édouard Manet who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas. This triumvirate of impressionist painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries. Degas’ dancer and racehorse portraits are examples of what he believed to be \"photographic realism\"; artists such as Degas in the late 19th century felt the need to challenge the movement toward photography with vivid, cadenced landscapes and portraits.\n\nBy the early 1900s, certain artists grew closer and closer to ascribing their art to dynamic motion. Naum Gabo, one of the two artists attributed to naming this style, wrote frequently about his work as examples of \"kinetic rhythm\". He felt that his moving sculpture \"Kinetic Construction\" (also dubbed \"Standing Wave\", 1919–20) was the first of its kind in the 20th century. From the 1920s until the 1960s, the style of kinetic art was reshaped by a number of other artists who experimented with mobiles and new forms of sculpture.\n\nThe strides made by artists to \"lift the figures and scenery off the page and prove undeniably that art is not rigid\" (Calder, 1954) took significant innovations and changes in compositional style. Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet were the three artists of the 19th century that initiated those changes in the Impressionist movement. Even though they each took unique approaches to incorporating movement in their works, they did so with the intention of being a realist. In the same period, Auguste Rodin was an artist whose early works spoke in support of the developing kinetic movement in art. However, Auguste Rodin's later criticisms of the movement indirectly challenged the abilities of Manet, Degas, and Monet, claiming that it is impossible to exactly capture a moment in time and give it the vitality that is seen in real life.\n\nIt is almost impossible to ascribe Manet's work to any one era or style of art. One of his works that is truly on the brink of a new style is \"Le Ballet Espagnol\" (1862). The figures' contours coincide with their gestures as a way to suggest depth in relation to one another and in relation to the setting. Manet also accentuates the lack of equilibrium in this work to project to the viewer that he or she is on the edge of a moment that is seconds away from passing. The blurred, hazy sense of color and shadow in this work similarly place the viewer in a fleeting moment.\n\nIn 1863, Manet extended his study of movement on flat canvas with \"Le déjeuner sur l'herbe\". The light, color, and composition are the same, but he adds a new structure to the background figures. The woman bending in the background is not completely scaled as if she were far away from the figures in the foreground. The lack of spacing is Manet's method of creating snapshot, near-invasive movement similar to his blurring of the foreground objects in \"Le Ballet Espagnol\".\n\nEdgar Degas is believed to be the intellectual extension of Manet, but more radical for the impressionist community. Degas' subjects are the epitome of the impressionist era; he finds great inspiration in images of ballet dancers and horse races. His \"modern subjects\" never obscured his objective of creating moving art. In his 1860 piece \"Jeunes Spartiates s'exerçant à la lutte\", he capitalizes on the classic impressionist nudes but expands on the overall concept. He places them in a flat landscape and gives them dramatic gestures, and for him this pointed to a new theme of \"youth in movement\".\n\nOne of his most revolutionary works, \"L’Orchestre de l’Opéra\" (1868) interprets forms of definite movement and gives them multidimensional movement beyond the flatness of the canvas. He positions the orchestra directly in the viewer’s space, while the dancers completely fill the background. Degas is alluding to the Impressionist style of combining movement, but almost redefines it in a way that was seldom seen in the late 1800s. In the 1870s, Degas continues this trend through his love of one shot motion horseraces in such works as \"Voiture aux Courses\" (1872).\n\nIt wasn’t until 1884 with \"Chevaux de Course\" that his attempt at creating dynamic art came to fruition. This work is part of a series of horse races and polo matches wherein the figures are well integrated into the landscape. The horses and their owners are depicted as if caught in a moment of intense deliberation, and then trotting away casually in other frames. The impressionist and overall artistic community were very impressed with this series, but were also shocked when they realized he based this series on actual photographs. Degas was not fazed by the criticisms of his integration of photography, and it actually inspired Monet to rely on similar technology.\n\nDegas and Monet's style was very similar in one way: both of them based their artistic interpretation on a direct \"retinal impression\" to create the feeling of variation and movement in their art. The subjects or images that were the foundation of their paintings came from an objective view of the world. As with Degas, many art historians consider that to be the subconscious effect photography had in that period of time. His 1860s works reflected many of the signs of movement that are visible in Degas' and Manet's work.\n\nBy 1875, Monet's touch becomes very swift in his new series, beginning with \"Le Bâteau-Atelier sur la Seine\". The landscape almost engulfs the whole canvas and has enough motion emanating from its inexact brushstrokes that the figures are a part of the motion. This painting along with \"Gare Saint-Lazare\" (1877-1878), proves to many art historians that Monet was redefining the style of the Impressionist era. Impressionism initially was defined by isolating color, light, and movement. In the late 1870s, Monet had pioneered a style that combined all three, while maintaining a focus on the popular subjects of the Impressionist era. Artists were often so struck by Monet's wispy brushstrokes that it was more than movement in his paintings, but a \"striking vibration\".\n\nAuguste Rodin at first was very impressed by Monet's 'vibrating works' and Degas' unique understanding of spatial relationships. As an artist and an author of art reviews, Rodin published multiple works supporting this style. He claimed that Monet and Degas' work created the illusion \"that art captures life through good modeling and movement\". In 1881, when Rodin first sculpted and produced his own works of art, he rejected his earlier notions. Sculpting put Rodin into a predicament that he felt no philosopher nor anyone could ever solve; how can artists impart movement and dramatic motions from works so solid as sculptures? After this conundrum occurred to him, he published new articles that didn't attack men such as Manet, Monet, and Degas intentionally, but propagated his own theories that Impressionism is not about communicating movement but presenting it in static form.\n\nThe surrealist style of the 20th century created an easy transition into the style of kinetic art. All artists now explored subject matter that would not have been socially acceptable to depict artistically. Artists went beyond solely painting landscapes or historical events, and felt the need to delve into the mundane and the extreme to interpret new styles. With the support of artists such as Albert Gleizes, other avant-garde artists such as Jackson Pollock and Max Bill felt as if they had found new inspiration to discover oddities that became the focus of kinetic art.\n\nGleizes was considered the ideal philosopher of the late 19th century and early 20th century arts in Europe, and more specifically France. His theories and treatises from 1912 on cubism gave him a renowned reputation in any artistic discussion. This reputation is what allowed him to act with considerable influence when supporting the plastic style or the rhythmic movement of art in the 1910s and 1920s. Gleizes published a theory on movement, which further articulated his theories on the psychological, artistic uses of movement in conjunction with the mentality that arises when considering movement. Gleizes asserted repeatedly in his publications that human creation implies the total renunciation of external sensation. That to him is what made art mobile when to many, including Rodin, it was rigidly and unflinchingly immobile.\n\nGleizes first stressed the necessity for rhythm in art. To him, rhythm meant the visually pleasant coinciding of figures in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Figures should be spaced mathematically, or systematically so that they appeared to interact with one another. Figures should also not have features that are too definite. They need to have shapes and compositions that are almost unclear, and from there the viewer can believe that the figures themselves are moving in that confined space. He wanted paintings, sculptures, and even the flat works of mid-19th-century artists to show how figures could impart on the viewer that there was great movement contained in a certain space. As a philosopher, Gleizes also studied the concept of artistic movement and how that appealed to the viewer. Gleizes updated his studies and publications through the 1930s, just as kinetic art was becoming popular.\n\nWhen Jackson Pollock created many of his famous works, the United States was already at the forefront of the kinetic art movement. The novel styles and methods he used to create his most famous pieces earned him the spot in the 1950s as the unchallenged leader of kinetic painters, his work was associated with Action painting coined by art critic Harold Rosenberg in the 1950s. Pollock had an unfettered desire to animate every aspect of his paintings. Pollock repeatedly said to himself, \"I am in every painting\". He used tools that most painters would never use, such as sticks, trowels, and knives. The shapes he created were what he thought was \"beautiful, erratic objects\".\n\nThis style evolved into his drip technique. Pollock repeatedly took buckets of paint and paintbrushes and flicked them around until the canvas was covered with squiggly lines and jagged strokes. In the next phase of his work, Pollock tested his style with uncommon materials. He painted his first work with aluminum paint in 1947, titled \"Cathedral\" and from there he tried his first \"splashes\" to destroy the unity of the material itself. He believed wholeheartedly that he was liberating the materials and structure of art from their forced confinements, and that is how he arrived at the moving or kinetic art that always existed. \n\nMax Bill became an almost complete disciple of the kinetic movement in the 1930s. He believed that kinetic art should be executed from a purely mathematical perspective. To him, using mathematics principles and understandings were one of the few ways that you could create objective movement. This theory applied to every artwork he created and how he created it. Bronze, marble, copper, and brass were four of the materials he used in his sculptures. He also enjoyed tricking the viewer’s eye when he or she first approached one of his sculptures. In his \"Construction with Suspended Cube\" (1935-1936) he created a mobile sculpture that generally appears to have perfect symmetry, but once the viewer glances at it from a different angle, there are aspects of asymmetry. \n\nMax Bill’s sculptures were only the beginning of the style of movement that kinetic explored. Tatlin, Rodchenko, and Calder especially took the stationary sculptures of the early 20th century and gave them the slightest freedom of motion. These three artists began with testing unpredictable movement, and from there tried to control the movement of their figures with technological enhancements. The term \"mobile\" comes from the ability to modify how gravity and other atmospheric conditions affect the artist’s work.\n\nAlthough there is very little distinction between the styles of mobiles in kinetic art, there is one distinction that can be made. Mobiles are no longer considered mobiles when the spectator has control over their movement. This is one of the features of virtual movement. When the piece only moves under certain circumstances that are not natural, or when the spectator controls the movement even slightly, the figure operates under virtual movement.\n\nKinetic art principles have also influenced mosaic art. For instance, kinetic-influenced mosaic pieces often use clear distinctions between bright and dark tiles, with three-dimensional shape, to create apparent shadows and movement.\n\nVladimir Tatlin is considered by many artists and art historians to be the first person to ever complete a mobile sculpture. The term mobile wasn't coined until Rodchenko's time, but is very applicable to Tatlin's work. His mobile is a series of suspended reliefs that only need a wall or a pedestal, and it would forever stay suspended. This early mobile, \"Contre-Reliefs Libérés Dans L'espace\" (1915) is judged as an incomplete work. It was a rhythm, much similar to the rhythmic styles of Pollock, that relied on the mathematical interlocking of planes that created a work freely suspended in air. \n\nTatlin never felt that his art was an object or a product that needed a clear beginning or a clear end. He felt above anything that his work was an evolving process. Many artists whom he befriended considered the mobile truly complete in 1936, but he disagreed vehemently. \n\nAlexander Rodchenko, one of Tatlin’s friends who insisted his work was complete, continued the study of suspended mobiles and created what he deemed to be \"non-objectivism\". This style was a study less focused on mobiles than on canvas paintings and objects that were immoveable. It focuses on juxtaposing objects of different materials and textures as a way to spark new ideas in the mind of the viewer. By creating discontinuity with the work, the viewer assumed that the figure was moving off the canvas or the medium to which it was restricted. One of his canvas works titled \"Dance, an Objectless Composition\" (1915) embodies that desire to place items and shapes of different textures and materials together to create an image that drew in the viewer’s focus.\n\nHowever, by the 1920s and 1930s, Rodchenko found a way to incorporate his theories of non-objectivism in mobile study. His 1920 piece \"Hanging Construction\" is a wood mobile that hangs from any ceiling by a string and rotates naturally. This mobile sculpture has concentric circles that exist in several planes, but the entire sculpture only rotates horizontally and vertically.\n\nAlexander Calder is an artist who many believe to have defined firmly and exactly the style of mobiles in kinetic art. Over years of studying his works, many critics allege that Calder was influenced by a wide variety of sources. Some claim that Chinese windbells were objects that closely resembled the shape and height of his earliest mobiles. Other art historians argue that the 1920s mobiles of Man Ray, including \"Shade\" (1920) had a direct influence on the growth of Calder’s art.\n\nWhen Calder first heard of these claims, he immediately admonished his critics. \"I have never been and never will be a product of anything more than myself. My art is my own, why bother stating something about my art that isn’t true?\" One of Calder’s first mobiles, \"Mobile\" (1938) was the work that \"proved\" to many art historians that Man Ray had an obvious influence on Calder’s style. Both \"Shade\" and \"Mobile\" have a single string attached to a wall or a structure that keeps it in the air. The two works have a crinkled feature that vibrates when air passes through it.\n\nRegardless of the obvious similarities, Calder’s style of mobiles created two types that are now referred to as the standard in kinetic art. There are object-mobiles and suspended mobiles. Object mobiles on supports come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and can move in any way. Suspended mobiles were first made with colored glass and small wooden objects that hung on long threads. Object mobiles were a part of Calder’s emerging style of mobiles that were originally stationary sculptures.\n\nIt can be argued, based on their similar shape and stance, that Calder’s earliest object mobiles have very little to do with kinetic art or moving art. By the 1960s, most art critics believed that Calder had perfected the style of object mobiles in such creations as the \"Cat Mobile\" (1966). In this piece, Calder allows the cat’s head and its tail to be subject to random motion, but its body is stationary. Calder did not start the trend in suspended mobiles, but he was the artist that became recognized for his apparent originality in mobile construction.\n\nOne of his earliest suspended mobiles, \"McCausland Mobile\" (1933), is different from many other contemporary mobiles simply because of the shapes of the two objects. Most mobile artists such as Rodchenko and Tatlin would never have thought to use such shapes because they didn’t seem malleable or even remotely aerodynamic.\n\nDespite the fact that Calder did not divulge most of the methods he used when creating his work, he admitted that he used mathematical relationships to make them. He only said that he created a balanced mobile by using direct variation proportions of weight and distance. Calder’s formulas changed with every new mobile he made, so other artists could never precisely imitate the work.\n\nBy the 1940s, new styles of mobiles as well as many types of sculpture and paintings incorporated the control of the spectator. Artists such as Calder, Tatlin, and Rodchenko produced more art through the 1960s, but they were also competing against other artists who appealed to different audiences. When artists such as Victor Vasarely developed a number of the first features of virtual movement in their art, kinetic art faced heavy criticism. This criticism lingered for years until the 1960s, when kinetic art was in a dormant period.\n\nVasarely created many works that were considered to be interactive in the 1940s. One of his works \"Gordes/Cristal\" (1946) is a series of cubic figures that are also electrically powered. When he first showed these figures at fairs and art exhibitions, he invited people up to the cubic shapes to press the switch and start the color and light show. Virtual movement is a style of kinetic art that can be associated with mobiles, but from this style of movement there are two more specific distinctions of kinetic art.\n\nApparent movement is a term ascribed to kinetic art that evolved only in the 1950s. Art historians believed that any type of kinetic art that was mobile independent of the viewer has apparent movement. This style includes works that range from Pollock’s drip technique all the way to Tatlin’s first mobile. By the 1960s, other art historians developed the phrase \"op art\" to refer to optical illusions and all optically stimulating art that was on canvas or stationary. This phrase often clashes with certain aspects of kinetic art that include mobiles that are generally stationary.\n\nIn 1955, for the exhibition \"Mouvements\" at the Denise René gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and Pontus Hulten promoted in their \"Yellow manifesto\" some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression \"kinetic art\" in this modern form first appeared at the Museum für Gestaltung of Zürich in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally included the form of optical art that mainly makes use of optical illusions, such as op art, represented by Bridget Riley, as well as art based on movement represented by Yacov Agam, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jesús Rafael Soto, Gregorio Vardanega, or Nicolas Schöffer. From 1961 to 1968, GRAV (\"Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel\") founded by François Morellet, Julio Le Parc, Francisco Sobrino, Horacio Garcia Rossi, Yvaral, Joël Stein and Vera Molnár was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists. According to its 1963 manifesto, GRAV appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behavior, notably through the use of interactive labyrinths.\n\nIn November 2013, the MIT Museum opened \"5000 Moving Parts\", an exhibition of kinetic art, featuring the work of Arthur Ganson, Anne Lilly, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, John Douglas Powers, and Takis. The exhibition inaugurates a \"year of kinetic art\" at the Museum, featuring special programming related to the artform.\n\nNeo-kinetic art has been popular in China where you can find interactive kinetic sculptures in many public places, including Wuhu International Sculpture Park and in Beijing.\n\n\n\n"}

He claimed rescission of the contract against International Galleries, to get back his money.\n\nDenning LJ held that Mr Leaf was barred because too much time had lapsed. He held that in the event of lapse of too much time between the making of the contract and the decision to rescind, the right to rescind is lost. He held there was a mistake about the quality of the subject matter because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable, and that mistake was fundamental. But it was not enough to void the contract, because there was no mistake about the essential subject matter (a painting). The painter's identity was a term of the contract, which could either be classified as a condition (breach of which allows termination of the contract) or a warranty (which allows damages only). Here the painter's identity was a condition, but after hanging it in one's house for five years it is far too late to reject the painting for breach of condition.\n\nJenkins LJ and Lord Evershed MR concurred.\n\nIn essence, the court held that there was no breach of contract, no \"operative mistake\", but there WAS misrepresentation.

{"id": "228566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228566", "title": "Mail art", "text": "Mail art\n\nMail art (also known as postal art and correspondence art) is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the postal service. It initially developed out of what eventually became Ray Johnson's New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the Fluxus movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.\n\nMedia commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called artistamps), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post. Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched. Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often unjuried) exhibition.\n\nMail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists. The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries. Mail artists rely on their alternative \"outsider\" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.\n\nMail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.\n\nArtist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.\n\nThe American artist Ray Johnson is considered to be the first mail artist. Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his \"moticos\", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.\n\nThe term \"mail art\" was coined in the 1960s. In 1962, Plunkett coined the term \"New York Correspondence School\" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as \"correspondance.\" The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.\n\nMost of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor. One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress Anna May Wong. Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.\n\nIn a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals. Correspondence is \"a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at ... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there ...\"\n\nIn 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the Whitney Museum in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.\n\nOn April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the \"death\" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of \"The New York Times\" and in copies that he circulated to his network. However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.\n\nAlthough much of Johnson's work was initially given away, this hasn't prevented it from attaining a market value. Andy Warhol is quoted as saying he would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson.\"\n\nIn his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of Fluxus, George Maciunas included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist Robert Filliou. Filliou coined the term the \"Eternal Network\" that has become synonymous with mail art. Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium. \"Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants. While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.\n\nIn the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders. It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.\n\nThe growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits, led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations. Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.\n\nIn 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the Franklin Furnace, New York, called \"Mail Art Then and Now.\" The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic Robert C. Morgan) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.\n\nThe night preceding the second panel on February 24, Carlo Pittore, John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, \"Have fun boys.\" Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee. \n\nThe excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist John P. Jacob in his short-lived mail art zine PostHype. In a letter to panelist Mark Bloch, Ray Johnson (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.\n\nThe rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various \"isms\" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition. Even if \"tourism\" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual \"Open Letter To Everybody in the Network\" stated, \"1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, \"use the channels\"! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc. 5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity.\" The manifesto concludes, \"We have learned this from our own mistakes.\" \n\nIn 1994, Dutch mail artist Ruud Janssen began a series of mail-interviews which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.\n\nBy the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication. The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers. Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation, even if many mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.\n\nIn spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices (visual poetry, copy art, artist's books) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market. Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged. While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of \"anything goes.\"\n\nThe mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the \"rules\" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited. The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.\nMail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide. Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the \"public\" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply \"mailed art.\"\n\nA mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China. In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors. Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.\nRay Johnson suggested (with a pun) that \"mail art has no history, only a present\", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies. Parody art movements like neoism and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names Monty Cantsin and Karen Eliot, which were proposed for serial use by anyone. Semi-fictional organizations have been set up and virtual lands invented, imaginary countries for which artistamps are issued. Furthermore, attempts have been made to document and define the history of a complex and underestimated phenomenon that has spanned five decades. Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.\nA sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/\n\nBecause the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.\n\nMail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by Dada and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.\nMail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the artistamp has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets. Artist Jerry Dreva of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single \"Ashes to Ashes\" released in 1980. Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes. The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book \"Art and Marginal Communication\", Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition \"Timbres d'artistes\", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.\n\nSome mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.\n\nPrinting is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network. Ubiquitous 'add & pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism. However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and zines about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation, while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.\n\nLettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network. Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.\n\nIn addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and friendship books, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.\nMail artists routinely mix media; collage and photomontage are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of pop art or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.\n\nPrinted matter and ephemera are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network. Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur (\"Hairmail\") and Astroturf postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.\n\nHaving borrowed the notion of intermedia from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and sound art have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.\n\nPerformance art has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.\n\n\"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price.\" - Ken Friedman\n\"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future.\" - Chuck Welch\n\n\"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction.\" - Loredana Parmesani\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}
{"id": "5971202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5971202", "title": "Marxist aesthetics", "text": "Marxist aesthetics\n\nMarxist aesthetics is a theory of aesthetics based on, or derived from, the theories of Karl Marx. It involves a dialectical and materialist, or dialectical materialist, approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics. For instance, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, who greatly influenced the art of the early Soviet Union, followed the secular humanism of Ludwig Feuerbach more than he followed Marx.\n\nMarxist aesthetics overlaps with the Marxist theory of art. It is particularly concerned with art practice, with the prescribing of artistic standards that are deemed socially beneficial. This materialist and socialist orientation may be seen to invoke (however problematically) the traditional aims of scientific inquiry and the scientific method.\n\nSome notable Marxist aestheticians include Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Lifshitz, William Morris, Theodor W. Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Georg Lukács, Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson, Louis Althusser, Jacques Rancière, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Raymond Williams. Roland Barthes must also be mentioned here.\n\nNot all of these figures are solely concerned with aesthetics: in many cases, Marxist aesthetics forms only an important branch of their work, depending on how one defines the term. For example, a Marxist aesthetic may be latent in Brecht's work, but he formulated his own distinct theory of art and its social purpose.\n\nOne of the chief concerns of Marxist aesthetics is to unite Marx and Engels’ social and economic theory, or theory of the social \"base\", to the domain of art and culture, the \"superstructure\". These two terms, base and superstructure, became an important dichotomy in \"The German Ideology\" (1846), which however was not published during their lifetimes. Likewise Marx's early \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\", which, though widely regarded as important for treating the themes of sensuousness and alienation, first appeared only in 1932 (the slated 1846 publication was canceled) and in English only in 1959. The manuscripts were therefore unknown to art theorists during, for instance, the often antagonistic debates on art in the early Soviet Union between the constructivist avant garde and the proponents of socialist realism. The controversy over the unusual design of the original documents adds another twist.\n\nMany theorists touch upon important themes of Marxist aesthetics without strictly being Marxist aestheticians, Joel Kovel, for instance, has extended the concepts of Marxian ecology which deeply implicates aesthetics. He is also a part of the struggle to bridge the space between Marx and Freud, which has Marxist aesthetics as a central concern. Current themes within the field include research on the effect of mass-produced industrial materials on the sensed environment, such as paints and colors. A strong current within the field involves linguistics and semiotics, and arguments over structuralism and post-structuralism, modernism and post-modernism, as well as feminist theory.\n\nVisual artists, as diverse as Isaak Brodsky or Diego Rivera and Kasimir Malevich or Lyubov Popova, for example, for whom written theory is secondary, nevertheless may be said to be connected to Marxist aesthetics through their production of art, without necessarily declaring themselves aestheticians or Marxists in writing. Likewise, in this spirit Oscar Wilde, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Orson Welles, Jean-Luc Godard, Pablo Picasso, Richard Paul Lohse, for example. Such a view could apply to many visual and other artists in many fields, even those who have no apparent and/or voiced connection to Marxist politics or even those ostensibly opposed; in this respect consider Anton Webern.\n\nProbably it would be fair to say that two of the most influential writings in Marxist aesthetics in recent times, and apart from Marx himself and Lukacs, have been Walter Benjamin's essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\", and Herbert Marcuse's \"One-Dimensional Man\". Louis Althusser has also contributed some small but significant essays on art and his theory of ideology also impacts in this area (\"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\").\n\nThe field remains polemical, with camps of modernists, post modernists, anti modernists, the avant garde, constructivists, social realists and socialist realists all referencing back to an ostensible Marxist aesthetic theory that would underpin their art practices by grounding an art theory.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20021276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20021276", "title": "Mexican muralism", "text": "Mexican muralism\n\nMexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement.\n\nMexico has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the Olmec civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine. The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was Juan Cordero in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the Santa Teresa Church and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of Gabino Barreda at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (since disappeared).\n\nThe latter 19th century was dominated politically by the Porfirio Díaz regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the Academy of San Carlos and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making Mexico like Europe. Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl, is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life. Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art. Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism. Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting. The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the Mexican Revolution . Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of José Guadalupe Posada, who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to Porfirio Díaz policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included Antonio Curo, Alfonso Reyes and José Vasconcelos. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.\n\nThese ideas gained power as a result of the Mexican Revolution, which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year. However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of Francisco I. Madero who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the Álvaro Obregón faction, which became the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.\n\nIn 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the Secretaría de Educación Pública. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose. Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals. These ideals or principles were to glorify the Mexican Revolution and the identity of Mexico as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish. The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including Diego Rivera. These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, Ramón Alva de la Canal, Federico Cantú and others but the main three would be David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by Roberto Montenegro, but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out. The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors. \nThe first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution Colegio San Ildefonso, at that time used for the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution; Fernando Leal painted [\"dancers of Chalma\"] \"Los danzantes de Chalma\", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, Jean Charlot painted \"La conquista de Tenochtitlán\" (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal. \n\nThis project at the institution was followed by projects at the Palacio Nacional, the interior walls of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Escuela Nacional de Chapingo the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the Secretaria de Educación Pública building among many others.\n\nThe movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings. One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors. The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts. On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of Marxism, especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.\n\nThe inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the \"heroic\" phase while the period after 1930 is the \"statist\" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924. Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who \"acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences\" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as \"propaganda for a corrupt state\" as taking a hard line. Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.\n\nArt historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement. The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico. The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society. Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.\n\nThe Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.\n\nMexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate. It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:\n1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse\n2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)\n3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image\nMost painters in this school worked in Mexico City or other cities in Mexico, working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of Mexico and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos. \n\nA large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the Mexican Revolution, mestizo identity and Mesoamerican cultural history. These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement. The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government. The other political orientation was that of Marxism, especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists. The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left. Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.\n\nThe murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted. The mural painters of Mexico freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures. Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the fresco, painting on freshly plastered walls and encaustic or hot wax painting . Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement. The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with pyroxlene, a commercial enamel and Duco (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.\n\nBy far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Siqueiros, called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones). All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution. Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote Marxist ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war. However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future. The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the Mexican Revolution. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work. There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.\n\nOf the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.\n\nOrozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class. His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future. His work shows an \"expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure.\" Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period. Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the Mexican Revolution, having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.\n\nSiqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the Venustiano Carranza army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines. Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a \"futurist blurring of form and technique.\" His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism. His radical politics made him unwelcome in Mexico and the United States, so he did much of his work in South America. However, his masterpiece is considered to be the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, located in Mexico City.\n\nThe Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. José Vasconcelos, the Secretary of Public Education under President Álvaro Obregón (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government. Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.\n\nIn 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.\n\nAfter nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country. One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the municipal market of Teotitlán del Valle, a small town in the state of Oaxaca. High school and college students from Georgia, United States, collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of Zapotec language and customs.\n\nMexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas. It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after World War I with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include Carlos Mérida of Guatemala, Oswaldo Guayasamín of Ecuador and Candido Portinari of Brazil .\nRivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at Pomona College in Claremont, California, staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country. Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the Museum of Modern Art. The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country. Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to Los Angeles. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over. The only one of the three to survive, (full name: \"América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos\", or \"Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism\"), was restored by the Getty Conservation Institute and the América Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access.\n\nThe concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the Southwest. It served as inspiration to the later Chicano muralism but the political messages are different. Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the Sandinista period.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36836451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36836451", "title": "Modern sculpture", "text": "Modern sculpture\n\nModern sculpture is generally considered to have begun with the work of Auguste Rodin, who is seen as the progenitor of modern sculpture. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works. He \"dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void\". Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like Edgar Degas and Paul Gauguin, Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, \"arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century\".\n\nModernist sculpture movements include Art Nouveau, Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Land art, Conceptual art, and Installation art among others.\n\nThe modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the Rodin exhibit at the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his Burghers of Calais, Balzac, Victor Hugo statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his Gates of Hell which included The Thinker.\n\nCubist sculpture, in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with cubist painting, and the formal experiments of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using collage, sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze \"Head of a Woman\" as the first cubist sculpture. Artists like Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and Alexander Archipenko, who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 \"Walking Woman\" were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead. Joseph Csaky, a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.\n\nIn the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his \"constructions\" fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was \"construction\" a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as \"sculpture\" that would not have been so previously, such as \"involuntary sculpture\" in several senses, including coulage. In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of ceramic art, with figures such as George E. Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson. Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the \"found object\" (French: \"objet trouvé\") or \"readymade\" with pieces such as Fountain (1917).\n\nSimilarly, the work of Constantin Brâncuși at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his \"Bird in Space\" series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture. In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.\n\nBrâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as Gaston Lachaise, Sir Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miró, Ásmundur Sveinsson, Julio González, Pablo Serrano, Jacques Lipchitz and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by Alexander Calder, Len Lye, Jean Tinguely, and Frederick Kiesler who were pioneers of Kinetic art.\n\nSince the 1950s Modernist trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge, -high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the \"Chicago Picasso\". He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.\n\nIn the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.\n\nBy the 1960s Abstract expressionism, Geometric abstraction and Minimalism, which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of Sir Anthony Caro, as well as welded sculpture by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of John Chamberlain, and environmental installation scale works by Mark di Suvero. Other Minimalists and Postminimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, Ronald Bladen, Giacomo Benevelli, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Eva Hesse, Christo, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, and others like John Safer who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line. led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: George Segal, Claes Oldenburg, Arman, Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Manuel Neri and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were Robert Graham in a classic articulated style and Fernando Botero bringing his painting's \"oversized figures\" into monumental sculptures. Ceramic sculpture as practiced by Pablo Picasso, Peter Voulkos, Stephen De Staebler, Kenneth Price, and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.\n\nSite specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Andy Goldsworthy, Walter De Maria, Richard Long, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude-led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the \"land art in the American West\" group of projects. These land art or \"earth art\" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater). Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, and Bruce Nauman, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.\n\nAlso during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Eduardo Paolozzi, Chryssa, Walter De Maria, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through video art, environment, light sculpture, and installation art in new ways.\n\nConceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include \"One and Three Chairs\", 1965, by Joseph Kosuth, and \"An Oak Tree\", 1973, by Michael Craig-Martin, and those of Joseph Beuys and James Turrell among others.\n\nPostmodern sculpture occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. Rosalind Krauss identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of Land art, Minimalist sculpture, and site-specific art into the category of \"sculpture\":\n\n\nModern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in environmental art and environmental sculpture, often in full view of spectators. Light sculpture and site-specific art also often make use of the environment. Site-specific artwork is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors Patricia Johanson, Dennis Oppenheim, Athena Tacha, and others. Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic Lucy Lippard. Land art, Earthworks, (Earth art) is an art movement that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of nature generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, soil, rocks, logs, branches, leaves, and water, as well as man made materials like Chain-link fencing, barbed wire, rope, rubber, glass, concrete, metal, asphalt, and mineral pigments. Ice sculpture is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles. Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.\n\nSound sculptures take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. Art toys have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by Takashi Murakami and Kid Robot, designed by Michael Lau, or hand-made by Michael Leavitt.\n\n"}
{"id": "1969927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969927", "title": "Negative space", "text": "Negative space\n\nNegative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the \"real\" subject of an image.\n\nThe use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word \"ma\" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design.\n\nIn a two-tone, black-and-white image, a subject is normally depicted in black and the space around it is left blank (white), thereby forming a silhouette of the subject. Reversing the tones so that the space around the subject is printed black and the subject itself is left blank, however, causes the negative space to be apparent as it forms shapes around the subject. This is called figure-ground reversal.\n\nIn graphic design of printed or displayed materials, where effective communication is the objective, the use of negative space may be crucial. Not only within the typography, but in its placement in relation to the whole. It is the basis of why upper and lower case typography always is more legible than the use of all capital letters. Negative space varies around lower case letters, allowing the human eye to distinguish each word rapidly as one distinctive item, rather than having to parse out what the words are in a string of letters that all present the same overall profile as in all caps. The same judicious use of negative space drives the effectiveness of the entire design. Because of the long history of the use of black ink on white paper, \"white space\" is the term often used in graphics to identify the same separation.\n\nElements of an image that distract from the intended subject, or in the case of photography, objects in the same focal plane, are not considered negative space. Negative space may be used to depict a subject in a chosen medium by showing everything around the subject, but not the subject itself. Use of negative space will produce a silhouette of the subject. Most often, negative space is used as a neutral or contrasting background to draw attention to the main subject, which then is referred to as the positive space.\n\nConsidering and improving the balance between negative space and positive space in a composition is considered by many to enhance the design. This basic, but often overlooked, principle of design gives the eye a \"place to rest,\" increasing the appeal of a composition through subtle means.\n\nThe use of negative space in art may be analogous to silence in music, but only when it is juxtaposed with adjacent musical ideas. As such, there is a difference between inert and active silences in music, where the latter is more closely analogous to negative space in art.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1682480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1682480", "title": "Ormolu", "text": "Ormolu\n\nOrmolu (from French \"or moulu\", signifying ground or pounded gold) is an English term, used since the 18th century for the gilding technique of applying finely ground, high-carat gold–mercury amalgam to an object of bronze, and for objects finished in this way.\n\nThe mercury is driven off in a kiln leaving behind a gold coating. The French refer to this technique as \"bronze doré\"; in English, it is known as \"gilt bronze\".\n\nThe manufacture of true ormolu employs a process known as mercury-gilding or fire-gilding, in which a solution of mercuric nitrate is applied to a piece of copper, brass, or bronze; followed by the application of an amalgam of gold and mercury. The item is then exposed to extreme heat until the mercury vaporizes and the gold remains, adhering to the metal object.\n\nThis process has generally been supplanted by the electroplating of gold over a nickel substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.\n\nDue to exposure to the harmful mercury fumes, most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age. In literature there is a reference from John Webster:\n\nAfter around 1830, legislation in France had outlawed the use of mercury, although it continued to be commonly employed until around 1900 and was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like electroplating from the mid-19th century on) were utilized. Electroplating is the most common modern technique. Ormolu techniques are essentially the same as those used on silver, to produce silver-gilt (also known as vermeil).\n\nA later substitute of a mixture of metals resembling ormolu was developed in France and called \"pomponne\", though the mix of copper and zinc, sometimes with an addition of tin, is technically a type of brass. From the 19th century the term has been popularized to refer to gilt metal or imitation gold.\n\nGilt-bronze is found from antiquity onwards across Eurasia, and especially in Chinese art, where it was always more common than silver-gilt, the opposite of Europe.\n\nCraftsmen principally used ormolu for the decorative mountings of furniture, clocks, lighting devices, and porcelain. The great French furniture designers and cabinetmakers, or \"ébénistes\", of the 18th and 19th centuries made maximum use of the exquisite gilt-bronze mounts produced by \"fondeurs-ciseleurs\" (founders and finishers) such as the renowned Jacques Caffieri (1678–1755), whose finished gilt-bronze pieces were almost as fine as jewelers' work. Ormolu mountings attained their highest artistic and technical development in France.\n\nSimilarly fine results could be achieved for lighting devices, such as chandeliers and candelabras, as well as for the ornamental metal mounts applied to clock cases and to ceramic pieces. In the hands of the Parisian \"marchands-merciers\", the precursors of decorators, ormolu or gilt-bronze sculptures were used for bright, non-oxidizing fireplace accessories or for Rococo or Neoclassical mantel-clocks or wall-mounted clock-cases – a specialty of Charles Cressent (1685–1768) – complemented by rock-crystal drops on gilt-bronze chandeliers and wall-lights.\n\nThe bronze mounts were cast by lost wax casting, and then chiseled and chased to add detail. Rococo gilt bronze tends to be finely cast, lightly chiseled, and part-burnished. Neoclassical gilt-bronze is often entirely chiseled and chased with extraordinary skill and delicacy to create finely varied surfaces.\n\nThe ormolu technique was extensively used in the French Empire mantel clocks, reaching its peak during this period.\n\nChinese and European porcelains mounted in gilt-bronze were luxury wares that heightened the impact of often-costly and ornamental ceramic pieces sometimes used for display. Chinese ceramics with gilt-bronze mounts were produced under the guidance of the Parisian \"marchands-merciers\", for only they had access to the ceramics (often purchased in the Netherlands) and the ability to overleap the guild restrictions. A few surviving pieces of 16th-century Chinese porcelain subsequently mounted in contemporary European silver-gilt, or \"vermeil\", show where the foundations of the later fashion lay.\n\nFrom the late 1760s, Matthew Boulton (1728–1809) of Birmingham produced English ormolu vases and perfume-burners in the latest Neoclassical style. Though the venture never became a financial success, it produced the finest English ormolu. In the early 19th century fine English ormolu came from the workshops of Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy (1780–1854).\n\nIn France, the tradition of neoclassic ormolu to Pierre-Philippe Thomire (1751–1843) was continued by Lucien-François Feuchère. Beurdeley & Cie. produced excellent ormolu in Rococo and Neoclassical styles in Paris, and rococo gilt-bronze is characteristic of the furniture of François Linke.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Another priority of Sensoaesthetics is to connect the Materials Science community with other disciplines such as Art and the design world, and reverse a perceived eradication of interest in the sensual and aesthetic properties of materials. \nThe field has been developed by Materials Science academics, Professor Mark Miodownik and Dr Zoe Laughlin at King's College London and UCL, and through the work of the Materials Library at King's College, and the Institute of Making.\n\nThe event was held in May, 2012 at Quilon, a Michelin starred Indian restaurant in London, by Zoe Laughlin and Mark Miodownik. \nThe purpose was to study the taste of solid metals, and involved inviting a group of people including chef Heston Blumenthal and food science writer Harold McGee to eat Indian food using seven different freshly polished spoons in copper, gold, silver, tin, zinc, chrome and stainless steel.\n\nThe tastes of copper and zinc were found to be \"bold and assertive, with bitter, metallic tastes\". The silver spoon \"tasted dull\", while the stainless steel had a \"faintly metallic flavour\". Miodownik observed that the guests were not just tasting the spoons, but eating them, as with every lick they consumed \"perhaps a hundred billion atoms\".\n\nIn 2016, a set of the spoons Laughlin designed were included in the new permanent collection of London's Design Museum and are on display in the Designer Maker User gallery.\n\n"}

Skyscapes differ from cloudscapes because they do not necessarily include clouds. Like cloudscape art, skyscape art can also omit any view of land or anything else which might help to suggest scale or orientation. Images called \"skyscapes\" often do include clouds or land, but these things can also be excluded or kept to a minimum.\n\nThe view may be from earth or from a level far above. There is often nothing to suggest scale in the art, unless a bit of landscape is included or some phenomena such as the depiction of clouds, precipitation, rainbows and aurorae. Some artists also depict birds, insects and other flying objects, as well as manmade aircraft, kites and objects such as leaves, and balloons.\n\nThere are many examples of cloudless skies in painting, printmaking, serigraphy and photography. \n\nWeather is often an important element in the composition of skyscapes.\n\nThe sky is really nothing more than the denser gaseous zone of the earth’s atmosphere. Sky can be depicted as many different colors, such as a pale blue or the lack of any color at all, such as the night sky, which has the appearance of blackness, albeit with a scattering of stars on a clear night. During the day, the sky is seen as a deep blue due to the sunlight reflected on the air.\n\nAstronomically speaking, the sky is a celestial sphere–an imaginary dome divided into constellations–where the moon, planets, stars and sun seem to visually move across the sky.\n\nAlthough artists have long painted the sky it was Edward Hopper who first showed us the beauty of the skyscape, sans clouds. In the 1950s, Eric Sloane painted many cloudless skyscapes during his stay in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nAnother example of a cloudless skyscape artwork is the celestial ceiling mural at Grand Central Terminal in New York City.\n"}
{"id": "83491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83491", "title": "Story within a story", "text": "Story within a story\n\nA story within a story is a literary device in which one character within a narrative narrates. \"Mise en abyme\" is the French term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in heraldry of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: novels, short stories, plays, television programs, films, poems, songs, and philosophical essays. The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story. Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world. When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the reliability of the storyteller are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story. In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded ideas that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of deleted scenes with DVD releases of films. Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.\n\nThe literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a \"frame story\", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or \"frame\" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.\n\nThe earliest examples of \"frame stories\" and \"stories within stories\" were in ancient Egyptian and Indian literature, such as the Egyptian Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor and Indian epics like the \"Ramayana\", \"Seven Wise Masters\", \"Hitopadesha\" and \"Vikram and the Vampire\". In Vishnu Sarma's \"Panchatantra\", an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic \"Mahabharata\", the Kurukshetra War is narrated by a character in Vyasa's \"Jaya\", which itself is narrated by a character in Vaisampayana's \"Bharata\", which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's \"Mahabharata\".\n\nBoth \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius and \"Metamorphoses\" by Ovid extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories. An example of this is \"The Three Apples\", a murder mystery narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a flashback of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an unreliable narrator tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him. As the story concludes, the \"\" is narrated within it. This perennially popular work can be traced back to Arabic, Persian, and Indian storytelling traditions. \n\nMary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes. Similarly, Roald Dahl's story \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\" is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to \"see\" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.\n\nChaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" and Boccacio's Decameron are also classic frame stories. In Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. Homer's \"Odyssey\" too makes use of this device; Odysseus' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king Alcinous in Scheria. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the \"Odyssey\". Many modern children's story collections are essentially anthology works connected by this device, such as Arnold Lobel's \"Mouse Tales\", Paula Fox's \"The Little Swineherd\", and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's \"Ears and Tails and Common Sense\".\n\nA well-known modern example of framing is \"The Princess Bride\" (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of \"The Princess Bride\" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own \"Good Parts Version\" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called \"The Princess Bride\" by a nonexistent author named S. Morgenstern.\nIn the Welsh novel, Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert (1852) by Gwilym Hiraethog a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of Uncle Tom's Cabin to those gathered around the hearth.\n\nSometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", each episode was framed as though it were being told by Indy when he was older (usually acted by George Hall, but once by Harrison Ford). The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Christmas Story\", and the television show \"The Wonder Years\".\n\nIn The Amory Wars, a tale told through the music of Coheed and Cambria, tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.\n\nThe critically acclaimed Beatles album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, \"A Day in the Life\" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the Fugees album \"The Score\" is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable concept albums, while Wyclef Jean's \"The Carnival\" is presented as testimony at a trial. The majority of Ayreon's albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of Janelle Monae.\n\nIn his 1895 historical novel \"Pharaoh\", Bolesław Prus introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from vignettes to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from ancient Egyptian texts, that further the plot, illuminate characters, and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters. Jan Potocki's \"The Manuscript Found in Saragossa\" (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.\n\nThe provenance of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J. R. R. Tolkien, which depicts the Red Book of Westmarch (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The subtitle of \"The Hobbit\" (\"There and Back Again\") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and \"The Lord of the Rings\" is a part of the final title.\n\nAn example of an interconnected inner story is \"The Mad Trist\" in Edgar Allan Poe's \"Fall of the House of Usher\", where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in \"The Mad Trist\" begins happening in \"The Fall of the House of Usher\". Also, in \"Don Quixote\" by Cervantes, there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).\n\nA commonly independently anthologised story is \"The Grand Inquisitor\" by Dostoevsky from his long psychological novel \"The Brothers Karamazov\", which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.\n\nAn example of a \"bonus material\" style inner story is the chapter \"The Town Ho's Story\" in Herman Melville's novel \"Moby-Dick\"; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting mutiny and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing \"Moby-Dick\"—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to create and develop. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by telling the story to his impressed friends. \n\nWith the rise of literary modernism, writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is James Merrill's 1974 modernist poem \"Lost in Translation\".\n\nIn Rabih Alameddine's novel \"The Hakawati\", or \"The Storyteller\", the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.\n\nIn Sue Townsend's \"\", Adrian writes a book entitled \"Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland\", in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called \"Sparg of Kronk\", whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.\n\nDreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep. Both the book \"The Arabian Nightmare\" and the curse of \"eternal waking\" from the Neil Gaiman series \"The Sandman\" feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream. In Charles Maturin's novel \"Melmoth the Wanderer\", the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.\n\nThis structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts. The structure of \"The Symposium\" and \"Phaedo\", attributed to Plato, is of a story within a story within a story. In the Christian Bible, the gospels are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of Jesus. However, they also include within them the stories (parables) that Jesus told. In more modern philosophical work, Jostein Gaarder's books often feature this device. Examples are \"The Solitaire Mystery\", where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and \"Sophie's World\" about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.\n\nThe experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced. These include most of the various novels written by the American author Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut includes the recurring character Kilgore Trout in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious science fiction writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\" are sprinkled with these plot descriptions. Stanisław Lem's \"Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius\" from \"The Cyberiad\" has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl. \n\n\"House of Leaves\" is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. \n\nRobert A. Heinlein's later books (\"The Number of the Beast\", \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" and \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\") propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This hypothesis enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations. Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Blind Assassin\" is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a science fiction story written by one of \"that\" novel's characters. \n\nIn Philip K. Dick's novel \"The Man in the High Castle\", each character comes into interaction with a book called \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the Axis Powers of World War II had succeeded in dominating the known world, the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history. \n\nIn \"Red Orc's Rage\" by Philip J. Farmer a doubly recursive method is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the \"World of Tiers\". Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.\n\nThe \"Quantum Leap\" novel \"Knights Of The Morningstar\" also features a character who writes a book by that name. In Matthew Stover's novel \"Shatterpoint\", the protagonist Mace Windu narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the third-person limited point of view. \n\nSeveral \"Star Trek\" tales are stories or events within stories, such as Gene Roddenberry's novelization of \"\", J. A. Lawrence's \"Mudd's Angels\", John M. Ford's \"The Final Reflection\", Margaret Wander Bonanno's \"Strangers from the Sky\" (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's \"Research\" in the anthology \" II\". Steven Barnes's novelization of \"Far Beyond the Stars\" partners with Greg Cox's \"\" (Volume Two) to tell us that the story \"Far Beyond the Stars\"—and, by extension, all of \"Star Trek\" itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.\n\nThe book \"Cloud Atlas\" (later adapted into a film by The Wachowkis and Tom Tykwer) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that \"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future.\"\n\n\"The Crying of Lot 49\" by Thomas Pynchon has several characters seeing a play called \"The Courier's Tragedy\" by the fictitious Jacobean playwright Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in \"Hamlet\", the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls. A significant portion of Walter Moers' \"Labyrinth of Dreaming Books\" is an ekphrasis on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation. Another example is found in Samuel Delany's \"Trouble on Triton\", which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences. Plays produced by the \"Caws of Art\" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, The Mouse and His Child.\n\nIn Manuel Puig's \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\", ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative. In Paul Russell's \"Boys of Life\", descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director Pier Paulo Pasolini) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative. They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.\n\nThis dramatic device was probably first used by Thomas Kyd in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action. From references in other contemporary works, Kyd is also assumed to have been the writer of an early, lost version of \"Hamlet\" (the so-called \"Ur-Hamlet\"), with a play-within-a-play interlude. William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" retains this device by having Hamlet ask some strolling players to perform the \"Murder of Gonzago\". The action and characters in \"The Murder\" mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying \"the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\" Hamlet calls this new play \"The Mouse-trap\" (a title that Agatha Christie later took for the long-running play \"The Mousetrap\"). The play \"I Hate Hamlet\" and the movie \"A Midwinter's Tale\" are about a production of \"Hamlet\", which in turn includes a production of \"The Murder of Gonzago\", as does the Hamlet-based film \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\" which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" there are specific allusions to \"Hamlet\": in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.\n\nShakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"and \"Love's Labours Lost\". Almost the whole of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince Christopher Sly, a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her \"lord\" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" is about the production of a fictitious musical, \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" based on the Shakespeare play of the same name, and features several scenes from it. \"Pericles\" draws in part on the 14th century \"Confessio Amantis\" (itself a frame story) by John Gower and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower \"assume man's infirmities\" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play. \n\nIn Francis Beaumont's \"Knight of the Burning Pestle\" (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a \"planted\" actor, condemns the play that has just started and \"persuades\" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's \"apprentice\" then acts, pretending to extemporise, in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.\n\nThe opera \"Pagliacci\" is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer Richard Rodney Bennett and playwright-librettist Beverley Cross's \"The Mines of Sulphur\" features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' \"Nixon in China\" (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's \"Red Detachment of Women\" to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.\n\nIn Bertolt Brecht's \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle,\" a play is staged as a parable to villagers in the Soviet Union to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an \"'induction'\". Brecht's one-act play \"The Elephant Calf\" (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his \"Man Equals Man\".\n\nIn Jean Giraudoux's play \"Ondine\", all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the dramatic tension and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the mortal Hans and water sprite Ondine.\n\n\"The Two-Character Play\" by Tennessee Williams has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.\n\n\"The Mysteries\", a modern reworking of the medieval mystery plays, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.\n\nAlternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in \"Noises Off\", \"A Chorus of Disapproval\" or \"Lilies\". Similarly, the musical \"Man of La Mancha\" presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by \"Quixote\"'s author, Miguel de Cervantes.\n\nIn most stagings of the musical \"Cats\", which include the song \"Growltiger's Last Stand\" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady Griddlebone sings \"The Ballad of Billy McCaw\". (However, many productions of the show omit \"Growltiger's Last Stand\", and \"The Ballad of Billy McCaw\" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In \"\", there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.\n\nA play within a play also occurs in the musical \"The King and I\", where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of \"Small House of Uncle Thomas\" (or \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\") to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.\n\nIn stagings of Dina Rubina's play \"Always the Same Dream\", the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by Pushkin.\n\nJoseph Heller's 1967 play \"We Bombed in New Haven\" is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.\n\nThe 1937 musical Babes in Arms is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money. The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. A similar plot was recycled for the films White Christmas and The Blues Brothers.\n\nTV Tropes maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device. \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as \"Mabel's Dramatic Career\" (1913).\n\nThe François Truffaut film \"Day for Night\" is about the making of a fictitious movie called \"Meet Pamela\" (\"Je vous présente Pamela\") and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of \"Pamela\" involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in \"Day for Night\". There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film. These include the darkly satirical classic \"Sunset Boulevard\" about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce \"Hail, Caesar!\"\n\nThe script to Karel Reisz's movie \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981), written by Harold Pinter, is a film-within-a-film adaptation of John Fowles's book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.\n\nIn Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock, Jr.\", Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the Arnold Schwarzenegger children's film \"The Last Action Hero\". A similar device is used in the seminal music video \"Take on me\" by A-ha, which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, Woody Allen's \"Purple Rose of Cairo\" is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world. Allen's earlier film \"Play it Again, Sam\" featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic \"Casablanca\" as a central device.\n\nThe 2002 Pedro Almodóvar film \"Talk to Her\" (\"Hable con ella\") has the chief character Benigno tell a story called \"The Shrinking Lover\" to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents \"The Shrinking Lover\" in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, \"The Shrinking Lover\" protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of \"Talk to Her\"—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that \"The Shrinking Lover\" essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in \"Talk to Her,\" the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. \"The Shrinking Lover\" was named Best Scene of 2002 in the \"Skandies\", an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.\n\n\"Tropic Thunder\" (2008) is a comedy film revolving around a group of prima donna actors making a Vietnam War film (itself also named \"Tropic Thunder\") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out. The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy Three Amigos, where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies. The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the Star Trek parody Galaxy Quest.\n\nThe first episode of the anime series \"The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya\" consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with Kyon's typical, sarcastic commentary.\n\nChuck Jones's 1953 cartoon \"Duck Amuck\" shows Daffy Duck trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by Bugs Bunny. The \"Duck Amuck\" plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, \"Rabbit Rampage\" (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd). A similar plot was also included in an episode of \"Baby Looney Tunes\", in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the \"Duck Amuck\" sequence was parodied on \"Drawn Together\" (\"Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care\").\n\nAll feature-length films by Jörg Buttgereit except \"Schramm\" feature a film within the film. In \"Nekromantik\", the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film \"Vera\". In \"Der Todesking\" one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film \"Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo\" and in \"Nekromantik 2\", the characters go to see a movie called \"Mon dejeuner avec Vera\" which is a parody of Louis Malle's \"My Dinner with André\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" depicts a Nazi propaganda film called \"Nation's Pride\", which glorifies a soldier in the German army. \"Nation's Pride\" is directed by Eli Roth.\n\nJoe Dante's \"Matinee\" depicts \"Mant\", an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an ant. In one scene, the protagonists see a Disney-style family movie called \"The Shook-Up Shopping Cart\".\n\nThe 2002 martial arts epic Hero presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences. Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 Terry Gilliam film The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and the 2003 Tim Burton film Big Fish, the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator. In the 2006 Tarsem film \"The Fall\", an injured silent-movie stuntman tells heroic fantasy stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's \"present-tense\" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to \"Indians,\" “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle. The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama The Usual Suspects (which garnered an Oscar for Kevin Spacey's performance).\n\nThe seminal 1950 Japanese film \"Rashomon\", based on the Japanese short story \"In a Grove\" (1921), utilizes the flashback-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered samurai, his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.\n\nThe movie \"Inception\" has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams. Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the Michael Jackson song \"Thriller\", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream. The film \"Grand Budapest Hotel\" has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.\n\nThe 2001 film \"Moulin Rouge!\" features a fictitious musical within a film, called \"Spectacular Spectacular\". The 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy \"To Be or Not to Be\" confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, \"The Naughty Nazis\", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. \"Hamlet\" also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. Laurence Olivier sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of \"Henry V\" in the tiring room of the old Globe Theatre as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these \"stage\" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the Battle of Agincourt. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe. Mel Brook's film, \"The Producers\", revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, \"Springtime For Hitler.\" Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The Outkast music video for the song \"Roses\" is a short film about a high school musical.\n\nThe main plot device in \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\" is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.\n\nIn \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\", the middle-schoolers put on a play of \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe 1990 biopic Korczak, about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of Rabindranath Tagore's \"The Post Office\", which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death. That same production is also featured in the stage play \"Korczak's Children,\" also inspired by the same historical events.\n\nThe 1973 film adaptation of Peter Nichols's 1969 play, \"The National Health\" features a send-up of a typical American hospital soap-opera being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably British NHS hospital.\n\nThe Jim Carey film The Truman Show is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.\n\nThe first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly Tim Stryker's 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame. Another early use of this trope was in Cliff Johnson's 1987 hit The Fool's Errand, a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.\n\n\"Power Factor\" has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a \"Virtual Reality Simulator\", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace. The \".hack\" franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and Haseo try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.\n\nMore commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the \"Yakuza\" and \"Shenmue\" franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy VII\" there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In \"Animal Crossing\", the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a Nintendo Entertainment System. In \"Fallout 4\", the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.\n\nIn the Remedy video game title \"Max Payne\" players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are \"Lords & Ladies\", \"Captain Baseball Bat Boy\", \"\" and the pinnacle television serial \"Address Unknown\" -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly \"Twin Peaks\", Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.\n\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.\n\n\"Terrance & Phillip\" from \"South Park\" comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, \"The Simpsons\", Bart's favorite cartoon, \"Itchy and Scratchy\" (a parody of \"Tom & Jerry\"), often echoes the plotlines of the main show. \"The Simpsons\" also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\".\n\nOn the show \"Dear White People\", the \"Scandal\" parody \"Defamation\" offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships. Similarly, on the HBO show \"Insecure\" the slavery-era soap opera \"Due North\" is an obsession for the show's main characters.\n\nThe Irish television series \"Father Ted\" features a television show, \"Father Ben\", which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.\n\nThe television shows \"30 Rock\", \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\", \"Sonny with a Chance\", and \"Kappa Mikey\" feature a sketch show within the TV show.\n\nAn extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom \"Seinfeld\" dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives. The gag was reprised on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", another semi-autobiographical show by and about \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated \"Seinfeld\" reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.\n\nThe \"USS Callister\" episode of the \"Black Mirror\" anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.\n\nThe concept of a film within a television series is employed in the Macross universe. \"\" (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" (1982), but was later \"retconned\" into the Macross canon as a popular movie within the television series \"Macross 7\" (1994).\n\n\"Seinfeld\" had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably \"Rochelle, Rochelle\", a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller \"Death Castle\" is a central element of the \"Master of None\" episode \"New York, I Love You.\"\n\nStories inside stories can allow for genre changes. Arthur Ransome uses the device to let his young characters in the \"Swallows and Amazons series\" of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, \"Peter Duck\" and \"Missee Lee\" (and some would include \"Great Northern?\" as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters. Similarly, the film version of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" uses a story within a story format to tell a purely fantastic fairy tale within a relatively more realistic frame-story. The film version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream. Lewis Carroll's celebrated \"Alice\" books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known \"Sylvie and Bruno\" subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the \"real\" world.\nSome stories feature what might be called a literary version of the Droste effect, where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many fractals). Among the stories that include versions of themselves are Neil Gaiman's \"\" which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including \"Cerements\" (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in Charlie Kaufman's 2008 film \"Synecdoche, New York\", the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world. The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.\n\nThe long-running musical A Chorus Line dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members. The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.\n\nMichael Ende's classic children's novel The Neverending Story prominently features a book of the same title. This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element. Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy Stranger than Fiction the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.\n\nIn Douglas Hofstadter's \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", there is a narrative between Achilles and the Tortoise (characters borrowed from Lewis Carroll, who in turn borrowed them from Zeno), and within this story they find a book entitled \"Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe\", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled \"Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe\", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.\n\nThe music video for the Björk song \"Bachelorette\" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.\n\nEpisode 14 of the anime series \"Martian Successor Nadesico\" is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on \"Gekigangar III\", an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a paradox.\n\n\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by Steven Spielberg. Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film Pee-Wee's Big Adventure ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with James Brolin as a more stereotypically manly version of the Paul Reubens title character. Mel Brooks's 1974 comedy \"Blazing Saddles\" leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the Warner Bros. studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at Grauman's Chinese Theater, which is showing the \"premiere\" of \"Blazing Saddles\"; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film. Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 \"Star Wars\" parody, \"Spaceballs\", where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release). Brooks also made the 1976 parody \"Silent Movie\" about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated \"The Artist\").\n\nIn the latter two films of the \"Scream\" horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In \"Scream 2\", characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first \"Scream\" film, while in \"Scream 3\" the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest \"Scream\" movie, \"Scream 4\", in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving time travel as a plot device.\n\nDirector Spike Jonze's \"Adaptation\" is a fictionalized version of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book \"The Orchid Thief\" into a Hollywood blockbuster. As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of \"Being John Malkovich\", previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.) Robert Altman's satirical noir \"The Player\" about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.\n\nOccasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a spin-off.\n\nIn the fictional world of the \"Toy Story\" movies, Buzz Lightyear is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\", which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within \"Toy Story\". Later, \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\" was produced in the real world.\n\n\"Kujibiki Unbalance\", a series in the \"Genshiken\" universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.\n\nSuch spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the \"Harry Potter\" series, three such supplemental books have been produced. \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" is a textbook used by the main character, and \"Quidditch Through the Ages\" is a book from the library at his school. \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.\n\nIn the works of Kurt Vonnegut, Kilgore Trout has written a novel called \"Venus on the Half-Shell\". In 1975 real-world author Philip José Farmer wrote a science-fiction novel called \"Venus on the Half-Shell\", published under the name Kilgore Trout.\n\nIn \"Homestuck\" by Andrew Hussie, there is a comic called Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.\n\n\"Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth\", a story by Dean Wesley Smith, was adapted from the holonovel \"Captain Proton\" in the Star Trek universe.\n\nIn the animated online franchise \"Homestar Runner\" many of the best-known features were spun off from each other. The best known was \"Strong Bad Emails,\" which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody \"Teen Girl Squad\" and the anime parody \"20X6.\"\n\nOne unique example is the Tyler Perry comedy/horror hit \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the Chris Rock film \"Top 5\".\n\n"}

Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of dramatic monologue, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in poetry and drama, but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary. It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a tragedy. The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist Bryan Lewis Saunders in 2005. For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a malapropism for the stream of consciousness.\n\nThe audio recordings of Dion McGregor (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such. \"Dreams\" (1995) by contemporary American artist Jim Shaw is a collection of illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions. \"Experiment with Dreams\" by Leif Elggren and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.\n\nExamples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:\n\n"}

Repeatedly the winner of international competitions, he left behind thousands of images with this technique. His works have adorned calendars, business cards, notepads, postcards and other items.\n\nPolish wycinanki became a popular folk craft in the mid-1800s.\n\nWycinanki originated with shepherds cutting designs out of tree bark and leather. Colorful wycinanki were pasted on furniture or roof beams as decoration, hung in windows, and given as gifts.\n\nWycinanki vary by region. For example, wycinanki created in the Kurpie region are typically all one color, while wycinanki from the Łowicz region are multicolored. Techniques include cutting, clipping, punching, tearing, and carving of paper, as well as \"nalepianki\" in which multiple layers are glued together.\n\nSubject matter includes peacocks, roosters, and other birds; circular or star-shaped medallions (\"gwiazdy\"); flowers; and annual holidays such as Easter and Christmas. In some towns and villages competitions evolved to create the most beautiful wycinanki. Traditionally done for relaxation in rural Poland, the techniques were passed down through generations, with new themes and ideas developing as the papercuttings became more detailed and intricate.\n\nThe Polish Pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai is based on a wycinanki design.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that vytynanky began to be made in Ukraine at the end of the fifteenth to early sixteenth century, but it took quite some time before they became an integral part of the decorative arts practiced at the grass roots level. During the nineteenth century decorative paper cutouts spread all across the Ukrainian countryside.\n\nThe word itself, vytynanky, gained currency in the early twentieth century, but there were many other, regional words that were used too — stryhuntsi, khrestyky or kvity to mention but a few. The vytynanky shapes were of many kinds and represented stylized figures of people, animals and plants. Ethnographers and art historians began to study the art of vytynanky, and artists began to seek inspiration for their art in vytynanky. Articles and essays were published, vytynanky began to be collected. Vytynanky were displayed at exhibitions of the Ukrainian decorative and applied arts alongside traditional pottery, embroidery, rugs and other items.\n\nVytynanky that were made for the occasions of religious feasts and holidays were more decorative than the ones used for everyday decoration. Christmas and Easter called for vytynanky in the shapes of angels, churches or even whole evangelical scenes to be pasted prominently on the walls. Marriages saw vytynanky in the shapes of doves, flowers, or the ones that formed “trees of life.”\n\n"}
{"id": "28557692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28557692", "title": "Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman", "text": "Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman\n\nIn Carl Jung's theory of analytical psychology, the Wise Old Woman and the Wise Old Man are archetypes of the Collective Unconscious. 'The \"wise old woman\"...[or] helpful \"old woman\" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'. The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity' is her male counterpart.\n\nIn Jung's thought, the individuation process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'. Thus, starting with the intermediate position of 'anima or animus...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the shadow, so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior' still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed \"Mana\" personalities or \"supraordinate\" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the \"mother\" (\"Primordial Mother\" and \"Earth Mother\") as a supraordinary personality...as the \"self\"'.\n\nAs von Franz put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian \"guru\"), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.\n\nThe masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'. Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by Hecate or the Crone ...the Great Mother' stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'. Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore \"for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality\"'.\n\nIn Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'. Thus 'the \"good Wise Man\" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure', and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the \"terrible mother\"'. Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'. \n\nBut judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the \"supraordinate personality\", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'. Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a \"coniunctio oppositorum\", a union of opposites. 'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'. Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.\n\nComing to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic splitting, so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.\n\n"}
