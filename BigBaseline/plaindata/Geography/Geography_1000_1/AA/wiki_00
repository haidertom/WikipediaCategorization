It serves as a valuable handbook on oceanography and meteorology, and contains useful tables and a maritime glossary. In 1867 the copyright and plates were bought by the Hydrographic Office of the United States Navy, and as a U.S. Government publication, it is now available free online. It is considered one of America's nautical institutions.\n\nThe most popular navigational text of the late 18th century was \"The New Practical Navigator\" by John Hamilton Moore of the Royal Navy, first published in 1772. To have exact tables to work from, Bowditch recomputed all of Moore's tables, and rearranged and expanded the work. He contacted the US publisher of the work, Edmund March Blunt, who asked him to correct and revise the third edition on his fifth voyage. The task was so extensive that Bowditch decided to write his own book, and to \"put down in the book nothing I can't teach the crew.\" On that trip, it is said that every man of the crew of 12, including the ship's cook, became competent to take and calculate lunar observations and to plot the correct position of the ship. \"The New Practical Navigator\" was published in 1799, followed by a second edition in 1800.\n\nBy 1802, when Blunt was ready to publish a third edition, Nathaniel Bowditch and others had corrected so many errors in Moore's work that Blunt decided to publish it as the first edition of a new work, \"The New American Practical Navigator\". The current edition of the \"American Practical Navigator\" traces its pedigree to that 1802 edition. Edmund M. Blunt continued to publish the book until 1833; upon his retirement, his sons, Edmund and George, assumed publication. The elder Blunt died in 1862; his son Edmund followed in 1866. The next year, 1867, George Blunt sold the copyright to the government for $25,000. The government has published \"Bowditch\" ever since. George Blunt died in 1878.\n\nNathaniel Bowditch continued to correct and revise the book until his death in 1838. Upon his death, the editorial responsibility for \"The New American Practical Navigator\" passed to his son, J. Ingersoll Bowditch. Very few significant changes were made under him. Editions from 1837 through 1880 are nearly identical in content. Ingersoll Bowditch continued editing the \"Navigator\" until George Blunt sold the copyright to the government. He outlived all of the principals involved in publishing and editing the \"Navigator\", dying in 1889.\n\nThe U.S. government has published some 52 editions since acquiring the copyright to the book that has come to be known simply by its original author’s name, \"Bowditch\". Since the government began production, the book has been known by its year of publishing, instead of by the edition number. After the first major revision, a total overhaul of the book's content completed in 1880 under the direction of Commander Philip H. Cooper, USN, the name was changed to \"American Practical Navigator\". Much of Bowditch’s original content, including his methods for clearing lunar distance observations, were dropped in 1880 (though a new method for clearing lunars remained in an appendix until the early 20th century). After numerous incremental revisions and printings in the period from 1914 to 1944, \"Bowditch\" was extensively revised between 1946 and 1958.\nThe present volume, while retaining the basic format of the 1958 version, reorganizes the subjects, deletes obsolete text, and adds new material to keep pace with the extensive changes in navigation that have taken place in the electronic age.\n\nThe 1995 edition of the \"American Practical Navigator\" incorporates extensive changes in organization, content, and format. Recent advances in navigational electronics, communications, positioning, and other technologies have transformed the way navigation is practiced at sea, and it is clear that even more changes are forthcoming. The changes to this edition of \"Bowditch\" are intended to ensure that this publication remains the premier reference work for practical marine navigation. Concerted efforts were made to return to Nathaniel Bowditch’s original intention \"to put down in the book nothing I can’t teach the crew.\" To this end, many complex formulas and equations have been eliminated, and emphasis placed on the capabilities and limitations of various navigation systems and how to use them, instead of explaining complex technical and theoretical details. This edition replaces but does not cancel former editions, which may be retained and consulted as to navigation methods not discussed herein.\nCurrent edition (as of June 2017) is Edition 53, a two-volume, all-digital version released by NGA in 2017.\n\nThe Bicentennial Edition (2002) incorporated Volume 1 and Volume 2 into a single printed volume, with the goal of putting as much useful information before the navigator as possible in the most understandable and readable format, a single, hard-bound volume. While that edition saw widespread use in civilian, military and commercial fleets, it sacrificed some data on classical celestial navigation and on advances in satellite and electronic navigation to meet the compressed requirements of the physical form factor. Twenty years later, with a resurgence in interest on celestial navigation and the large-scale adoption of electronic navigation, NGA returned Pub No. 9 to a two-volume format to encompass the expanded material. To eliminate printing costs, NGA does not intend to produce a physical version of the 2017 edition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortions of this article originated from the preface of \"The American Practical Navigator\", a document produced by the government of the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The instrument was patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born geologist named David W. Brunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit utilizes magnetic induction damping rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation. Although Brunton, Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make accurate navigational and slope-angle measurements in the field. Users are primarily geologists, but archaeologists, environmental engineers, mining engineers and surveyors also make use of the Brunton's capabilities. The United States Army has adopted the Pocket Transit as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served artillery.\n\nThe Pocket Transit may be adjusted for declination angle according to one's location on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements (azimuth) through use of the Earth's magnetic field. Holding the compass at waist-height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line that is on the mirror. Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made. Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the strike and dip of geological features (faults, contacts, foliation, sedimentary strata, etc.). Strike is measured by leveling (with the bull's eye level) the compass along the plane being measured. Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made. If field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance.\n\nAs with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in reference to the Earth's magnetic field. Thus, measurements are sensitive to magnetic intereference. For example, if the user is near an outcrop that contains magnetite or some other iron-bearing material, compass readings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the outcrop to tens of yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field). Since they are measured with a rotating level, dip measurements are unaffected by magnetic interference.\n\nThere are numerous other compasses used by geologists: The Breithaupt compass is one example. Portable electronic devices are changing the way geologists conduct field work. Unlike analogue compasses, a digital compass relies on an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and may provide information about the reliability of a measurement (e.g. by repeating the same measurement and performing statistical analysis).\n\n\n"}

A cadastral community records property ownership in a cadastre, which is a register describing property ownership by boundary lines of the real estate.\n\nThe common etymology in the Central European successor states of the Habsburg Monarchy comes from (KG), plural: \"Katastralgemeinden\", translated as \n\nIn 1764, at the behest of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, a complete survey of the Habsburg lands was begun, initiated by the general staff of the Imperial and Royal Army under Field Marshal Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, who had become aware of the lack of reliable maps in the Seven Years' War. Maria Theresa's son Emperor Joseph II ordered the implication of a complete urbarium for property tax purposes in 1785. The present-day cadastre was completed after the Napoleonic Wars from 1817 onwards under Emperor Francis I of Austria (\"Franziszeischer Kataster\"). Since then, the Austrian (i.e. Cisleithanian) crown lands were subdivided in \"Katastralgemeinden\"; surveying in the Hungarian (Transleithanian) lands started in 1850. Municipalities as administrative subdivisions with certain rights of self-governance were not established until after the 1848 revolutions.\n\nMost of the nowadays \"Katastralgemeinden\" once had been independent communes and were incorporated on the occasion of a municipal territory reforms. They can be further divided into smaller villages and localities (\"Ortschaften\"). there are 7,847 Katastralgemeinden in Austria. For land registration, the unit identifier used in a \"Katastralgemeinde\" is \"KG-Nr\" (KG-Nummer, or number).\n\nThe Dutch system of \"kadastrale gemeenten\" was set up around 1830. When municipalities are merged, often the cadastral communes remain as they were, so one civil municipality can consist of more than one cadastral commune; but again, a cadastral commune can never be part of more than one civil municipality.\n\n\n"}

There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with stad-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns (köping) 60 to 79 and rural municipalities 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.\n\nAs part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved.

The primary function of this technology is to produce maps that give accurate representations of a particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.\n\nAlthough digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer applications the main use of these maps is with the Global Positioning System, or GPS satellite network, used in standard automotive navigation systems.\n\nThe roots of digital mapping lie within traditional paper maps such as the Thomas Guide and Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas. Paper maps provide basic landscapes similar to digitized road maps, yet are often cumbersome, cover only a designated area, and lack many specific details such as road blocks. In addition, there is no way to “update” a paper map except to obtain a new version. On the other hand, digital maps, in many cases, can be updated through synchronization with updates from company servers.\n\nEarly digital maps had the same basic functionality as paper maps—that is, they provided a “virtual view” of roads generally outlined by the terrain encompassing the surrounding area. However, as digital maps have grown with the expansion of GPS technology in the past decade, live traffic updates, points of interest and service locations have been added to enhance digital maps to be more “user conscious.\" Traditional “virtual views” are now only part of digital mapping. In many cases, users can choose between virtual maps, satellite (aerial views), and hybrid (a combination of virtual map and aerial views) views. With the ability to update and expand digital mapping devices, newly constructed roads and places can be added to appear on maps. Three-dimensional maps of landscapes can be generated using 3D scanners or 3D reconstruction software.\n\nDigital maps heavily rely upon a vast amount of data collected over time. Most of the information that comprise digital maps is the culmination of satellite imagery as well as street level information. Maps must be updated frequently to provide users with the most accurate reflection of a location. While there is a wide spectrum on companies that specialize in digital mapping, the basic premise is that digital maps will accurately portray roads as they actually appear to give \"life-like experiences.\" \n\nProprietary and non-proprietary computer programs and applications provide imagery and street-level map data for much of the world.\n\nThe development of mobile computing (PDAs, tablet PCs, laptops, etc.) has recently (since about 2000) spurred the use of digital mapping in the sciences and applied sciences. , science fields that use digital mapping technology include geology (see Digital geologic mapping), engineering, architecture, land surveying, mining, forestry, environmental, and archaeology.\n\nThe principal use by which digital mapping has grown in the past decade has been its connection to Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. GPS is the foundation behind digital mapping navigation systems.\n\nThe coordinates and position as well as atomic time obtained by a terrestrial GPS receiver from GPS satellites orbiting Earth interact together to provide the digital mapping programming with points of origin in addition to the destination points needed to calculate distance. This information is then analyzed and compiled to create a map that provides the easiest and most efficient way to reach a destination.\n\n"}

Due to the equatorial bulge, the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have, respectively, the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance.\n\nGIS or geographic information system is a computer system that allows for visualizing, manipulating, capturing, and storage of data with associated attributes. GIS offers better understanding of patterns and relationships of the landscape at different scales. Tools inside the GIS allow for manipulation of data for spatial analysis or cartography.\nA topographical map is the main type of map used to depict elevation, often through use of contour lines.\nIn a Geographic Information System (GIS), digital elevation models (DEM) are commonly used to represent the surface (topography) of a place, through a raster (grid) dataset of elevations. Digital terrain models are another way to represent terrain in GIS.\n\nUSGS (United States Geologic Survey) is developing a 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) to keep up with growing needs for high quality topographic data. 3DEP is a collection of enhanced elevation data in the form of high quality LiDAR data over the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories. There are three bare earth DEM layers in 3DEP which are nationally seamless at the resolution of 1/3, 1, and 2 arcseconds.\n\nThis map is derived from GTOPO30 data that describes the elevation of Earth's terrain at intervals of 30 arcseconds (approximately 1 km). It uses color and shading instead of contour lines to indicate elevation.\n\nHypsography is the study of the distribution of elevations on the surface of the Earth, although the term is sometimes also applied to other rocky planets such as Mars or Venus. The term originates from the Greek word \"hypsos\" meaning height. Most often it is used only in reference to elevation of land but a complete description of Earth's solid surface requires a description of the seafloor as well. Related to the term hypsometry, the measurement of these elevations of a planet's solid surface are taken relative to mean datum, except for Earth which is taken relative to the sea level.\nIn the troposphere, temperatures decrease with altitude. This lapse rate is approximately 6.5 °C/km.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74263", "title": "Frame of reference", "text": "Frame of reference\n\nIn physics, a frame of reference (or reference frame) consists of an abstract coordinate system and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.\n\nIn n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.\n\nIn Einsteinian relativity, reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes \"observational frame of reference\" (or \"observational reference frame\"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its origin. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the coordinate time, which does not correspond across different frames moving relatively to each other. The situation thus differs from Galilean relativity, where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.\n\nThe need to distinguish between the various meanings of \"frame of reference\" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in \"Cartesian frame of reference\". Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in \"rotating frame of reference\". Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in \"Galilean frame of reference\". Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in \"macroscopic\" and \"microscopic frames of reference\".\n\nIn this article, the term \"observational frame of reference\" is used when emphasis is upon the \"state of motion\" rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a \"coordinate system\" may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs \"generalized coordinates\", \"normal modes\" or \"eigenvectors\", which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:\n\n\n\nHere is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames formula_1 and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [\"R\", \"R′\", \"etc.\"]:\nand this on the utility of separating the notions of formula_1 and [\"R\", \"R′\", \"etc.\"]:\n\nand this, also on the distinction between formula_1 and [\"R\", \"R′\", \"etc.\"]:\n\nand from J. D. Norton:\n\nThe discussion is taken beyond simple space-time coordinate systems by Brading and Castellani. Extension to coordinate systems using generalized coordinates underlies the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of quantum field theory, classical relativistic mechanics, and quantum gravity.\n\nAlthough the term \"coordinate system\" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term \"coordinate system\" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.\n\nA coordinate system in mathematics is a facet of geometry or of algebra, in particular, a property of manifolds (for example, in physics, configuration spaces or phase spaces). The coordinates of a point r in an \"n\"-dimensional space are simply an ordered set of \"n\" numbers: \nIn a general Banach space, these numbers could be (for example) coefficients in a functional expansion like a Fourier series. In a physical problem, they could be spacetime coordinates or normal mode amplitudes. In a robot design, they could be angles of relative rotations, linear displacements, or deformations of joints. Here we will suppose these coordinates can be related to a Cartesian coordinate system by a set of functions:\n\nwhere \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"etc.\" are the \"n\" Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions, coordinate surfaces are defined by the relations:\nThe intersection of these surfaces define coordinate lines. At any selected point, tangents to the intersecting coordinate lines at that point define a set of basis vectors {e, e, …, e} at that point. That is:\n\nwhich can be normalized to be of unit length. For more detail see curvilinear coordinates.\n\nCoordinate surfaces, coordinate lines, and basis vectors are components of a coordinate system. If the basis vectors are orthogonal at every point, the coordinate system is an orthogonal coordinate system.\n\nAn important aspect of a coordinate system is its metric tensor \"g\", which determines the arc length \"ds\" in the coordinate system in terms of its coordinates:\n\nwhere repeated indices are summed over.\n\nAs is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a mathematical construct, part of an axiomatic system. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, Lorentz transformations and Galilean transformations may be viewed as coordinate transformations.\n\nGeneral and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the See also links below.\n\nAn observational frame of reference, often referred to as a \"physical frame of reference\", a \"frame of reference\", or simply a \"frame\", is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized \"only by its state of motion\". However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an \"observer\" and a \"frame\". According to this view, a \"frame\" is an \"observer\" plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran. This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity. In general relativity the use of general coordinate systems is common (see, for example, the Schwarzschild solution for the gravitational field outside an isolated sphere).\n\nThere are two types of observational reference frame: inertial and non-inertial. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In special relativity these frames are related by Lorentz transformations, which are parametrized by rapidity. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that Newton's first law holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a free particle travels in a straight line at constant speed, or is at rest. These frames are related by Galilean transformations. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of representations of the Poincaré group and of the Galilean group.\n\nIn contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which fictitious forces must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the Coriolis force, centrifugal force, and gravitational force. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)\n\nA further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the measurement apparatus (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in quantum mechanics, where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see measurement problem).\n\nIn physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the laboratory frame or simply \"lab frame.\" An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the center of momentum frame \"COM frame\" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.\n\nIn this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect metrology that is connected to the nature of the vacuum, and uses atomic clocks that operate according to the standard model and that must be corrected for gravitational time dilation. (See second, meter and kilogram).\n\nIn fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.\n\n\nConsider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious \"frames of reference\" that we could choose.\n\nFirst, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our \"frame of reference\" \"S\" as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance \"d\" = 200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where formula_12 is the position in meters of car one after time \"t\" in seconds and formula_13 is the position of car two after time \"t\".\n\nNotice that these formulas predict at \"t\" = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which formula_15. Therefore, we set formula_15 and solve for formula_17, that is:\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a frame of reference \"S′\" situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of . In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of , that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.\n\nIt would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).\n\nFor a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south. For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right. However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left. This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.\n\nFor a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right. In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis. To him, the car moves along the \"x\" axis with some velocity \"v\" in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an inertial frame of reference because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).\n\nNow consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive \"x\"-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive \"y\"-axis. In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity \"v\" in the negative \"y\"-direction. If she is driving north, then north is the positive \"y\"-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive \"y\"-direction.\n\nFinally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car. As she passes by him, Alfred measures her acceleration and finds it to be \"a\" in the negative x-direction. Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure? If Betsy's velocity \"v\" is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, \"a\" in the negative \"y\"-direction. However, if she is accelerating at rate \"A\" in the negative \"y\"-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be \"a′\" = \"a\" − \"A\" in the negative \"y\"-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured. Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate \"A\" in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as \"a′\" = \"a\" + \"A\" in the negative \"y\"-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.\n\nFrames of reference are especially important in special relativity, because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.\n\nIt is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a \"universal\" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his special theory of relativity (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression (Lorentz transformations).\n\nIt is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but general relativity uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the geometry of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a \"free\" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a geodesic path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both \"free\" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as spacetime. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.\n\nHere the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.\n\nAn accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the \"primed\" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. \"x′\", \"y′\", \"a′\".\n\nThe vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as R. Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called r, and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called r′.\nFrom the geometry of the situation, we get\nTaking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain\nwhere V and A are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system and v and a are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.\n\nThese equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write Newton's second law as\n\nWhen there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in centrifugal direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the Coriolis effect).\n\nA common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see Fictitious force for a derivation):\n\nor, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,\n\nMultiplying through by the mass \"m\" gives\nwhere\n\n\n"}

Android based devices support geo URIs, although that implementation is based on a draft revision of the specification, and supports a different set of URI parameters and query strings.\n\nA geo URI is not to be confused with the site GeoUrl (which implements ICBM address).\n\nA simple geo URI might look like:\n\nwhere the two numerical values represent latitude and longitude respectively, and are separated by a comma.

{"id": "27782581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27782581", "title": "Horizontal position representation", "text": "Horizontal position representation\n\nA position representation is the parameters used to express a position relative to a reference. Representing position in three dimensions is often done by a Euclidean vector. However, when representing position relative to the Earth it is often more convenient to represent vertical position as altitude or depth, and to use some other parameters to represent horizontal position. There are also several applications where only the horizontal position is of interest, this might e.g. be the case for ships and ground vehicles/cars.\n\nThere are several options for horizontal position representations, each with different properties which makes them appropriate for different applications. Latitude/longitude and UTM are common horizontal position representations.\n\nThe horizontal position has two degrees of freedom, and thus two parameters are sufficient to uniquely describe such a position. However, similarly to the use of Euler angles as a formalism for representing rotations, using only the minimum number of parameters gives singularities, and thus three parameters are required for the horizontal position to avoid this.\n\nThe most common horizontal position representation is latitude and longitude. The parameters are intuitive and well known, and are thus suited for communicating a position to humans, e.g. using a position plot.\n\nHowever, latitude and longitude should be used with care in mathematical expressions (including calculations in computer programs). The main reason is the singularities at the Poles, which makes longitude undefined at these points. Also near the poles the latitude/longitude grid is highly non-linear, and several errors may occur in calculations that are sufficiently accurate on other locations.\nAnother problematic area is the meridian at ±180° longitude, where the longitude has a discontinuity, and hence specific program code must often be written to handle this. An example of the consequences of omitting such code is the crash of the navigation systems of twelve F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft while crossing this meridian.\n\n\"n\"-vector is a three parameter non-singular horizontal position representation that can replace latitude and longitude. Geometrically, it is a unit vector which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The vector is decomposed in an Earth centered earth fixed coordinate system. It behaves the same at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical one-to-one property. The vector formulation makes it possible to use standard 3D vector algebra, and thus \"n\"-vector is well-suited for mathematical calculations, e.g. adding, subtracting, interpolating and averaging positions.\n\nUsing three parameters, \"n\"-vector is inconvenient for communicating a position directly to humans and before showing a position plot, a conversion to latitude/longitude might be needed.\n\nWhen carrying out several calculations within a limited area, a Cartesian coordinate system might be defined with the origin at a specified Earth-fixed position. The origin is often selected at the surface of the reference ellipsoid, with the \"z\"-axis in the vertical direction. Hence (three dimensional) position vectors relative to this coordinate frame will have two horizontal and one vertical parameter. The axes are typically selected as North-East-Down or East-North-Up, and thus this system can be viewed as a linearization of the meridians and parallels.\n\nFor small areas a local coordinate system can be convenient for relative positioning, but with increasing (horizontal) distances, errors will increase and repositioning of the tangent point may be required. The alignment along the north and east directions is not possible at the Poles, and near the Poles these directions might have significant errors (here the linearization is valid only in a very small area).\n\nInstead of one local Cartesian grid, that needs to be repositioned as the position of interest moves, a fixed set of map projections covering the Earth can be defined. UTM is one such system, dividing the Earth into 60 longitude zones (and with UPS covering the Polar regions).\n\nUTM is widely used, and the coordinates approximately corresponds to meters north and east. However, as a set of map-projections it has inherent distortions, and thus most calculations based on UTM will not be exact. The crossing of zones gives additional complexity.\n\nWhen deciding which parameters to use for representing position in a specific application, there are several properties that should be considered. The following table gives a summary of what to consider.\n\n"}
{"id": "52084820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52084820", "title": "Ice navigation", "text": "Ice navigation\n\nIce navigation is a specialist area of navigation involving the use of maritime skills to determine and monitor the position of ships in cold waters, where ice is a hazard to the safety of navigation. The presence of sea ice requires a ship to exercise caution, for example by avoiding icebergs, slowly sailing through a lead, or by working with an icebreaker to follow a course through the ice to a destination. Additionally ships must also deal with the extreme cold of the climate in regions such as the poles; this involves removal of ice accumulation from the ship, as well as protecting the crew from the elements while working on the deck. Ships and their crews operating in ice will follow established rules of seamanship, as well as complying with national and international regulations such as the Polar Code.\n\nIce navigation occurs wherever a waterborne vessel transits through sea ice. One of the more common regions for ice navigation is the Baltic Sea, where vessels visiting the Baltic States will make their way through first year ice in the winter months, often with an Icebreaker, or with ice reports, charts and data provided by meteorological offices. Other areas include the Arctic Ocean, where increasing numbers of ships are transiting the region in the summer months for cruising and to transport cargo, as a result of oil and gas extraction in areas such as Yamal. The problems of increased shipping in polar regions presents additional challenges, including maritime safety concerns in the event that ice navigation is not carried out carefully. Ships will also pass through ice when navigating in the Antarctic, although most ships are either research vessels or cruise ships that have been especially ice strengthened. Other significant maritime regions where ships will navigate through Ice include the Saint Lawrence Seaway, around Greenland and the Canadian coast, the North Atlantic during iceberg season and through the Northwest Passage.\n\nThe accumulation of ice on the superstructure is a dangerous phenomenon. When the temperature is below slight icing will occur at winds of 5 Bft, moderate icing at 7 Bft, and severe icing at 8 Bft. When sailing in fresh water, icing will occur from and below. The more common causes of ice formation on the superstructure are from spray by wave crests and ship-generated spray. Other possibilities are snow fall, sea fog, a drastic fall in ambient temperature and also freezing raindrops in contact with the cold steel. The heading of the vessel relative to the wind and seas will determine which parts of the superstructure will ice first. Icing can immobilise equipment such as anchors or cause a dangerous list if the windward side of the vessel ices more heavily.\n\nA radar can be useful in detecting ice, but the returning signal which bounces off ice (even icebergs) is very faint, much lower than from ships. Conventional marine radars are designed for target detection and avoidance. Enhanced marine radars provide a higher definition image of the ice that the vessel is transmitting and will result in a much clearer image. This image can be used to identify the quantity and sort of ice that has to be dealt with. In standard radar, sea clutter affects the ability to see in the near vicinity of the vessel. An X-band radar set to a short pulse can give improved results.\n\n"}

As Kleinjena marks the starting point for the vast growth of the region in the 12th century, it is indispensable for an understanding of the history of this cultural landscape as a whole.\n\nThe castle of Kleinjena was built by the influential Ekkehardine dynasty. This dynasty owned estates in the old settlement area in the northern part of Thuringia and in the area of the conﬂuence of the rivers Saale and Unstrut. The family seat was the castle of Gene, which was situated south of the Unstrut River in the former diocese of the Archbishopric of Mainz. Like other Ottonian palaces or imperial castles of the time, the castle complex of Ekkehard I was a segmented complex with two ramparts on a ﬂat spur. Its main rampart and the related trench have ﬂattened to a great extent, but they are still clearly visible in the terrain. Following the murder of Ekkehard I, the site was gradually abandoned as the margravial brothers Hermann and Ekkehard II transferred their family seatfrom Kleinjena to Naumburg (Nuenburch), first mentioned in the records in 1012. \nEncouraged by a privilege granted by Emperor Conrad II in 1033, also the merchants of Kleinjena moved to Naumburg, since they were guaranteed free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile. The comparative advantage of Naumburg was also a topographical one as that the descent of the long-distance routes coming from the plateau was not as steep as in Kleinjena and Grossjena.\n\nThese archeologically documented remains of the castle of the Markgraves of Meißen, the Ekkehardines, date back to the 10th century. At the European level, these preserved structures are an early evidence of the efforts undertaken by the high nobility to impose its centre of power through large-scale fortifications that eventually served as their memorials.\n\n\n"}

Starting from approx. 1560, this understanding of landmark was replaced by a more general one. A landmark became a \"conspicuous object in a landscape\".\nA \"landmark\" literally meant a geographic feature used by explorers and others to find their way back or through an area. For example, the Table Mountain near Cape Town, South Africa is used as the landmark to help sailors to navigate around southern tip of Africa during the Age of Exploration. Artificial structures are also sometimes built to assist sailors in naval navigation. The Lighthouse of Alexandria and Colossus of Rhodes are ancient structures built to lead ships to the port.\n\nIn modern usage, a landmark includes anything that is easily recognizable, such as a monument, building, or other structure. In American English it is the main term used to designate places that might be of interest to tourists due to notable physical features or historical significance. Landmarks in the British English sense are often used for casual navigation, such as giving directions. This is done in American English as well.\n\nIn urban studies as well as in geography, a landmark is furthermore defined as an external point of reference that helps orienting in a familiar or unfamiliar environment. Landmarks are often used in verbal route instructions and as such an object of study by linguists as well as in other fields of study.\n\nLandmarks are usually classified as either natural landmarks or man-made landmarks, both are originally used to support navigation on finding directions. A variant is a \"seamark\" or \"daymark\", a structure usually built intentionally to aid sailors navigating featureless coasts.\n\nNatural landmarks can be characteristic features, such as mountains or plateaus. Examples of natural landmarks are Table Mountain in South Africa, Mount Ararat in Turkey, Uluru in Australia, Mount Fuji in Japan and Grand Canyon in the United States. Trees might also serve as local landmarks, such as jubilee oaks or conifers. Some landmark trees may be nicknamed, examples being \"Queen's Oak\", \"Hanging Oak\" or \"Centennial Tree\".\n\nIn modern sense, landmarks are usually referred to as monuments or prominent distinctive buildings, used as the symbol of a certain area, city, or nation, such as the Statue of Unity in Narmada ,White House in Washington (D.C.), Statue of Liberty in New York City, Eiffel Tower in Paris , Colosseum in Rome, Big Ben in London, Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Bratislava Castle in Bratislava, Space Needle in Seattle, Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Sydney Opera House both in Sydney, Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the CN Tower In Toronto, or Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. Church spires and mosque's minarets are often very tall and visible from many miles around, thus often serve as built landmarks. Also town hall towers and belfries often have a landmark character.\n\n"}

It is not the same in different parts of the world. Landscaping varies according to different regions. Therefore, normally local natural experts are recommended if it is done for the first time. Understanding of the site is one of the chief essentials for successful landscaping. Different natural features like terrain, topography, soil qualities, prevailing winds, depth of the frost line, and the system of native flora and fauna must be taken into account. Sometimes the land is not fit for landscaping. In order to landscape it, the land must be reshaped. This reshaping of land is called grading.\n\nRemoval of earth from the land is called cutting while when earth is added to the slope, it is called filling. Sometimes the grading process may involve removal of excessive waste (landfills), soil and rocks, so designers should take into account while in the planning stage.\n\nIn the start, the landscaping contractor makes a letter which is a rough design and layout of what could be done with the land in order to achieve the desired outcome. Different pencils are required to make graphics of the picture. Landscaping has become more technological than natural, as few projects begin without bulldozers, lawnmowers, or chainsaws. Different areas have different qualities of plants. When growing new grass, it should ideally be done in the spring and the fall seasons to maximize growth and to minimize the spread of weeds. It is generally agreed that Fertilizers are required for good plant growth. Some landscapers prefer to use mix gravel with rocks of varying sizes to add interest in large areas.\n\n"}

It is used extensively in the disciplines of surveying, geodesy, and photogrammetry—the field of geomatics, collectively.\n\nThere are three forms of least squares adjustment: \"parametric\", \"conditional\", and \"combined\". In parametric adjustment, one can find an observation equation \"h(X)=Y\" relating observations \"Y\" explicitly in terms of parameters \"X\" (leading to the A-model below). In conditional adjustment, there exists a condition equation \"g(Y)=0\" involving only observations \"Y\" (leading to the B-model below) — with no parameters \"X\" at all. Finally, in a combined adjustment, both parameters \"X\" and observations \"Y\" are involved implicitly in a mixed-model equation \"f(X,Y)=0\". Clearly, parametric and conditional adjustments correspond to the more general combined case when \"f(X,Y)=h(X)-Y\" and \"f(X,Y)=g(Y)\", respectively. Yet the special cases warrant simpler solutions, as detailed below. Often in the literature, \"Y\" may be denoted \"L\".\n\nThe equalities above only hold for the estimated parameters formula_1 and observations formula_2, thus formula_3. In contrast, measured observations formula_4 and approximate parameters formula_5 produce a nonzero \"misclosure\":\nOne can proceed to Taylor series expansion of the equations, which results in the Jacobians or design matrices: the first one,\nand the second one,\nThe linearized model then reads:\nwhere formula_10 are estimated \"parameter corrections\" to the \"a priori\" values, and formula_11 are post-fit \"observation residuals\".\n\nIn the parametric adjustment, the second design matrix is an identity, \"B=-I\", and the misclosure vector can be interpreted as the pre-fit residuals, formula_12, so the system simplifies to:\nwhich is in the form of ordinary least squares. \nIn the conditional adjustment, the first design matrix is null, \"A=0\".\nFor the more general cases, Lagrange multipliers are introduced to relate the two Jacobian matrices and transform the constrained least squares problem into an unconstrained one (albeit a larger one). In any case, their manipulation leads to the formula_1 and formula_2 vectors as well as the respective parameters and observations \"a posteriori\" covariance matrices.\n\nGiven the matrices and vectors above, their solution is found via standard least-squares methods; e.g., forming the normal matrix and applying Cholesky decomposition, applying the QR factorization directly to the Jacobian matrix, iterative methods for very large systems, etc.\n\n\n\n\nIf rank deficiency is encountered, it can often be rectified by the inclusion of additional equations imposing constraints on the parameters and/or observations, leading to constrained least squares.\n\nLecture notes and Technical reports:\n\nBooks:\n"}

The term \"location\" generally implies a higher degree of certainty than \"place\", the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry.\n\nA relative location, or situation, is described as a displacement from another site. An example is \"3 miles northwest of Seattle\".\n\nA location, settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary which is not well defined in varies by context. London, for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage. An area within a town, such as Covent Garden in London, also almost always has some ambiguity as to its extent.\n\nAn absolute location is designated using a specific pairing of latitude and longitude in a Cartesian coordinate grid — for example, a Spherical coordinate system or an ellipsoid-based system such as the World Geodetic System — or similar methods. For instance, the position of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela can be expressed approximately in the WGS84 coordinate system as the location 9.80°N (latitude), 71.56°W (longitude). It is, however, just one way. Alternative ways can be seen in this Geo Hack link: .\n\n\"Absolute location\", however, is a term with little real meaning, since any location must be expressed relative to something else. For example, longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian, a line arbitrarily chosen to pass through Greenwich, London. Similarly, latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the Equator. Because latitude and longitude are expressed \"relative\" to these lines, a position expressed in latitude and longitude is actually a relative location.\n\n"}
{"id": "5081318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5081318", "title": "Macedonia (terminology)", "text": "Macedonia (terminology)\n\nThe name Macedonia is used in a number of competing or overlapping meanings to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples in a part of south-eastern Europe. It has been a major source of political controversy since the early 20th century. The situation is complicated because different ethnic groups use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, with different political connotations.\n\nHistorically, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula. Geographically, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. Demographically, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as \"Macedonians\": two, a Bulgarian and a Greek one at a regional level, while a third ethnic Macedonian one at a national level. Linguistically, the names and affiliations of languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. Politically, the rights to the extent of the use of the name \"Macedonia\" and its derivatives has led to a diplomatic dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. Despite mediation of the United Nations, the dispute is still pending resolution since 1993, but as a result it was admitted under the provisional reference of the \"former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", sometimes abbreviated as FYROM.\n\nThe name \"Macedonia\" derives from the Greek (\"Makedonía\"), a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians, from the Greek (\"Makedones\"), \"Macedonians\", explained as having originally meant either \"the tall ones\" or \"highlanders\". The word (\"Makednon\") is first attested in Herodotus as the name which the Greek ethnos was called (which was later called Dorian) when it settled around Pindus mountain range. \"Makednon\" is related to the Ancient Greek adjective (\"makednós\"), meaning \"tall, slim\", attested in Homer and Hesychius of Alexandria in its feminine form \"μακεδνή\" (\"makednē\"), meaning \"long, tall\". It cognates with the words (\"makros\", \"long, large\") and (\"mēkos\", \"length\"), both deriving from the Indo-European root \"*mak-\", meaning \"long' or \"slender\". Linguist Robert S. P. Beekes claims that both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology.\n\nThe region of Macedonia has been home to several historical political entities, which have used the name \"Macedonia\"; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different.\n\nMacedonia or \"Macedon\", the ancient kingdom, was located on the periphery of Archaic and Classical Greece, and later became the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece. It was centered on the fertile plains west of the Gulf of Salonica (today north-western Greece); the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BC. Its extent beyond the center varied; some Macedonian kings could not hold their capital; Philip II expanded his power until it reached from Epirus, across Thrace to Gallipoli, and from Thermopylae to the Danube. His son Alexander the Great conquered most of the land in southwestern Asia stretching from what is currently Turkey in the west to parts of India in the east. However, while Alexander's conquests are of major historical importance as having launched the Hellenistic Age, Macedon as a state had no significant territorial gains due to them. Alexander's kingdom fell apart after his death in 323 BC; several of his Successors attempted to form a kingdom for themselves in Macedonia; the kingdom formed by Antigonus Gonatas contained all the land Philip II had started with and controlled much of what is now modern Greece; it lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168 BC.\n\nThe ancient Romans had two different entities called \"Macedonia\", at different levels. Macedonia was established as a Roman province in 146 BC. Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but during the Roman Republic and the Principate it extended west to the Adriatic and south to Central Greece.\n\nUnder Diocletian, Thessaly, including parts of West Macedonia, was split off to form a new province, and the central and southern Balkan provinces were grouped into the Diocese of Moesia. At some point in the 4th century (first securely attested in 370) this was divided into two new dioceses, the mostly Latin-speaking Diocese of Dacia in the north and the mostly Greek-speaking Diocese of Macedonia in the south. Under Constantine the Great, the western part of the province of Macedonia was also split off to form the new province of Epirus nova. After Constantine's death, the western Balkans, Macedonia included, became part of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.\n\nWith the exception of a short-lived division between \"Macedonia Prima\" in the south and \"Macedonia Salutaris\" in the north towards the end of the 4th century (attested only in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\"), Macedonia formed a single province until re-divided into southern and northern parts sometime in the late 5th century (the division is first securely attested in 482), although the province seems to have been reunified by 535. According to the 6th-century \"Synecdemus\", \"Macedonia Prima\", with Thessalonica as its capital and governed by a \"consularis\", counted 32 cities, and \"Macedonia Secunda\" in the north, with Stobi as its capital and governed by a \"praeses\", only eight. The approximate boundary between the two ran on a rough line from north of Bitola (which belonged to \"Macedonia Prima\") to the area of Demir Kapija.\n\nDuring the 7th century, most of the Balkans were overrun by Slavic invasions, which left only the fortified towns and the coasts in the hands of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. \"Macedonia\" was then used for a new theme in the late 8th century under Irene of Athens. Geographically however it was located in Thrace and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of Thessalonica, Strymon and other smaller commands such as Boleron or Drougoubiteia. Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was \"army\". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever they happened to be. Thus the Armeniac theme was considerably west of Armenia; the Thracesian Theme was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace. The Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, Basil I the Macedonian, an Armenian by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.\n\nThe interior of Macedonia remained in Slavic and later Bulgarian hands until the campaigns of Basil II, which ended the existence of the Bulgarian state and extended Byzantine authority across the central and northern Balkans. Thereafter Macedonia remained under Byzantine control until the Fourth Crusade (1204). A short-lived Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica was established which survived until 1224, when it was captured by Epirus. Most of Macedonia then came under the control of the Empire of Nicaea in 1246, although its northern regions remained disputed with the Serbs and the Bulgarians. Most of the region was conquered by the Serbs under Stephen Dushan during the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347. Only Thessalonica and its environs remained in Byzantine hands. By the late 14th century, the Ottoman Turks in turn had conquered the region, although Thessalonica held out under Byzantine and later Venetian control until 1430.\n\nThe Ottomans did not keep Macedonia as an administrative unit: since 1864 parts of geographical Macedonia lay in three vilayets, which also comprised some non-Macedonian areas. The northern part was the Kosovo vilayet and then of Skopje; the Thessaloniki (south), and the Monastir Vilayet (western) were also created. This administrative division lasted until 1912–13, when Macedonia was divided among the Balkan states.\n\nSince the early stages of the Greek Revolution, the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between Arta and Volos. When the Ottoman Empire started breaking apart, \"Macedonia\" was claimed by all members of the Balkan League (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria), and by Romania. Under the Treaty of San Stefano that ended the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78 the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of Bulgaria, but after the Congress of Berlin in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied \"Macedonia\" in the First Balkan War in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the Second Balkan War erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into the following entities, that existed or still exist in this region:\n\nMacedonia (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in south-eastern Europe, covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.\n\nIn a historic context, the term \"Macedonia\" was used in various ways. Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire; its entire territory was part of the \"beylerbeylik\" of Rumelia. The geographer H. R. Wilkinson suggests that the region \"defies definition\" but that many mappers agree \"on its general location\". Macedonia was well enough defined in 1897 for Gladstone to propose \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\"; philhellenes argued that the phrase could not be used by a man of impartiallity, while Turcophiles asserted that there are six different kinds of Macedonians, and only Turkish rule could prevail total anarchy in the region. The Balkan nations began to proclaim their rights to it after the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 and its revision at the Congress of Berlin.\n\nMany ethnographic maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was denomination, descent, language, self-identification or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of religion, was misquoted by all sides; descent, or \"race\", was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian \"with Bulgarian influences\", Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.\n\nThese maps also differed somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the Aegean Sea and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman Rumelia) was debatable.\n\nThe Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian Kǎnčev placed the northern boundary of Macedonia at the Šar Mountains and the Crna hills, as had scholars before 1878. The Serb Gopčevič preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from Skopje to Strumica to \"Old Serbia\"; and some later Greek geographers have defined a more restricted Macedonia. In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included Prizren, where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, Grevena, Korçë, and Konitsa varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower Mesta / Nestos river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude Bansko and Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev.\n\nThe region of Macedonia is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub-regions. The name \"Macedonia\" appears under certain contexts on the major regions, while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local toponyms:\n\nThe region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in ethnic Macedonian literature of an irredentist nature.\n\n\"Aegean Macedonia\" (or Greek Macedonia) refers to an area in the south of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are, overall, those of ancient Macedonia in Greece. It covers an area of (for discussion of the reported irredentist origin of this term, see Aegean Macedonia).\n\n\"Pirin Macedonia\" (or Bulgarian Macedonia) is an area in the east of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area approximately coincide with those of Blagoevgrad Province in Bulgaria. It covers an area of .\n\n\"Vardar Macedonia\" (formerly Yugoslav Macedonia) is an area in the north of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are those of the Republic of Macedonia. It covers an area of .\n\nIn addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in Albania and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows, but typically are not so referred to by non-partisan scholars.\n\nMala Prespa and Golo Brdo is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in Albania, mainly around Lake Ohrid. It includes parts of the Korçë, Pogradec and Devoll districts. These districts in whole occupy about , but the area concerned is significantly smaller. Gora (part of the municipality of Dragaš) and Prohor Pčinjski are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia.\n\nThe region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as \"Macedonian\" on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both \"Macedonian\" on a regional, and \"Greek\" on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, the use of the term on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.\n\nThe self-identifying Macedonians (collectively referring to the inhabitants of the region) that inhabit or inhabited the area are:\n\nAs an ethnic group, Macedonians refers to the majority (64.7%, 2002) of the population of the Republic of Macedonia. Statistics for 2002 indicate the population of ethnic Macedonians within the country as c. 1,300,000. On the other hand, as a legal term, it refers to all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, irrespective of their ethnic or religious affiliation. However, the preamble of the constitution distinguishes between \"the Macedonian people\" and the \"Albanians, Turks, Vlachs, Romanics and other nationalities living in the Republic of Macedonia\", but for whom \"full equality as citizens\" is provided. As of 2002 the total population of the country is 2,022,547.\n\nAs a regional group in Greece, Macedonians refers to ethnic Greeks (98%, 2001) living in regions referred to as Macedonia, and particularly Greek Macedonia. This group composes the vast majority of the population of the Greek region of Macedonia. The 2001 census for the total population of the Macedonia region in Greece shows 2,625,681.\n\nThe same term in antiquity described the inhabitants of the kingdom of Macedon, including their notable rulers Philip II and Alexander the Great who self-identified as Greeks.\n\nAs a regional group in Bulgaria, Macedonians refers to the inhabitants of Bulgarian Macedonia, who in their vast majority self-identify as Bulgarians at a national level and as \"Macedonians\" at a regional, but not ethnic level. As of 2001, the total population of Bulgarian Macedonia is 341,245, while the ethnic Macedonians living in the same region are 3,117. The \"Bulgarian Macedonians\" also self-identify as \"Piriners\" (пиринци, \"pirintsi\") to avoid confusion with the neighboring ethnic group.\n\nMacedo-Romanians can be used as an alternative name for Aromanians, people living throughout the southern Balkans, especially in northern Greece, Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and as an emigrant community in Northern Dobruja, Romania. According to Ethnologue, their total population in all countries is 306,237. This not very frequent appellation is the only one with the disambiguating portmanteau, both within the members of the same ethnic group and the other ethnic groups in the area. To make matters more confusing, Aromanians are often called \"Machedoni\" by Romanians, as opposed to the citizens of Macedonia, who are called \"Macedoneni\".\n\nThe ethnic Albanians living in the region of Macedonia, as defined above, are mainly concentrated in the Republic of Macedonia (especially in the northwestern part that borders Kosovo and Albania), and less in the Albanian minor sub-region of Macedonia around the Lake Ohrid. As of 2002, the total population of Albanians within the republic is 509,083 or 25.2% of the country's total population.\n\nAs language is one of the elements tied in with national identity, the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a language or a dialect:\n\nThe origins of the Ancient Macedonian language are currently debated. At this time it is not conclusively determined whether the language/dialect was a Greek dialect related to Doric Greek\nor Aeolic Greek dialects among others, a sibling language of ancient Greek forming a \"Hellenic\" (i.e. Greco-Macedonian) supergroup, or viewed as an Indo-European language which is a close cousin to Greek (and perhaps somewhat related to Thracian or Phrygian languages). The scientific community generally agrees that, although sources are available (e.g. Hesychius' lexicon, Pella curse tablet) there is no decisive evidence to exclude any of the above hypotheses.\n\nModern Macedonian language, a south Slavic language, is unrelated to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language can be found in the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.\n\nMacedonian is also the name of a dialect of Modern Greek, a language of the Indo-European family. Additionally, Macedo-Romanian is an Eastern Romance language, spoken in Southeastern Europe by the Aromanians.\n\nThe controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by the official name of \"Socialist Republic of Macedonia\", the others being Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in the change of its name to \"Republic of Macedonia\".\n\nRepublic of Macedonia is the constitutional name of the sovereign state which occupies the northern part of the geographical region of \"Macedonia\", which roughly coincides with the geographic subregion of Vardar Macedonia. \"The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" (FYROM) is a term used for this state by the main international organisations, including United Nations,\nEuropean Union,\nNATO,\nIMF,\nWTO,\nIOC,\nWorld Bank,\nEBRD,\nOSCE,\nFIFA,\nand FIBA.\nThe term was introduced in 1993 by the United Nations, following a naming dispute with Greece. Some countries use this term as a stop-gap measure, pending resolution of the naming dispute.\n\nGreece and the Republic of Macedonia each consider this name a compromise: it is opposed by some Greeks for containing the Greek self-identifying name \"Macedonia\", and by many in the Republic of Macedonia for not being the short self-identifying name. Greece uses it in both the abbreviated (\"FYROM\" or \"ΠΓΔΜ\") and spellout form (\"Πρώην Γιουγκοσλαβική Δημοκρατία της Μακεδονίας\").\n\nMacedonia refers also to a geographic region in Greece, which roughly coincides with the southernmost major geographic subregion of Macedonia. It is divided in the three administrative sub-regions (\"regions\") of West, Central, and East Macedonia and Thrace. The region is overseen by the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace. The capital of Greek Macedonia is Thessaloniki, which is the largest city in the region of Macedonia; Greeks often call it the \"co-capital\" of Greece.\n\nEthnic Macedonian irredentists following the idea of a \"United Macedonia\" have expressed claims to what they refer to as \"Aegean Macedonia\" (in Greece), \"Pirin Macedonia\" (in Bulgaria), \"Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo\" (in Albania), and \"Gora and Prohor Pčinjski\" (in Serbia).\n\nLoring Danforth, a professor of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.\n\nAlthough ethnic Macedonians agree Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation, there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be. These were summarized by Danforth:\n\nSchoolbooks and official government publications in the Republic have shown the country as part of an \"unliberated\" whole, although the constitution of the Republic, especially after its amendment in 1995, does not include any territorial claims.\n\nDanforth describes the Greek position on Macedonia as follows: because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks, and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity, it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians. According to Danforth, this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as \"Skopians\", a practice comparable to calling Greeks \"Athenians\". Danforth asserts that the negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points: the existence of a Macedonian nation, a Macedonian language, and a Macedonian minority in Greece. More specifically, Danforth says:\n\nThus from the Greek nationalist perspective the use of the term \"Macedonian\" by the \"Slavs of Skopje\" constitutes a \"felony\", an \"act of plagiarism\" against the Greek people. Greek nationalists believe that, by calling themselves \"Macedonians\", the ethnic Macedonians are \"stealing\" a Greek name, \"embezzling\" Greek cultural heritage, and \"falsifying\" Greek history. Greek fears that the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the ethnic Macedonians will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events.\n\nFrom a different point of view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece \"in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity\". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis, \"a nondescript parasitic state\" that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an \"unhomogeneous little new nation\". Floudas criticizes Greek stance as follows:\n\nAs of early 2008, the official position of Greece, adopted unanimously by the four largest political parties, has made a more moderate shift towards accepting a \"composite name solution\" (i.e. the use of the name \"Macedonia\" plus some qualifier), so as to disambiguate the former Yugoslav Republic from the Greek region of Macedonia and the wider geographic region of the same name.\n\n\nAll these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from \"Macedonia\" to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.\n\nBulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek.\n\nCertain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:\n\n\n\nThe last eight terms are often considered offensive in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n\nThe first three terms are often considered offensive in Greece.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9881335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9881335", "title": "Passage planning", "text": "Passage planning\n\nPassage planning or voyage planning is a procedure to develop a complete description of a vessel's voyage from start to finish. The plan includes leaving the dock and harbor area, the \"en route\" portion of a voyage, approaching the destination, and mooring, the industry term for this is 'berth to berth'. According to international law, a vessel's captain is legally responsible for passage planning, The duty of passage planning is usually delegated to the ship's navigation officer, typically the second officer on merchant ships.\n\nStudies show that human error is a factor in 80 percent of navigational accidents and that in many cases the human making the error had access to information that could have prevented the accident. The practice of voyage planning has evolved from penciling lines on nautical charts to a process of risk management.\n\nPassage planning consists of four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring. These stages are specified in \"International Maritime Organization Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For Voyage Planning,\" which are, in turn, reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries. The \"Guidelines\" specify fifty elements of passage planning, some of which are only applicable in certain situations.\n\nThe \"Guidelines\" specify three key items to consider in the practice of voyage planning:\n\n\nVoyage planning starts with the appraisal stage. Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed mental model of how the entire voyage will proceed. The appraisal stage consists of gathering and contemplating all information relevant to the voyage. Much of this appraisal is done by consulting nautical charts, nautical publications and performing a number of technical tasks such as weather forecasting, prediction of tides and currents, and checks of local regulations and warnings.\n\nNautical publications are a valuable guide to local conditions and regulations, but they must be updated and actually read to be of any use. These publications could include Sailing Directions and Coast Pilots or similar texts produced by other authorities.\n\nThe next stage of the process is known as the planning stage. Once information is gathered and considered, the navigator can begin the process of actually laying out the voyage. The process involves projecting various future events including landfalls, narrow passages, and course changes expected during the voyage. This mental model becomes the standard by which the navigator measures progress toward the goal of a safe and efficient voyage, and it is manifested in a passage plan.\n\nA good passage plan will include a track line laid out upon the best-scale charts available. This track is judged with respect to at least nine separate criteria given in the \"Guidelines\" including under-keel clearance, safe speed, air draft, the use of routing and reporting services (TSS and VTS), and the availability of contingencies in case of emergency.\n\nThe navigator will draw and redraw the track line until it is safe, efficient, and in line with all applicable laws and regulations. When the track is finished, it is becoming common practice to also enter it into electronic navigation tools such as an Electronic Chart Display and Information System, a chartplotter, an ARPA system, or a GPS unit.\n\nWhen working in a team environment, the passage plan should be communicated to the navigation team in a pre-voyage conference in order to ensure that all members of the team share the same mental model of the entire trip.\n\nThe third stage of passage planning is the execution stage. The IMO was careful to include execution as part of the process of passage planning. This underscores the fact that the \"Guidelines\" list a number of tasks that are to executed during the course of the voyage. It also reiterates the captain's responsibility to treat the plan as a \"living document\" and to review or change it in case of any special circumstances that should arise.\n\nThe fourth and final stage of voyage planning is the monitoring stage. Once the voyage has begun the progress of the vessel along its planned route must be monitored. This requires that the ship's position be determined, using standard methods including dead reckoning, celestial navigation, pilotage, and electronic navigation.\n\nAccording to the \"Guidelines,\" the passage plan should always be available to the officer on watch on the bridge. The \"Guidelines\" also specify that deviations from the plan should be clearly recorded and be consistent with other provisions of the \"Guidelines.\"\n\nIn modern times, computer software can greatly simplify the passage planning process and ensure that nothing important is overlooked. Passage planning software may include functions such as waypoint management, distance calculators, tide and tidal current\npredictors, celestial navigational calculators, consumables estimators for fuel, oil, water, and stores, and other useful applications.\n\n"}
{"id": "43717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43717", "title": "Prisoner's dilemma", "text": "Prisoner's dilemma\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it \"prisoner's dilemma\", presenting it as follows:\n\nIt is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other. The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a systemic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of \"rational\" self-interested action.\n\nAn extended \"iterated\" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by backward induction) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many real world situations involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label \"prisoner's dilemma\" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.\n\nTwo prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.\nThe normal game is shown below:\n\nIt is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other (\"defecting\"). The reasoning involves an argument by dilemma: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.\n\nBecause defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a dominant strategy. Mutual defection is the only strong Nash equilibrium in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.\n\nThe structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either \"Cooperate\" or \"Defect\".\n\nIf both players cooperate, they both receive the reward \"R\" for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff \"P\". If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff \"T\", while Red receives the \"sucker's\" payoff, \"S\". Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff \"S\", while Red receives the temptation payoff \"T\".\n\nThis can be expressed in normal form:\n\nand to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:\n\nThe payoff relationship \"R\" > \"P\" implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships \"T\" > \"R\" and \"P\" > \"S\" imply that defection is the dominant strategy for both agents.\n\nThe \"donation game\" is a form of prisoner's dilemma in which cooperation corresponds to offering the other player a benefit \"b\" at a personal cost \"c\" with \"b\" > \"c\". Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus\n\nNote that (i.e. ) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).\n\nThe donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The marginal utility of an apple to the orange-grower X is \"b\", which is higher than the marginal utility (\"c\") of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is \"b\" while the marginal utility of an apple is \"c\". If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of \"b\"-\"c\". If one \"defects\" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of \"b\", while the cooperator will lose \"c\". If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.\n\nIf two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.\n\nIn addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2\"R\" > \"T\" + \"S,\" to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.\n\nThe iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the \"Peace-War game\".\n\nIf the game is played exactly \"N\" times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible Nash equilibrium is to always defect. The proof is inductive: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on. The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.\n\nUnlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer. The superrational strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed \"N\" is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large \"N\", experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.\n\nFor cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds \"N\" must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by Robert Aumann in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.\n\nInterest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by Robert Axelrod in his book \"The Evolution of Cooperation\" (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the \"N\" step prisoner's dilemma (with \"N\" fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.\n\nAxelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more altruistic strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by natural selection.\n\nThe winning deterministic strategy was tit for tat, which Anatol Rapoport developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of BASIC, and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be \"tit for tat with forgiveness\". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.\n\nBy analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.\n\n\nThe optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.\n\nIn the strategy called Pavlov, win-stay, lose-switch, faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn. In certain circumstances, Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.\n\nDeriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:\n\nAlthough tit for tat is considered to be the most robust basic strategy, a team from Southampton University in England (led by Professor Nicholas Jennings and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start. Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result, this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.\n\nThis strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of minmaxing). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, Richard Dawkins in his book \"The Selfish Gene\" pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening \"ten move dance\" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.\n\nIn a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of \"cooperation probabilities\". In an encounter between player \"X\" and player \"Y\", \"X\" 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities \"P\" of cooperating with \"Y\". \"P\" is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If \"P\" is a function of only their most recent \"n\" encounters, it is called a \"memory-n\" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities: formula_1, where formula_2 is the probability that \"X\" will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which \"X\" cooperated and \"Y\" defected, then formula_3 is the probability that \"X\" will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the \"tit for tat\" strategy written as \"P\"={1,0,1,0}, in which \"X\" responds as \"Y\" did in the previous encounter. Another is the win–stay, lose–switch strategy written as \"P\"={1,0,0,1}, in which \"X\" responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a \"win\" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.\n\nIf we define \"P\" as the above 4-element strategy vector of \"X\" and formula_4 as the 4-element strategy vector of \"Y\", a transition matrix \"M\" may be defined for \"X\" whose \"ij\" th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between \"X\" and \"Y\" will be \"j\" given that the previous encounter was \"i\", where \"i\" and \"j\" are one of the four outcome indices: \"cc\", \"cd\", \"dc\", or \"dd\". For example, from \"X\" 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is \"cd\" given that the previous encounter was \"cd\" is equal to formula_5. (Note that the indices for \"Q\" are from \"Y\" 's point of view: a \"cd\" outcome for \"X\" is a \"dc\" outcome for \"Y\".) Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a stochastic process and \"M\" is a stochastic matrix, allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.\n\nOne result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector \"v\" for the matrix \"M\" such that formula_6. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that \"v\" is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The \"ij\" th entry in formula_7 will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between \"X\" and \"Y\" will be \"j\" given that the encounter \"n\" steps previous is \"i\". In the limit as \"n\" approaches infinity, \"M\" will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing \"j\" which will be independent of \"i\". In other words, the rows of formula_8 will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that \"v\" is a stationary vector for formula_7 and particularly formula_8, so that each row of formula_8 will be equal to \"v\". Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for \"X\". Defining formula_12 and formula_13 as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From \"X\" 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for \"X\" and \"Y\" can now be specified as formula_14 and formula_15, allowing the two strategies \"P\" and \"Q\" to be compared for their long term payoffs.\n\nIn 2012, William H. Press and Freeman Dyson published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called \"zero-determinant\" (ZD) strategies. The long term payoffs for encounters between \"X\" and \"Y\" can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: formula_16 and formula_17, which do not involve the stationary vector \"v\". Since the determinant function formula_18 is linear in \"f\", it follows that formula_19 (where \"U\"={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which formula_20 is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation formula_21.\n\nTit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is \"fair\" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of ultimatum game. Specifically, \"X\" is able to choose a strategy for which formula_22, unilaterally setting formula_23 to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of \"Y\" 's strategy, offering an opportunity for \"X\" to \"extort\" player \"Y\" (and vice versa). (It turns out that if \"X\" tries to set formula_24 to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.)\n\nAn extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not evolutionarily stable. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).\n\nTheory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and win–stay, lose–switch agents.\n\nWhile extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called \"generous\" strategies \"is\" both stable and robust. In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013. Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called \"good\" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013) to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.\n\nMost work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from assorting with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.\n\nPlayers cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection. In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies. Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy – that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.\n\nThe only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.\n\nThe prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the social sciences such as economics, politics, and sociology, as well as to the biological sciences such as ethology and evolutionary biology. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.\n\nIn environmental studies, the PD is evident in crises such as global climate-change. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.\n\nAn important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.\n\nOsang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the\nlines of Michael Porter's hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.\n\nCooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, guppies inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.\n\nVampire bats are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:\n\nIn addiction research / behavioral economics, George Ainslie points out that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict. In this case, \"defecting\" means \"relapsing\", and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome – in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been \"wasted\" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult). Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly \"better\" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining \"tomorrow\" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction. The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting \"today\", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.\n\nJohn Gottman in his research described in \"the science of trust\" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.\n\nAdvertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma. When cigarette advertising was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising. The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B. Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A. If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising. Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising. However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations. For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry. This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.\n\nWithout enforceable agreements, members of a cartel are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma. 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. Anti-trust authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for consumers.\n\nDoping in sport has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.\n\nTwo competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.\n\nIn international political theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of strategic realism, which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given international anarchy. A classic example is an arms race like the Cold War and similar conflicts. During the Cold War the opposing alliances of NATO and the Warsaw Pact both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.\n\nAlthough the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a war of attrition for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost. The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.\n\nMany real-life dilemmas involve multiple players. Although metaphorical, Hardin's tragedy of the commons may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the \"commons\"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house. By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.\n\nThe commons are not always exploited: William Poundstone, in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to take a paper without paying (\"defecting\") but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by Elinor Ostrom, winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the tragedy of the commons is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was \"closed bag exchange\":\nIn this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.\n\n\"Friend or Foe?\" is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the Game Show Network in the US. It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the \"both defect\" and the \"cooperate while the opponent defects\" cases are identical. This makes the \"both defect\" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote \"Foe\", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, \"Friend or Foe\" has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the game of Chicken.\n\nThe rewards matrix is\nThis payoff matrix has also been used on the British television programmes \"Trust Me\", \"Shafted\", \"The Bank Job\" and \"Golden Balls\", and on the American shows \"Bachelor Pad\" and \"Take It All\". Game data from the \"Golden Balls\" series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was \"surprisingly high\" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.\n\nResearchers from the University of Lausanne and the University of Edinburgh have suggested that the \"Iterated Snowdrift Game\" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a chicken game, it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a snowdrift, each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.\n\nThis may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. \"But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project.\"\n\nSeveral software packages have been created to run prisoner's dilemma simulations and tournaments, some of which have available source code.\n\nHannu Rajaniemi set the opening scene of his \"The Quantum Thief\" trilogy in a \"dilemma prison\". The main theme of the series has been described as the \"inadequacy of a binary universe\" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector. Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in mathematical physics – the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a \"post-singularity\" future. The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, \"The Fractal Prince\" and \"The Causal Angel\", published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nA game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game \"\" and a minor part in its 2016 sequel \"\".\n\nIn \"The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma\" by Trenton Lee Stewart, the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the \"prison\" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.\n\n\n"}

The military also use a similar technique for planning night marches and/or patrols.\n\nThe planned route is broken down into discrete sections termed \"legs\" or \"stages\". Whenever possible, each leg will start and finish at a clearly defined topographical feature such as a lake, knoll, saddle, stream junction and so on. In most cases the legs are defined as being the longest section that might be safely followed on a single compass bearing. The object is to split the overall route into sections that can be readily undertaken in conditions of poor visibility such as in cloud, fog or at night.\n\nIn addition to the compass bearing, for each leg the total distance will be measured as well as the height gained or lost and the steepness of the ground. Using this information an estimated time to complete the leg will be calculated usually using Naismith's Rule or one of its variations. These times are then added to estimate the total time needed for the expedition.\n\nFor each leg note may also be taken of potential sources of danger along the route such as cliffs or of handrail/collecting features to aid in confirming the route.\n\nFor formal expeditions or excursions the leader may include the following information.\n\n\nA copy of the route card is then left with a responsible person so as to assist the emergency services in the event that the group should suffer a mishap. This also avoids groups being reported as missing prematurely or without due cause.\n\nIn typical use, the route card will not be followed exactly by the party leader but is used as a backup if conditions deteriorate. When following legs on a compass bearing, the estimated time is not usually used as a precise indicator of when the leg is over but as a kind of fail-safe to stop the group from overshooting the actual objective and getting lost. If a precise estimate is needed, pace-counting may be used instead if terrain permits. Nowadays, it is typical to enter the co-ordinates from the route card into a handheld GPS unit and use this in conjunction with a compass if conditions deteriorate. In some cases, each member of the expedition may memorize a section of the route and have their own compass preset to the relevant bearing. This is a particular technique for military night patrols where the soldiers each lead a section of the route.\n\nMilitary use these to assist a planned route for night navigation same as a route card.\n\nIt is very simply a route card just showing the legs or stages of the route. Some commanders have a full detailed route card as well as the moon route card when doing night navigation. \n\nThe two reasons for this is that you can pull the Moon card out on the march and hold it up to the moon light to check the bearing or grid reference of the next leg, and to stop you getting out your torch and giving your position away.\n\n"}

He was succeeded by Gibraltarian Captain Bob Sanguinetti.\n\nRoy Henry Stanbrook, a native of Surrey, England, was born in 1957. The mariner indicates that he \"ran away to sea as a boy.\" His education included the Greenwich Royal Naval College and the Warsash School of Navigation (1975-1979). His early career included service in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) aboard the RFA \"Sir Galahad\" (1966) during the Falklands War (1982) and other conflict areas, during which he qualified as a Master Mariner. Stanbrook also served in the first Gulf War. He gained additional maritime experience in the fields of underwater engineering, education, marine insurance, and vessel management. He was employed by BT Marine, working on cable ships. At Warsash Maritime Academy, part of Southampton Solent University, Stanbrook taught radar, vessel handling, and bridge team management, and became a Senior Lecturer. He was a surveyor for the protection and indemnity insurance (P&I) club, British Marine Mutual. In addition, he was Operations Director for the Rochester-based shipping company, R Lapthorn and Company Ltd, his last position before joining the Port of London Authority (PLA).\n\nIn 2001, Stanbrook was appointed as the Deputy Harbour Master on the River Thames for the Lower District of the Port of London Authority. In 2007, he was selected as Harbour Master for the Lower District of the Port of London Authority, the area of his responsibility the lower tidal Thames. He succeeded Gordon Dickins, who retired from the Port of London Authority after having served in a number of senior positions over a period of 32 years. Stanbrook was in an advanced development programme at the Cranfield School of Management of Cranfield University in 2007-2008. On 27 February 2012, the 54-year-old assumed his most recent position, that of Chief Executive of the Gibraltar Port Authority and Captain of the Port. The selection process was completed in November of the previous year. His predecessor in Gibraltar was Captain Peter W.

He is a Younger Brother of Trinity House, the General Lighthouse Authority for England, Wales, the Channel Islands, and Gibraltar. He has an STCW (Standards of Training, Certification & Watchkeeping) Master Unlimited Certificate of Competency. On 19 March 2010, Stanbrook was appointed as a director of the Cambria Trust, the charity that owns the Thames sailing barge \"Cambria\". He has resided in Rochester, Kent, England.\n\nNeil Costa, Minister for Tourism, Public Transport and the Port, and chairman of the board of directors of the Gibraltar Port Authority, commented on his selection of Stanbrook to lead the Gibraltar Port Authority. \"The Government is determined to see growth and development in the various sectors of port operations and will be looking to the Captain to provide the necessary leadership to achieve this.\" In Gibraltar, the commercial port's primary activity is bunkering; Alan Cubbin of the Gibraltar Maritime Administration has noted improvement to the process of booking bunkering slots at Gibraltar in 2012. \"A year ago, it wasn’t unusual for ships to sit out for 24 hours whereas now, they’re booking three days ahead and it’s very efficient.\"\n\n"}

Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.\n\nSectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.\n\nThe colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Bouyage system that is designed by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities:\nA ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.\n\nThe world has different navigation stereotypes managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is \"red right returning\".\nAn example of a sector light is the light of the Fisgard Lighthouse in British Columbia. The lighthouse as built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely.

The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon. The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°.

It is the oldest of the surviving Pall Mall clubs and one of the most exclusive, having been established in 1819. It was described as \"the quintessential English gentleman's club\" by the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 2004.\n\nThe original concept of the club, by Lord Castlereagh and others, dates from the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars. They envisaged a club where gentlemen who travelled abroad might meet and offer hospitality to distinguished foreign visitors. The original rules of 1819 excluded from membership anyone \"“who has not travelled out of the British islands to a distance of at least five hundred miles from London in a direct line”\".\n\nThe members of the club's first Committee included the Earl of Aberdeen (later Prime Minister), Lord Auckland (after whom Auckland, New Zealand is named), the Marquess of Lansdowne (who had already served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and later refused office as Prime Minister) and Viscount Palmerston (later Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister).\n\nSubsequent members included statesmen and travellers such as Prime Minister George Canning, the Duke of Wellington, Lord John Russell, Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home, Francis Beaufort (creator of the Beaufort scale), Robert FitzRoy of HMS \"Beagle\", Sir William Edward Parry (explorer of the Northwest Passage), Sir Roderick Murchison (after whom the Murchison crater on the Moon is named) and Sir Wilfred Thesiger. Novelist Anthony Powell was a member, and the club is featured in various guises in the work of Graham Greene, Jules Verne, William Makepeace Thackeray and John le Carré.\n\nThe club's members include members of the British and foreign royal families, the British Foreign Secretary whilst in office, and various ambassadors to London; a tradition still continued today and there is also a special category of membership for particularly distinguished travellers, explorers and travel writers. Such well-known current members include Field Marshal Lord Bramall, and Terry Waite. Its membership remains exclusive, although there are a number of connections with other clubs throughout the world whose members may use its premises from time to time.\n\nJustin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, announced in 2014 that he would resign from the club, owing to its refusal to admit women.\n\nThe club's original premises were at 12 Waterloo Place. It moved to 49 Pall Mall in 1821 (a building which had once been occupied by Brooks's). However, it quickly outgrew this building and in 1826 the members decided to spend £25,000 on the construction of a purpose built club house on the present site at 106 Pall Mall, backing onto Carlton gardens.\n\nThe architect was Sir Charles Barry who was later to be the architect for the Houses of Parliament, and the Travellers Club building proved to be one of his masterpieces. It takes the form of a Renaissance palace which is said to have been inspired by Raphael's Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence. It was completed in 1832, with the tower (which had been in Barry's original design) added in 1842.\n\nThe club building includes a smoking room (a large common room which looks over Carlton Gardens), the cocktail bar and adjacent Bramall room (which gives access to Carlton Gardens), the Outer Morning Room (a large drawing room overlooking Pall Mall, and connecting to an Inner Morning Room), and the dining room (known as the Coffee Room). \"The Times\" on 10 January 2004 noted \"the wonderful dining, heavy on fish and game (partridges to potted shrimps) with echoes of public school food (bread pudding) and a superb wine cellar\".\n\nThe magnificent library is decorated with a cast of the Bassae Frieze from the 5th century BCE Greek temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae. The originals of this frieze were discovered by the architect Charles Robert Cockerell, who was on the first Committee of the Club in 1819, and they are now in the British Museum. The library has a large and important collection of books, from the antiquarian to the modern, mainly on travel.\n\nThere are a number of bedrooms at the club for out-of-town members.

This is within about 1° of the position of Polaris, so that the star would appear to trace a tiny circle in the sky each sidereal day. Due to the axial precession of Earth, true north rotates in an arc with respect to the stars that takes approximately 25,000 years to complete. Around 2100–02, Polaris will make its closest approach to the celestial north pole (extrapolated from recent Earth precession). The visible star nearest the north celestial pole 5,000 years ago was Thuban.\n\nOn maps published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the United States Armed Forces, true north is marked with a line terminating in a five-pointed star. The east and west edges of the USGS topographic quadrangle maps of the United States are meridians of longitude, thus indicating true north (so they are not exactly parallel). Maps issued by the United Kingdom Ordnance Survey contain a diagram showing the difference between true north, grid north, and magnetic north at a point on the sheet; the edges of the map are likely to follow grid directions rather than true, and the map will thus be truly rectangular/square.\n\n"}

Its importance lies in the improvement over considering the individual sources of information separately, where none on its own provides an adequate summary.\n\nThe two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is a special case of a gravity model of spatial interaction that was developed to measure spatial accessibility to primary care physicians. 2SFCA can also be used to measure other accessibility such as accessibility to jobs, to cancer care facilities, etc. It was inspired by the spatial decomposition idea first proposed by Radke and Mu (2000).\n\nThe 2SFCA method not only has most of the advantages of a gravity model, but is also intuitive to interpret, as it uses essentially a special form of physician-to-population ratio. It is easy to implement in a GIS environment. In essence, the 2SFCA method measures spatial accessibility as a ratio of primary-care physicians to population, combining two steps:\n\nIt has been recently enhanced by considering distance decay within catchments and called the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method.\n\nFurthermore, the use of capping certain services according to nearby population size,can improve the accuracy when analyzing across areas of different environments (i.e. rural and urban).\n\nThe method has been applied to other related public health issues, such as access to healthy food retailers.\n\n\n"}
