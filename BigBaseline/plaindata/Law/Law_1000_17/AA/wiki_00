{"id": "24189366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24189366", "title": "A Failure of Capitalism", "text": "A Failure of Capitalism\n\nA Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression is a non-fiction book by the economist Richard Posner. The text was initially published on May 1, 2009 by Harvard University Press. Posner criticizes President George W. Bush and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis, and moves away from his past well-known advocacy of free-market capitalism. The book has been primarily noted not for his criticism of progressive government policies (which he attacks again for good measure), but rather his critique of laissez-faire capitalism and its ideologues.\n\nThe book has been received with generally good reviews from the press, including \"The New York Times\", but the reception has not been universally positive.\n\nThe primary argument of the book is that we have gone from a recession into a depression (the \"D\" word, as one author calls it) in 2009, and Posner suggests several possible short-term and long-term solutions to this fiscal crisis. His thesis is not that government, politicians, or even bankers primarily caused this depression, but rather that the capitalist system is to blame for its own faults.\n\nSome of the causes of the depression that Posner cites are the lack of enforceable usury laws, which would discourage risky loans, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and central banks taking risks, securitization of mortgages, illiquidity and insolvency of the banking system, the housing bubble, blindness to warning signs of a crisis, and the preconceptions of ideology.\n\nPosner wraps up the book with a chapter containing several suggestions, including eventual re-regulation of the banking industry, but warns that \"this is not the time\" to do so — a long-term solution after the economy recovers — that can \"wait calmer days.\" He also suggests putting off reorganization of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve until a later time. In the meanwhile, he writes, \"piecemeal reforms may be feasible and helpful.\" These include a halt on government marketing of home ownership, requiring banks and financial institutions to \"disclose the \"full\" compensation of all senior executives\", backloading of compensation, increasing marginal income tax rates on the highest incomes, and usury laws to discourage risky loans.\n\nThe book is significant in Posner's criticism of President George W. Bush and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis. Part of the shock is due to Posner's longtime \"conservative\" views. Judge Posner was nominated to the Seventh Circuit by Ronald Reagan, but is \"no party man.\"\n\nPosner starts his criticism of Bush with a broad attack on his behavior in his final months as President:\nPosner blames Bush for pushing policies, such as the \"ownership society\", a $10 trillion national debt and \"the huge budget deficits run by the Bush administration\", \"prop[ping] up stock prices by keeping interest rates low,\" which were underlying causes of the crisis, as well as \"Dithering\" in late 2008. By the \"ownership society\", Posner referred to the American Dream Down Payment Act of 2003 and other laws that made ownership easier.\n\nPosner points out that Bush's proposed privatization of Social Security would have made the depression even more harmful. Posner states that one of the \"lessons learned\" is that the \"blurred\" line between \"the government and the private sector ... in the Bush Administration\" contributed to a lack of insight into the underlying problems. Even more so, \"the emphatically pro-business philosophy of the Bush administration made the SEC too trusting of the securities industry.\" The bottom line is that \"there might not have been a depression had it not been for the Bush administration's mismanagement of the economy.\"\n\nPosner, famous for his advocacy of free markets, turns on free-market capitalism in this book: \"the financial crisis is indeed a crisis of capitalism rather than a failure of government.\" Posner explicitly states that he has changed his mind, that in the words of economist Robert Lucas, \"that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded.\" Posner states that:\nPosner points out that one of the causes of the depression was \"blindness to warning signs\" of a crisis. A few people had warned of problems, including Nouriel Roubini, and Brooksley Born, but they were ignored. He asserts that the \"depression is a failure of capitalism\".\n\nThis is the second and most powerful shock. The \"New York Times\" points out that:\nPosner also assigns part of the blame for the recession on the administration of Bill Clinton. He says they were to blame for pushing policies that created the housing bubble. The training and experience of several Clinton advisors, notably Robert Rubin, were tilted towards Wall Street, which he found to be ultimately dangerous. Likewise, Alan Greenspan, Clinton's appointee as chairman of the Federal Reserve, gets a special blame for pushing low interest rates, which increased stock prices and led, in turn, to the bubbles in banking, stocks, and housing.\n\nPosner sweeps a wide swath in assigning portions of blame for causing the underlying recession on a variety of factors and persons. He praises the use of specific deterrence in shaming debtors, which, in his mind, has not been used enough recently. He faults the concept of limited liability for increasing risk. He points out the harmful focus on short-term profits at the expenses of long-term stability. Bad credit was, in Posner's words, given a \"so what?\" attitude.\n\nClinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress encouraged home ownership by people who had bad credit and should have, in Posner's view, remained tenants. Competition in the banking industry led to deregulation in Clinton's administration, and enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which increased risk to the system. Posner is not alone in criticizing the \"Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\"; some economists, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz also believe it helped create the 2007 financial crisis. Encouraging the practice of \"sweeps\" by large investors (removing money from demand deposits into money market funds overnight) exacerbated the problem.\n\nPreconceptions and ideology held by both sides of the spectrum, argues the book, prevented novel challenges to changing fiscal realities. Macroeconomics has not made use of chaos theory, and thus says Posner, the \"signal-noise ratio\" prevented a clear analysis and even created \"blindness\" and \"misinformation\" for policy analysts.\n\nPosner went on the record against \"how\" Barack Obama's administration's Keynesian stimulus in the ARRA \"could have been better designed,\" and specifically demurs against some of Obama's statements:\nNonetheless, Posner points out that what is rational for an individual corporation may not be rational for the industry as a whole.\n\nReviewing for \"The New York Times\", Jonathan Rauch wrote that:\nThe \"Huffington Post\" gave a long review, noting with a bit of \"schadenfreude\" that Posner had changed his views. Michael Casey, in a review published in the \"Irish Times\", writes \"Blaming the system is a cop-out... Posner’s approach is far too deterministic\", and further calls the book \"[a]n incomplete analysis of a floundering social system.\"\n\nIn the \"Washington Post\", Paul M. Barrett, an assistant managing editor of \"Business Week\", writes that Posner seems to spread the blame too much, denigrates mere stupidity and \"greed\" as causes, and lacks \"constructive proposals for reform...\" Barrett points out how notable this book is, which is that \"his critique is bracing, all the more so because it comes from a right-leaning thinker normally hostile to the ministrations of government bureaucrats.\"\n\nThe \"New York Review of Books\" said that \"it is at best a partial success; it gets some things right and some things wrong, and the items on both sides of the ledger are important.\" In the \"Review\", Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Solow praises the author quite faintly:\n\nSolow's review itself was notable to some degree, according to Brad DeLong, who critiqued Posner's logic along the way:\n\nIn an interview with \"The Economist\", Posner was forced to defend his use of the term \"depression\" and his move \"to the centre...\"\n\n\"Forbes\" magazine printed the preface of the book as a measure of its importance.\n\nIn January 2010, \"The New Yorker\" revisited \"A Failure of Capitalism\", noting that by September 2009, Posner had become a confirmed Keynesian: \"As acts of betrayal go, this was roughly akin to Johnny Damon's shaving off his beard, forsaking the Red Sox Nation, and joining the Yankees.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law. \nIn the course of EU accession negotiations Croatia harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.\nCroatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations. However, despite the improvements of the legal framework regulating access to public information, problems remain in the implementation, especially for journalists willing to request and obtain information from the government.\nIn Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution. It is regulated by the Law on the Right to Access Information adopted by the Croatian Parliament in 2013. The Law also regulates the re-use of information held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.\nAccording to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.\nThe Croatian law on Access to public information is in informed by four principles:\n\nPublic bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.\nFor the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an Information Commissioner, a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.\n\nPublic authority bodies may restrict access to information if:\nMoreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.\nThe public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.\nPublic authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.\nApplicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.\nAccess to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.\nAuthorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) \nIf the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.\nAgainst the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. \nNo complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.\nThe Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.\n\nThe Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.\nOne of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.\nAnother problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner Anamarija Musa - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century. Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares. Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.\nIn Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "56442904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56442904", "title": "Act on the Institute of National Remembrance", "text": "Act on the Institute of National Remembrance\n\nThe Act on the Institute of National Remembrance – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation () is a 1998 Polish law that created the Institute of National Remembrance. This memory law was amended twice, in 2007 and 2018.\n\nThe 1998 Act's Article 55 criminalizes historical negationism of crimes committed against Poles or Polish citizens by Nazi or Communist polities; of crimes against peace or humanity; of war crimes; and of political repression—all these being listed in Sections 1a and 1b of Article 1. While Holocaust denial is not \"explicitly\" mentioned, it is understood to be \"implicity\" criminalized.\n\nThe 2007 amendment dealt with lustrations conducted in Poland.\n\nThe 2018 amendment made further changes, including the addition of Article 55a, which makes it a crime to \"ascribe Nazi crimes to the Polish Nation or to the Polish State\"; and Article 2a, concerning crimes perpetrated against Poland or Poles by Ukrainian nationalists. The amendment caused an international controversy.\n\nThe Institute of National Remembrance was established by a Sejm Act of 18 December 1998.\n\nThe Act's article 55 criminalized \"public denial, against the facts, of Nazi crimes, communist crimes, and other offenses constituting crimes against peace, crimes against humanity or war crimes, committed against persons of Polish nationality or against Polish citizens of other nationalities between 1 September 1939 and 31 July 1990\"; and is therefore sometimes restrictively referred to as the \"law against Holocaust denial.\n\nIn 1999 an Opole University history professor, Dariusz Ratajczak, was tried under Article 55 for his Holocaust denial, was found guilty, and was sentenced to a year's probation.\n\nThe 2007 amendment dealt with lustrations conducted in Poland.\n\nThe 2018 amendment, intended \"to eliminate public misattribution to the Polish Nation or the Polish State of responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the German Third Reich\", was signed into law by President Andrzej Duda on 6 February 2018. The Amendment will come into force in 3 months after its signing.\n\nArticle 55a, referred to by critics variously as the \"Polish Holocaust bill\", the \"Poland Holocaust law\", etc., has caused international controversy. Critics fear that Article 55a poses an obstacle to free discussion of historical facts about the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nArticle 2a, dealing with crimes perpetrated against Poland or Poles by Ukrainian nationalists, caused controversy in Ukraine.\n\nA 2006 law with some of the same aims, Article 132a of the Polish Penal Code, was passed in 2006, but was invalidated in 2008.\n\nAfter a period of lobbying, the first version of the 2018 Amendment was drafted on 17 February 2016 by Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro. On 30 August 2016 the Council of Ministers, presided over by Prime Minister Beata Szydło, forwarded the draft to the Sejm.\nThe principal rationale given at the submission of the first draft was that diplomatic and public interventions against use of the misleading term \"Polish death camp\" and the like had proven ineffective. Therefore, it had been decided to create a legal instrument for \"counteracting the falsification of Polish history and for protecting the good name of Polish citizens.\" Thus a new type of crime had been defined, \"consisting in the attribution to Polish citizens, in public and against the facts, of the organizing, participation in, or responsibility or co-responsibility for crimes committed by Nazi Germany.\" This was immediately criticized internationally as an attempt to suppress discussion of crimes that had been committed during the Holocaust by Polish citizens.\n\nJournalist Jerzy Haszczyński, writing in the Polish newspaper \"Rzeczpospolita\", observed that, when the expression \"Polish death camp\" appeared in foreign media, it \"insidiously suggested that our state and our people were responsible for German crimes\"; but he was not sure whom the proposed law would affect. \"Almost every use of the expression that I can recall ended in a profuse apology.\"\n\nThe addition of the \"ban of propaganda of Banderism\" to the law (Article 2a) was spearheaded by the right-wing political movement Kukiz'15. Kukiz'15 submitted this addition on July 16, 2016, however it was blocked by Civic Platform and Law and Justice parties citing \"the good of Polish-Ukrainian relations\". Eventually, Article 2a was added to the bill on 25 January 2018 during the second reading.\n\nOn 26 January 2018, after the bill's third reading, the Polish Parliament's lower chamber, the Sejm, approved the bill, which would apply to Poles as well as to foreigners. On 1 February 2018 the upper chamber, the Senate, passed the bill without amendment. On 6 February 2018 President Andrzej Duda signed the bill into law.\n\nSome parts of the law will come into effect 14 days after its registration in \"Dziennik Ustaw\" (the Register of Statutes), with the full law coming into effect within 3 months. The law is also being referred to the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland for review of its compliance with the Polish Constitution.\n\nThe bill was interpreted across Israel's political spectrum as promoting the denial of historic facts. Some Israelis went so far as to accuse the Polish government of Holocaust denial.\n\nOn February 8, 2018, the Polish government initiated an online propaganda effort supporting the law, using social media efforts to spread messages supporting the law, and broadcasting advertisements in Poland as well as Israel and the United States. Hashtags such as \"#GermanDeathCamps\" and \"#PolishRighteousness\" were spread by government accounts, and a viral video was made that is currently being spread via Google, Facebook and Twitter. \nIn a 24 February 2017 interview, Poland’s Justice Minister and Prosecutor-General Zbigniew Ziobro indicated that the law would not be enforced until it was cleared by the Constitutional Tribunal. This was quickly misinterpreted by Israeli media as meaning that the law had been \"frozen\".\n\nAccording to an opinion poll conducted in February 2018, 51% of Poles opposed the 2018 amendment.\n\nAccording to a communiqué of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an example of such misattribution is the use of expressions such as \"Polish death camps\". The communiqué further states: \n\nThe amended act provides for a penalty, in precisely defined [circumstance]s, for the purpose of preventing intentional defamation of Poland. The final determination of a specific case will rest with the courts. \nThe provisions of the amended act [shall] not limit freedom of research, discussion of history, or artistic activity.\nThe proposed law modifies a previous law relating to the Institute of National Remembrance (namely, the Act of 18 December 1998 on the – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (Dz.U. 1998 nr 155 poz. 1016)).\n\nThe following additions caused most international controversy.\n\n\n1. [Anyone] who, in public and against the facts, ascribes to the Polish Nation or to the Polish State, responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich, [as] defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis, signed in London on August 8, 1945 [...], or for other offences which are crimes against peace [or] humanity or [that are] war crimes, or who otherwise grossly reduces the responsibility of the actual perpetrators of said crimes, is subject to a fine or [to] imprisonment for up to 3 years. The judgment shall be made public.\n\n2. If a perpetrator of the act referred to in paragraph 1 has acted unintentionally, [such person] shall be subject to a fine or community sentence [()].\n\n3. No offense referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall have been committed if the act was performed as part of artistic or scholarly activity.\n\nRegardless of locally binding regulations at the place at which the forbidden act took place, this law applies to Polish citizens as well as to foreigners in the case that a crime occurs as described by Articles 55 and 55a.\n\nThe crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German Reich, as defined in the Act, are acts committed by Ukrainian nationalists in the years 1925-1950, involving the use of violence, terror or other forms of violation of human rights, against individuals or ethnic groups. One of the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German Reich is their involvement in the extermination of the Jewish population and genocide on citizens of the Second Polish Republic in Volhynia and Eastern Lesser Poland.\"\n\nThe first addition caused international controversy and contributed to a worsening of Israel-Poland relations.\n\nThe second addition contributed to worsening of Poland-Ukraine relations.\n\nArticle 55a was criticized for being an obstacle to free discussions of historical facts about the Holocaust in Poland. A letter signed by many prominent persons in early February, including Anne Appelbaum and the 3rd President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski, said: \"Why should the victims and witnesses of the Holocaust have to watch what they say for fear of being arrested, and will the testimony of a Jewish survivor who “feared Poles” be a punishable offence?\".\n\nEven before being passed, the law damaged the Israel–Poland relations. Israel's Foreign Ministry director-general Yuval Rotem reported that preserving the memory of the Holocaust takes priority over international relations. He said that \"Preserving the memory of the Holocaust is a matter beyond the bilateral relationship between Israel and Poland. It is a core issue cutting to the essence of the Jewish people\". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Poland of Holocaust denial. Yair Lapid, a member of the Israeli Parliament, wrote on Twitter:\n\nDr. Efraim Zuroff, head of the Israel office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, stated that, though he opposes the bill, Lapid's remarks were not factually correct:\n\nYad Vashem condemned the Polish bill, saying that, while \"Polish death camps\" as a phrase is a historic misrepresentation, the legislation is \"liable to blur the historical truths regarding the assistance the Germans received from the Polish population during the Holocaust\". Others have pointed out that, beyond mere complicity, Poles themselves massacred Jews in the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom and in the post-war 1946 Kielce pogrom, among other incidents, and that the law would outlaw mention of these events as well. According to Israeli education minister Naftali Bennett, \"It is a historic fact that many Poles aided in the murder of Jews, handed them in, abused them, and even killed Jews during and after the Holocaust\", and \"It is also a historic fact that the Germans initiated, planned, and built the work and death camps in Poland. That is the truth, and no law will rewrite it.\" Bennett instructed schools to teach about the Polish role in the Holocaust.\n\nIn the U.S., Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed \"disappointment\" in the bill, adding: \"Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry.\"\n\nThe Polish League Against Defamation filed a complaint against the Argentine newspaper Página/12, a few hours after the amendment came into force. The complaint is about an article from December 2017, which illustrated the Jedwabne pogrom with a photo of the \"Cursed soldiers\". According to the group, the article was \"intended to harm the Polish nation and the good reputation of Polish soldiers\" and \"by issuing such a statement, the publisher showed great historical ignorance for which he should officially apologize to all Poles\". The article had been published before the amendment of the law, and it is unclear how it would be enforced against foreign outlets. The group did not address whether a retroactive enforcement of law was valid. Página/12 reported that they had not been formally notified, and published interviews with Argentine Jews that escaped from Poland during the Holocaust, such as Diana Wang, president of an organization that represents Holocaust survivors and their descendants in Argentina. Other Argentine newspapers showed their support by republishing the article. The secretary for Human Rights Claudio Avruj said that \"No law can limit, condemn or prevent freedom of expression or limit research\".\n\nJeffrey Kopstein of the University of Toronto and Jason Wittenberg of the University of California, Berkeley, authors of the book, \"Intimate Violence: Anti-Jewish Pogroms on the Eve of the Holocaust\", about anti-Jewish violence in Poland such as the Szczuczyn pogrom, opine that the purpose of the new bill \"is clear: to restrict discussion of Polish complicity.\" They also suggest that \"Poland’s current government will likely face the unpalatable prospect of enforcing an unenforceable law and denying what the mainstream scholarly community has increasingly shown to be true: Some Poles were complicit in the Holocaust.\".\n\nProf. Stanislaw Krajewski of the Warsaw University, who co-chairs the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, said that \"The way the law is formulated makes it a blunt instrument for paralysing and punishing anyone you don't like\", and that \"the government's harsh, dismissive reaction to critics has encouraged many people to think they can now attack Jews.\"\n\nOn 5 March 2018, in front of the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw and Wrocław, 45 Polish citizens made public statements referring to historical events, including the Jedwabne pogrom and the Szczuczyn pogrom. The citizens claimed that they attributed responsibility for the events and alleged that their public statements constituted criminal acts under Article 55a of the amended Act of the Institute of National Memory. In the Prosecutors' offices, the citizens deposited formal written documents reporting their alleged crimes.\n\nIn late March 2018, an Israeli mayor Eli Dukorsky of Kiryat Bialik, who planned to deliver a speech during an event in Poland had been asked by local Polish municipal authorities to submit his speech in advance prior to its being delivered in the Israeli mayor's Polish sister city, Radomsko. According to Dukorsky, subsequently Polish authorities were unwilling to accept portions of the speech that referred to Polish complicity in the Holocaust, in particular the estimate that Poles killed 200,000 Jews, and accounts from Holocaust survivors. According to Radomsko Mayor Jarosław Ferenc, \"some of the content was historically unproven\"; among other things, the claims that \"Polish farmers killed 200,000 Jews during the war, and that of the six million Jews who were murdered, 200,000 were killed by Poles\", were unacceptable. Some media reports have described this event as a \"de facto\" censorship, and a chilling effect related to the new law.\n\nIn April 2018, Polish nationalists called for the investigation of Israeli president Reuven Rivlin for his remarks at Auschwitz concentration camp in which he reportedly told Polish president Andrzej Duda \"that Poland allowed the implementation of Germany's genocide\" according to National Movement Vice President Krzysztof Bosak. According to Bosak, \"it would be unacceptable if Rivlin asserted that Poland bears any responsibility for the Holocaust\", with Bosak saying that his group was testing the enforcement of the new law.\n\nIn late June 2018 the article was amended, making the offending statements civil, instead of criminal, offences. The prime ministers of Poland and Israel issued a joint declaration endorsing research into the Jewish Holocaust and condemning the expression, \"Polish concentration camps\".\n\nThe Amendment's passage worsened Polish-Ukrainian relations, already contentious on the questions of the prewar Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the wartime and postwar Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych have been considered Ukrainian national heroes in Ukraine, and war criminals in Poland. In Ukraine, the Amendment has been called \"the Anti-Banderovite Law\".\n\nThe director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance, Volodymyr Viatrovych, asserts that the Amendment's principal target is Ukrainians residing in Poland.\n\nThe Polish law has been compared to Ukrainian Law 2538-1, passed in 2015.\n\n\n"}

It is a form of disorderly conduct.\n\nDisturbing the peace is a crime generally defined as the unsettling of proper order in a public space through one's actions. This can include creating loud noise by fighting or challenging to fight, disturbing others by loud and unreasonable noise (including loud music), or using profanity.\n\nDisturbing the peace is typically considered a misdemeanour or an infraction depending on the jurisdiction and is often punishable by either a fine or a brief term in jail. On other rare occasions, it is considered an ordinance violation, the lowest level of offence. In most Commonwealth jurisdictions, a person held in breach of the peace will not have a criminal record entered against their name, which record could otherwise hurt the person's employment prospects (often seriously) and could adversely affect how he or she is viewed and treated by law-enforcement authorities, e.g., what if any bond he or she is granted if arrested in the future.\n\nA violation of a noise ordinance is in most jurisdictions not considered a disturbance of the peace unless the perpetrator has disregarded an affirmative request that he or she reduce the noise to a reasonable level.\n\nStandards for whether to charge someone with disturbance of the peace are highly subjective, and in many jurisdictions, courts are highly deferential to the opinion of the arresting/charging officer as to whether the accused's actions violated the law (even though in theory the officer's testimony addresses only questions of fact, whereas questions of the law's applicability to those facts are left to the trying court alone). Many local ordinances prohibiting disturbance of the peace exhibit a problematic degree of vagueness, occasionally to the point that courts deem them unconstitutional (in United States law) or violative of due process (in both United States and Commonwealth jurisdictions).\n\nIn the United States, the Speech or Debate Clause of Article One of the United States Constitution provides that members of Congress shall be immune from arrest in going to and departing from sessions and while Congress is in session except for cases of \"Treason, Felony, and Breach of the Peace.\" The first two are somewhat self-explanatory; it has been suggested that the third is deliberately somewhat vague. The doctrine thus established is called \"congressional immunity\"; it arose out of the necessity to prevent a vengeful executive from arresting members of the legislature under a pretext to prevent them from taking actions that the executive might find to be displeasing. In recent years, this doctrine has been used to prevent members from being stopped and held for speeding on their way to sessions; this apparently is not a \"breach of the peace\", whereas perhaps another misdemeanour such as \"drunk and disorderly\" might be construed as such. Most states of the United States and most other English-speaking jurisdictions have extended this privilege to members of their legislatures on the theory outlined above.\n\n\"Cox v. Louisiana\" was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that a Louisiana statute criminalizing breaches of the peace \"as authoritatively interpreted by the Louisiana Supreme Court is unconstitutionally broad in scope\". The statute read in part:\n\nIn Terminiello v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court held that a \"breach of peace\" ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which \"stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance\" was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Justice Douglas stated: \"Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”\n\nIn England and Wales, theoretically all criminal offences cognizable by English law involve \"a breach of the Queen's peace\", and all indictments formerly concluded \"against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity\" before the passage of the Indictments Act 1915 and the Rules that formed that Act's first schedule. The conclusion has also found its way into constitutional law in many United States state constitutions, which mandate that indictments within the state end in a similar manner to the above, usually omitting the \"crown\" part or substituting \"government\". For example, New Jersey's is \"against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same\".\n\nHistorically that concluding phrase, now legally superfluous, represents the last trace of the process by which the royal courts assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the sheriff and of lords of manor and franchises, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from civil wrongs or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of Justice of the Peace.\n\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, which refers to riotous and barratous behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as \"when a person reasonably believes harm will be caused, or is likely to be caused, to a person or in his presence to his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance\".\n\nThe breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the common law and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition \n\nSection 17(5) of PACE 1984 abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace. This \"offence\" definition and power of arrest are contained under the common law definition of \"breach of the peace\". Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws Alfred the Great consolidated into the common law approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the Justice of the Peace Act 1361. As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting as 'any person' and not fully as sworn officer in this capacity.\n\nThe power to arrest for a breach of the peace is usually used to remove violent, potentially violent or provocative offenders (it is not necessary for the offender themselves to be physically involved in any violence) from a scene rapidly.\n\nIn England and Wales, breach of the peace is a civil proceeding (rather than a criminal offence), although the case must be proved to the criminal standard of proof, 'beyond reasonable doubt', rather than the civil standard of proof, 'on the balance of probabilities'. Sometimes the Crown Prosecution Service conduct the case on behalf of the police, but the police service is liable for any costs awarded in favour or against the prosecutor. Breach of the Peace is not an offence, in the sense that it is not punishable either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or common law and nor do proceedings for breach of the peace give rise to any conviction. In England and Wales, constables (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to \"prevent a further breach of the peace\" which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a breach of the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a Breach of the Peace would occur.\n\nThe only immediate sanction that can be imposed by a court for breach of the peace is to bind over the offender to keep the peace: that is, justices of the peace can require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace. Any punishment (in the sense of a loss of freedom or permanent financial penalty) takes the form of loss of the surety if the defendant fails to keep the peace or be of good behaviour during the period for which he is bound over. The binding over itself does not amount to a conviction (but any following behaviour causing loss of the surety might well result in conviction for an associated offence). A failure to enter into a recognizance may of itself lead to a person being committed to custody under s.115(3) Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.\n\nThere are major differences between English law and Scottish law with respect to dealing with breach of the peace; unlike England and Wales where criminal penalties apply to the behaviour leading to or liable to cause a breach of the peace, it is a specific criminal offence in Scotland which is prosecuted daily in the sheriff courts and due to its common law definition it can be applied to a number of scenarios. The maximum punishment if a case is remitted to the High Court remains imprisonment for life although such severe punishment is now rarely applied, usually being associated with breaches of licence during an existing life sentence.\n\nThe Scottish law definition of a breach of the peace is \"conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community\".\n\nA constable may arrest any person, without warrant, who commits a breach of the peace. A member of the public may not arrest a person for behaviour which amounts to no more than a breach of the peace (i.e. an arrest is not always for the offence for which someone is eventually prosecuted but can be for a more serious crime that appears to be occurring).\n\nBreach of the peace can include, but is not limited to, any riotous behaviours (which includes \"rowdiness\" or \"brawling\") and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour need not be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include voyeurism, persistently following someone, delivering \"threatening\" letters and \"streaking\" or \"mooning\".\n\nTo prove a breach of the peace, the most important things to prove are that someone was alarmed, annoyed or disturbed by the incident.\n\nThis offence can take place anywhere, for example, a public street or any public space.\n\nOne of the leading cases in Scottish Law is that of \"Smith v Donnelly\", a case concerning a Faslane protester.\n\n\n"}

The incident has since gone on to be cited in numerous legal writings and court cases involving digital copyright and the interests of corporations versus independent content producers.\n\nKnight graduated from Rockingham County Senior High School in 1992. He earned an Associate of Arts degree from Rockingham Community College. In 1999, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Historical Studies from Elon University.\n\nKnight ran for one of five new at-large seats on the Rockingham County, North Carolina Board of Education in 2006, and self-produced a series of television commercials for his campaign. Knight paid for airtime and the commercials were broadcast on WGSR Star 39 from Reidsville, North Carolina in the month leading up to the November 7 election.\n\nThe first commercial that Knight created, dubbed simply \"Christopher Knight for School Board Commercial #1\", played off the Star Wars movies. In the one-minute spot, the Death Star destroys a tiny red schoolhouse while a female voice actress describes how legislation like No Child Left Behind has turned the federal government into a \"cosmic bully\" that is \"targeting and destroying our ability to best teach our children\". The second half of the commercial features Knight wielding a blue-bladed lightsaber, describing how he is a \"fiscal conservative\" who wants more local control over the county's schools. The commercial ends with Knight twirling the lightsaber in a flourish as he vows \"to defend a bright and shining future for the children of Rockingham County\".\n\nKnight uploaded the commercial to YouTube, and it soon became noticed by a larger audience. In the weeks before the election, it was featured in many regional newspapers, was shown on the Fox News Channel and was mentioned in \"The New York Times\". By the end of the year, the \"Star Wars\" school board ad had aroused the attention of Edutopia, the magazine of the George Lucas Educational Foundation, which declared Knight's commercial to be the \"Best Campaign Ad Ever\".\n\nKnight aired two more commercials before the election, but he failed to win a seat. He came in 8th place out of 16 candidates who ran, which was the largest slate for a single race in Rockingham County history.\n\nOver the next several months, Knight's commercial was screened at the American Film Institute, and was featured on the Heritage Foundation website and in many other media outlets including \"The Jay Leno Show\", \"The Soup\", on MTV and numerous international programming.\n\nThe television program \"Web Junk 20\" on VH1 aired a special presentation titled \"Animals and Other Crap\" in July 2007. The show, which highlights funny and unusual video clips found on the Internet, showed Knight's first school board commercial along with commentary by host Aries Spears. Knight later said that no one from the network had approached him about using his commercial for a for-profit broadcast, or had even told him that it would be aired by the network. However, Knight also said that he thought that the show was so good and Spears' commentary to be so witty, that he didn't mind that VH1 used it at all. As he had done with his original commercial, Knight uploaded the \"Web Junk 20\" segment on YouTube so that he could share it with friends.\n\nOn August 29, 2007, YouTube notified Knight him that his video of the \"Web Junk 20\" clip had been taken down at the insistence of VH1's parent company Viacom, claiming Knight's use of the clip was copyright infringement and violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Upon being presented with the claim, YouTube had no choice but to pull it per DMCA mandate. Knight objected, as \"Web Junk 20\" had lifted his own material, and claimed that Viacom had violated his copyright first.\n\nKnight contended that per the Copyright Act of 1976, his uploading of the \"Web Junk 20\" clip featuring his own commercial satisfied the four criteria for fair use. and that VH1's segment was a derivative work of his own, since the \"Web Junk 20\" clip was based on Knight's original commercial and could not have existed without it. Viacom countered that the \"Web Junk 20\" clip was indeed its own copyrighted material, acknowledging that although it used the commercial that Knight had produced himself, that VH1 had added Aries Spears's image and commentary. Viacom asserted that this was enough to make the entire content of the \"Web Junk 20\" clip, including use of Knight's commercial, their own material protected under copyright.\n\nFollowing guidelines on YouTube's site, Knight filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act counter-notification claim, and per DMCA provisions, Viacom was legally bound to take one of two options: to take Knight to court and file a lawsuit against him for copyright infringement, or to let the video be restored on YouTube. After the story gained considerable press coverage, Viacom relented, and YouTube reinstated Knight's clip of \"Web Junk 20\" featuring his campaign commercial.\n\nThe incident has since been referenced in several other stories regarding YouTube and cases of possible copyright infringement, including that of the Lenz family's lawsuit against Universal regarding a clip they had posted onto YouTube that included several seconds of a song by musical artist Prince.\n\nAfter Viacom relented and dropped its claim, Knight asserted that he had no ill toward Viacom and asked his readers to do likewise. \"This ends just as I had hoped it would: with the clip back up and, I like to think, with Viacom and me getting to shake hands and move on and wishing each other well. I'll certainly harbor no hard feelings toward Viacom for the past two weeks.\"\n\nIn late 2010 Knight used his blog to go public about his longtime diagnosis of bipolar disorder. He has since devoted much effort toward sharing his experiences with severe depression, mania, and the treatment of his disease. As of 2015 Knight is writing a book about his life with mental illness.\n\nKnight and his filmmaking partner Ed Woody are the founders of KWerky Productions. Knight's first film \"Forcery -\" a parody of the film adaptation of the Stephen King novel \"Misery\" - was heavily featured in the award-winning documentary \"The People vs. George Lucas\".\n\nKnight is a published op-ed writer who maintains that he is extremely nonpartisan and asks to not be considered as either a conservative or a liberal. He had stated numerous times that he refuses to vote for or endorse any candidate who produces even a single negative campaign ad against an opponent, without exception.\n\nHe is active in community theatre and enjoys knifemaking. As of 2016 Knight is traveling across the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1798225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1798225", "title": "Compact theory", "text": "Compact theory\n\nCompact theory refers to two theories related to the development of federal constitutions. In the United States, it differs from the contract theory in that it favored the rights of states over those of the Federal Government.\n\nRegarding the Constitution of the United States, the compact theory holds that the country was formed through a compact agreed upon by all the states, and that the federal government is thus a creation of the states. Consequently, states should be the final arbiters over whether the federal government had overstepped the limits of its authority as set forth in the compact.\n\nLeading proponents of this view of the U.S. Constitution primarily originated from Virginia and other southern states. Notable proponents of the theory include Thomas Jefferson, Under this theory and in reaction to the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, Jefferson claimed the federal government overstepped its authority, and advocated nullification of the laws by the states. The first resolution of the Kentucky Resolutions began by stating:\nResolved, that the several States composing the United States of America, are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government; but that by compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States and of amendments thereto, they constituted a General Government for special purposes, delegated to that Government certain definite powers, reserving each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self Government; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party; that the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.\n\nOthers have taken the position that the federal government is not a compact among the states, but instead was formed directly by the people, in their exercise of their sovereign power. The people determined that the federal government should be superior to the states. Under this view, the states, which are not parties to the Constitution, do not have the right to determine for themselves the proper scope of federal authority, but instead are bound by the determinations of the federal government. The state of Vermont took this position in response to the Kentucky Resolutions. Daniel Webster advocated this view in his debate with Robert Hayne in the Senate in 1830:\n\n[I]t cannot be shown, that the Constitution is a compact between State governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; it, declares that it is ordained and established \"by the people of the United States\". So far from saying that it is established by the governments \"of the several States\", it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several States; but it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States, in the aggregate. . . . When the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between the States, he uses language exactly applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as States, were parties to it. We had no other general government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate to the public exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better. They undertook to form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a \"Constitution\"; a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it the name of a \"Constitution\", therein they established a distribution of powers between this, their general government, and their several State governments.\n\nThe leading nineteenth century commentary on the Constitution, Justice Joseph Story's \"Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States\" (1833), likewise rejected the compact theory, concluding that the Constitution was established directly by the people, not by the states, and that it constitutes supreme law, not a mere compact.\n\nIn the years before the Civil War, the compact theory was used by southern states to argue that they had a right to nullify federal law and to secede from the union. For example, during the Nullification Crisis of 1828-1832, John C. Calhoun argued in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest that the states, as the parties to a compact, had the right to judge for themselves whether the terms of the compact were being honored. Calhoun described this \"right of judging\" as \"an essential attribute of sovereignty,\" which the states retained when the Constitution was formed. Calhoun said the states had the right to nullify, or veto, any laws that were inconsistent with the compact.\n\nWhen the southern states seceded in 1860-61, they relied on the compact theory to justify secession. The southern states argued that the northern states had violated the compact by undermining and attacking the institution of slavery and the slaveholders' property rights in their slaves. The southern states stated that they therefore were justified in withdrawing from the compact among the states.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states. Rather, the Court has stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people of the United States, not by the states.\n\nIn one of the Supreme Court's first significant decisions, \"Chisholm v. Georgia\" (1793), Chief Justice John Jay stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people. Jay noted the language of the Preamble of the Constitution, which says that the Constitution was ordained and established by \"We the people,\" and stated: \"Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound.\"\n\nIn \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\" (1816), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states, stating: \"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'\" The Court contrasted the earlier Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, characterizing the Articles of Confederation as a compact among states, while stating that the Constitution was established not by the states, but by the people.\n\nLikewise, in \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819), the Supreme Court stated that the federal Constitution proceeded directly from the people, and was not created by the states. The Court stated that the Constitution was binding on the states and could not be negated by the states. The Court again contrasted the Articles of Confederation, which was established by the states, to the Constitution, which was established by the people.\n\nAfter the Civil War, in \"Texas v. White\" (1869), a case discussing the legal status of the southern states that had attempted to secede, the Supreme Court stated that the union was not merely a compact among states; rather, the union was \"something more than a compact.\"\n\nIn the Canadian context, compact theory posits that Confederation was an agreement between the two founding peoples, French and English, and that therefore Quebec should have special veto powers relating to its position in the federal structure. However, compact theory was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1981 Patriation Reference. Compact theory is often advanced by Quebec nationalists.\n\n"}

However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a person who was \"aware\" that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation.\n\nCorporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business \"as if it were\" a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be estopped from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant.\n\nBoth doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort. The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.\n"}

Like most animals, when humans die, their bodies start to decompose, emitting a foul odor and attracting scavengers and decomposers. For these reasons, corpses must be disposed of properly. The problem of body disposal consists of two parts: disposal of the soft tissues, which will rapidly decompose, and of the skeleton, which will remain intact for thousands of years under certain conditions.\n\nSeveral methods for disposal are practiced. In many cases, the manner of disposal is dominated by spiritual concerns and a desire to show respect for the dead, and may be highly ritualized. This event may be part of a larger funeral ritual. In other circumstances, such as war or natural disaster, practical concerns may be forefront. Many religions as well as legal jurisdictions have set rules regarding the disposal of corpses. Since the experience of death is universal to all humans, practices regarding corpse disposal are a part of every culture. Ancient methods of disposing of dead bodies include cremation practised by the Romans, Greeks, and Hindus; burial practised by the Jews, Christians, and Muslims; mummification practised by the Ancient Egyptians; and the sky burial and a similar method of disposal called Towers of Silence practiced by Tibetan Buddhists and Zoroastrians.\n\nThe most common methods of disposal are:\n\n\nNew methods in development include promession (freeze-drying), and the mushroom death suit by Infinity Burial Project.\n\nIn some cases an attempt is made to preserve some or all of a body. These methods include:\n\nHuman remains of archaeological or medical interest are often kept in museums and private collections. This practice is controversial (See NAGPRA). In the cases of Native Americans in the United States, possession of remains and related objects is regulated by the NAGPRA Act of 1990.\n\nDifferent religions and cultures have various funeral rites that accompany the disposal of a body. Some require that all parts of the body are buried together. If an autopsy has occurred, removed parts of the body are sewn back into the body so that they may be buried with the rest of the corpse.\n\nWhen it is not possible for a body to be disposed of promptly, it is generally stored at a morgue. Where this is not possible, such as on a battlefield, body bags are used. In the Western world, embalming of the body is a standard part of preparation. This is intended to temporarily preserve the corpse throughout the funeral process.\n\nMany jurisdictions have enacted regulations relating to the disposal of human bodies. Although it may be entirely legal to bury a deceased family member, the law may restrict the locations in which this activity is allowed, in some cases expressly limiting burials to property controlled by specific, licensed institutions. Furthermore, in many places, failure to properly dispose of a body is a crime. In some places, it is also a crime to fail to report a death, and to fail to report the disposal of the body.\n\nCertain conditions such as necrosis can cause parts of the body such as limbs or internal organs to die without causing the death of the individual. In such cases the body parts are usually not given a funeral. Surgical removal of dead tissue is usually necessary to prevent gangrenous infection. Surgically removed body parts are typically disposed of as medical waste, unless they need to be preserved for cultural reasons, as described above.\n\nConversely, donated organs or tissue may live on long after the death of an individual.\n\nIn some cases, a body is disposed of in such a way as to prevent, hinder, or delay discovery of the body, to prevent identification of the body, or to prevent autopsy. In such cases, the deceased is considered a missing person as long as a body is not identified, unless death is so likely that the person is declared legally dead.\nThis often occurs as part of a murder or voluntary manslaughter. In other cases, an individual who did not intend to cause death may still feel guilt about a death (e.g. by involuntary manslaughter or an accident) and may attempt to prevent discovery of the body. This can exacerbate any legal consequences associated with the death.\nOther motives for concealing death or the cause of death include insurance fraud or the desire to collect the pension of the deceased. An individual may commit suicide in such a way as to obscure the cause of death, allowing beneficiaries of a life insurance policy to collect on the policy.\n\nCriminal methods encountered in fiction and actual cases include:\n\nDisposal of this type happens for various reasons, including the main difference between a burial at sea and a burial on land: the difficulty in recovering the body. Sometimes this difference is desired to dispose of bodies outside of the law.\n\nThere may be a number of reasons for this kind of crime. One common reason for this behavior is to dispose of the evidence. The body may be the victim of a homicide, as for example murder or manslaughter. In some cases, the victim may even be still alive and drowning during the process. A live victim is usually restrained to reduce the likelihood of the victim freeing themselves or fighting back, and the body is often weighted to ensure the sinking of the body. The Mafia is infamous for disposing of victims in oceans or lakes with their feet cast in a concrete block. Other variants tie concrete blocks or other heavy objects to the victim. The \"Chicago-style\" method involves wrapping heavy chains around the victim. In Venice, barrels filled with a human body and concrete are occasionally found in the canals. It is difficult to determine if murder victims buried in a swamp are buried in water or in earth. Often, the body is also cut up to reduce the likelihood of reappearing.\n\nIn other cases, the victim may have died from an accident, and another involved party tries to destroy evidence of the accident. There are also cases where a stillborn infant is buried to dispose of evidence of infidelity, or problems with fertility, or the shame associated with unwed parenthood in many cultures.\n\nWhile a corpse properly buried at sea is unlikely to reappear, many criminals are unable to ensure the permanent disposals of a body, and evidence of the body may reappear. This is rarely as spectacular as the freshly caught shark in the Sydney Coogee Aquarium that vomited up a surgically separated human arm, leading to a murder investigation. That victim was determined to be James Smith, but the three murder suspects were acquitted.\n\nMany criminals dispose of bodies in a river, hoping that the body is carried away. However, this method will most likely lead to a quick detection of the body, because the body gets entangled at the side of the river, or stopped at a dam, or is simply seen floating by others. A disposal in large lakes or oceans is more likely to hide the body, but a decomposing body can develop a strong positive buoyancy due to the decomposing gases being trapped underneath the skin. This may bring the body up to the surface, or at least increase the movement across the ocean floor due to wave actions. Many bodies have washed up at the shore. Bodies have also been discovered in the nets or lines of fishermen, and occasionally, bodies are also discovered by divers.\n\nVery cold water with little oxygen may even preserve bodies, allowing for an easier identification, as for example Margaret Hogg, the \"Wasdale Lady in the Lake\" in Wast Water lake in the Wasdale area (see National Trust Properties in England). She was found after 8 years, with her body preserved like wax.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "239253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239253", "title": "Execution by elephant", "text": "Execution by elephant\n\nExecution by elephant was a common method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power and his ability to control wild animals.\n\nThe sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.\n\nThe intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.\n\nHistorically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or \"mahout\", thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities. Several such exercises of mercy are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of Siam trained their elephants to roll the convicted person \"about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt\". The Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great is said to have \"used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives\". On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him. Elephants were occasionally used in trial by ordeal in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.\n\nThe use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.\n\nExecution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.\n\nElephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in Burma and Malaysia from the earliest historical times as well as in the kingdom of Champa on the other side of the Indochinese Peninsula. In Siam, elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death. Alexander Hamilton provides the following account from Siam:\n\nThe journal of John Crawfurd records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of Cochinchina (modern south Vietnam), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where \"the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death.\"\n\nElephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike \"under the feet of elephants\". The Hindu \"Manu Smriti\" or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, \"the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant.\" For example, in 1305, the sultan of Delhi turned the deaths of Mongol prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.\n\nDuring the Mughal era, \"it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant.\" Captain Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan ordered an offending military commander to be carried \"to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death\". The Mughal Emperor Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor Jahangir, is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The French traveler François Bernier, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of Delhi, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces \"with pointed blades fitted to their tusks\".\nThe Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta, visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:\nOther Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The Maratha Chatrapati Sambhaji ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century. Another Maratha leader, the general Santaji, inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that \"for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant.\"\n\nThe early 19th century writer Robert Kerr relates how the king of Goa \"keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are broken on the wheel.\" The naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of \"human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct\".\n\nSuch executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at Baroda in 1814 has been preserved in \"The Percy Anecdotes\":\n\nThe use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, Louis Rousselet described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a woodcut and printed in \"Le Tour du Monde\", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as \"Harper's Weekly\".\n\nThe growing power of the British Empire led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in Kashmir, since the arrival of Europeans, \"many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'.\"\n\nElephants were widely used across the Indian subcontinent and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor Robert Knox, writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in Sri Lanka. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their tusks fitted with \"sharp Iron with a socket with three edges\". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would \"then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb\".\n\nThe 19th century traveler James Emerson Tennent comments that \"a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk.\" Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, \"An Execution by an Eliphant\".\n\nWriting in 1850, the British diplomat Henry Charles Sirr described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last king of Kandy, to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:\n\nDuring the medieval period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the Byzantine, Sassanid, Seljuq and Timurid empires. When the Sassanid king Khosrau II, who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab Na'aman, Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a Zoroastrian; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.\n\nThe practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. Rabbi Petachiah of Ratisbon, a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in Seljuk-ruled northern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq):\n\nThe Romans, Carthaginians and ancient Macedonians occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of war elephants for military purposes, most famously in the case of Hannibal. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. Perdiccas, who became regent of Macedon on the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of Meleager thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of Babylon. The Roman writer Quintus Curtius Rufus relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: \"Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...\".\n\nSimilarly, the Roman writer Valerius Maximus records how the general Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus \"after King Perseus was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted.\"\n\nThere are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees in connection with the Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.\n\n"}
{"id": "215836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215836", "title": "Eye for an eye", "text": "Eye for an eye\n\n\"Only one eye for one eye\", also known as \"An eye for an eye\" or \"A tooth for a tooth\", or the law of retaliation, is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation. The intent behind the principle was to \"restrict\" compensation to the value of the loss.\n\nThe principle is sometimes referred using the Latin term lex talionis or the law of talion. The English word talion (from the Latin\" talio\") means a retaliation authorized by law, in which the punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.\n\nThe term lex talionis does not always and only refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see rather mirror punishment) but applies to the broader class of legal systems that specify formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party or the state. The most common expression of lex talionis is \"an eye for an eye\", but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of \"lex talionis\" have one thing in common: prescribed 'fitting' counter punishment for a felony. In the famous legal code written by Hammurabi, the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.\n\nThe simplest example is the \"eye for an eye\" principle. In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime. Conversely, the twelve tables of Rome merely prescribed particular penalties for particular crimes. The Anglo-Saxon legal code substituted payment of wergild for direct retribution: a particular person's life had a fixed value, derived from his social position; any homicide was compensated by paying the appropriate wergild, regardless of intent. Under the British Common Law, successful plaintiffs were entitled to repayment equal to their loss (in monetary terms). In the modern tort law system, this has been extended to translate non-economic losses into money as well. The meaning of the principle Eye for an Eye is that a person who has been injured by another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation, or that an authority does so on behalf of the injured person. The exact Latin (lex talionis) to English translation of this phrase is \"The law of retaliation.\" The root principle of this law is to provide equitable retribution.\n\nVarious ideas regarding the origins of \"lex talionis\" exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, feuds and vendettas, threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, \"lex talionis\" systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms.\n\nThe principle is found in Babylonian Law. If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take vengeful retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society. As with blasphemy or lèse-majesté (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one's social betters were punished more severely.\n\nRoman law moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance. In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although \"talio\" was still permitted if one person broke another's limb.\n\nThe principle was first referenced in the Code of Hammurabi, which predates the Hebrew bible. In the Hebrew Law, the \"eye for eye\" was to \"restrict\" compensation to the value of the loss. Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'. The idiomatic biblical phrase \"an eye for an eye\" in Exodus and Leviticus (, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally \"eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth\") is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses. The passage in Leviticus states, \"And a man who injures his countrymanas he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him.\" (Lev. 24:19–21). For an example of being used in its regular sense of \"under\", see Lev. 22:27 \"A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day...\"\n\nIsaac Kalimi explains that the \"lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted \"an eye for an eye\" to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian 'lex talionis', ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the \"peshat\" (literal meaning) of the written Torah. Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to \"adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas.\"\n\nThe Talmud interprets the verses referring to \"an eye for an eye\" and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in tort cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.\nHowever, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase \"ayin tachat ayin\" makes another appearance. Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to \"do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother\". Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.\n\nSince there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot. There is one case where the Torah states \"…and you shall cut off her hand…\" The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner. This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury. Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.\n\nThe Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (\"middah k'neged middah\") in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society (\"…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst\") and to deter potential criminals from violating the law (\"And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst\"). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).\n\nThe ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.\n\nIn Exodus 21, as in the Code of Hammurabi, the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe\" is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.\n\nHowever the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the \"eye for eye\" principle is directly followed by the proclamation \"You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen.\" This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan, \"to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them.\"\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus urges his followers to turn the other cheek:\nSome interpret this as an admonition not to seek legal steps for any compensation that corresponds in kind and degree to the injury. Others interpret it as Jesus simply teaching his followers not to take personal vengeance, rather than commenting on any legal practice.\n\nChristian interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the Church father Augustine of Hippo. He already discussed in his \"Contra Faustum\", Book XIX, the points of 'fulfilment or destruction' of the Jewish law. George Robinson characterizes the passage of Exodus (\"an eye for an eye\") as one of the \"most controversial in the Bible\". According to Robinson, some have pointed to this passage as evidence of the vengeful nature of justice in the Hebrew Bible. Similarly, Abraham Bloch speculates that the \"lex talionis has been singled out as a classical example of biblical harshness.\" Harry S. Lewis points to Lamech, Gideon and Samson as Biblical heroes who were renowned for \"their prowess in executing blood revenge upon their public and private enemies.\" Lewis asserts that this \"right of 'wild' justice was gradually limited.\" Stephen Wylen asserts that the lex talionis is \"proof of the unique value of each individual\" and that it teaches \"equality of all human beings for law.\"\n\nThe Qur'an mentions the \"eye for an eye\" concept as being ordained for the Children of Israel. The principle of Lex talionis in Islam is Qiṣāṣ (Arabic: قصاص) as mentioned in : \"O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (\"Qisas\") for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.\" Muslim countries that use Islamic \"Sharia\" law, such as Iran or Saudi Arabia, apply the \"eye for an eye\" rule literally.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a branch of applied linguistics.\n\nThere are principally three areas of application for linguists working in forensic contexts:\n\nThe discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogenous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field.\n\nThe phrase \"forensic linguistics\" first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a professor of linguistics, used it in an analysis of statements by Timothy John Evans. It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at Notting Hill police station in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial. Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up – this meaning the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements. Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of Miranda Rights and pushed focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant – leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations.\n\nDuring the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out.\n\nForensic linguistics can be traced back as early as a 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reported in \"Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note\" \"Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling.\" Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their Miranda rights during the interrogation process. An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant McDonald's claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as McWords) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'.\n\nIn the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues. They discovered that a phrase such as \"the same language\" is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview.\n\nThe 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline. Not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017, it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard and Johnson (2007), Gibbons (2003) and Olsson (2008).\n\nThe range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:\n\nThe study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context. This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area is that of the transformative effect of Norman French and Ecclesiastic Latin on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it. It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making legal language more comprehensible to laypeople.\n\nA forensic linguistics understanding of the relationship between language and law has been voiced by Leisser who states that \n\nAmong other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews.\n\nPolice officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase \"requests\" as \"commands\", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. & Tiersma, P, 2005).\n\nA defendant using ambiguity in the courtroom may present issues and be deemed unacceptable. Specifically, when a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. Refer to the following link to explore an example through the \"Louisiana vs. Demesme\" case.\n\nDuring the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. Specifically, the language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).\n\nLawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).\n\nThe lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).\n\nIn an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Intonational emphasis, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analysing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses.\n\nUrgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter.\n\nThreat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the Lindbergh kidnapping, where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: \"We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care\" (\"sic\"). From the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands but to make such a claim, the note would have to be written before the perpetrator enters the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note.\n\nKidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as \"your child is being held in a private location\" being written ahead of time.\n\nA suicide note is typically brief, concise and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness. A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees) and relevant to the relationship between them. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken. The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length. Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.\n\nDeath row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness; or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence or seek an element of revenge in their last moments (Olsson 2004). Death row statements are within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons.\nThe Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them.\n\nSocial media statements are often context specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts has been done in relation to Facebook. Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).\n\nThese areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in:\n\nSpecialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called corpora) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records and witness statements. They are used to analyse language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates).\n\nThe identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their idiolect, or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. William Labov has stated that nobody has found a \"homogenous data\" in idiolects, and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence.\n\nFirstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired. Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual's use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use. Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.\n\nThe paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects.\n\nAuthorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, article frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries) and the measurements of hapax legomena (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include factor analysis, Bayesian statistics, Poisson distribution, multivariate analysis, and discriminant function analysis of function words.\n\nThe Cusum (Cumulative Sum) method for text analysis has also been developed. Cusum analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two to three letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel-initial words.\n\nIn order to carry out the Cusum test on habits of utilizing two to three letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The Cusum distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text.\n\nThis discipline subjects written or spoken materials (or both), to scientific analysis for determination and measurement of content, meaning, speaker identification, or determination of authorship, in identifying plagiarism.\n\nOne of the earliest cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect plagiarism was the case of Helen Keller's short story \"The Frost King\", in which the blind American author was accused of plagiarism in 1892. An investigation revealed that The Frost King had been plagiarised from Margaret Canby's \"Frost Fairies\" which had been read to Keller some time earlier. It was found that Keller had made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas. Keller used 'vast wealth' instead of 'treasure' (approximately 230 times less common in the language) 'bethought' instead of 'concluded' (approximately 450 times less common), 'bade them' instead of 'told them' (approximately 30 times less common). Keller used the phrase 'ever since that time' whilst Canby chose 'from that time' (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used ' I cannot imagine' whereas Canby used ' I do not know'. 'Know' is approximately ten times more common than 'imagine'. Keller relied on a lexis that is less common when compared to Canby's. The Flesch and Flesch-Kincaid readability test showed that Canby's text showing more originality compared to Keller's. Canby's text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller's. The distinctions between Keller and Canby's text are at the lexical and phrasal level.\n\nOther examples of plagiarism include the cases between Richard Condon, author of The Manchurian Candidate and English novelist Robert Graves and between Martin Luther King Jr and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in \"The Manchurian Candidate\", Condon's work is seen to be rich in clichés such as \"in his superstitious heart of hearts.\" While Helen Keller took pride in using rare phrases and avoids common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves' work. However, in the plagiarism case between Martin Luther King Jr and Archibald Carey, almost half of King's doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more alliteration and assonance. Carey's and Graves' texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier and simpler in structure while Condon's and King's texts relied on 'purple' devices, extending the existing text and flourish their language significantly.\n\nAnother famous example is the case of Theodore Kaczynski, who was eventually convicted of being the \"Unabomber\", family members recognized his writing style from the published 35,000-word \"\" (commonly called the \"Unabomber Manifesto\"), and notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski's hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents. Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with each other.\n\nDiscourse analysis deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant semiotic event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. The use of 'I' instead of 'We' in a recording highlights non-complicity in a conspiracy. The utterance of 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' as responses indicate that the suspect understands the suggestion, while feedback markers such as 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' do not denote the suspect's agreement to the suggestion. Discourse analysts are not always allowed to testify but during preparation for a case they are often useful to lawyers.\n\nThis refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual's origin by means of his/her language or dialect.\n\nDialectology was used during the investigations into the Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax.\n\nThe forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker's social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings. Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e., alleged criminal.\n\nA man accused of manufacturing the drug ecstasy was mis-heard by the police transcriber as 'hallucinogenic' The police transcriber heard \"but if it's as you say it's hallucinogenic, it's in the Sigma catalogue.\" However, the actual utterance was \"but if it's as you say it's German, it's in the Sigma catalogue.\"\n\nAnother disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as 'Ernie'. The poor signal of the recording made 'Ernie' sound like 'Ronnie'. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding cackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name.\n\nForensic speechreading is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record.\n\nEvidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty. Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime, and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of hate mail; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist's diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect's police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of Derek Bentley the identification of Subcomandante Marcos, the Zapatistas' charismatic leader by Max Appedole and the identification of Theodore Kaczynski as the so-called \"Unabomber\" by James R. Fitzgerald.\n\nThe criminal laboratories \"Bundeskriminalamt\" (in Germany) and the \"Nederlands Forensisch Instituut\" (in the Netherlands) both employ forensic linguists.\n\nForensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of Derek Bentley's conviction for murder in 1998 although there were other non-linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was functionally illiterate, had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken monologue. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word \"then\" in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley's posthumous pardon.\nDuring the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the Mexican government speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos' identity. They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued and arrests were made in a military action. The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On February 9, 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President Ernesto Zedillo announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born June 19, 1957, in Tampico, Tamaulipas to Spanish immigrants, an Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana School of Sciences and Arts for the Design former Professor. And after the government revealed Marcos' identity in January 1995, when Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the Jesuits at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a Military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guillén, was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos' linguistic fingerprint based on Marcos' specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the Jesuits in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an idiolect, encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements this new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics called Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.\n\nForensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in Yorkshire. After she was reported missing, her partner received several text messages from Julie's mobile phone, such as \"Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out\", and \"Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things\". Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages. Simmerson was eventually found guilty of Turner's murder. \n\n19-year old Jenny Nicholl disappeared on 30 June 2005. Her body was never found, giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different than her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David's texting style and the messages sent from Jenny's phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny's murderer, David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics.\nForensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of 'jooking' in connection with a stabbing.\n\nDuring the appeal against the conviction of the Bridgewater Four, the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants – a confession which he had retracted immediately – and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence.\n\nIn an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a \"farewell letter\" had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analysed included sentence breaks, marked themes, and deletion of prepositions.\n\nIn 2015, there was a horrible house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead was a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phone of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother's phone the whole day – long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife's phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband's texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased, was actually the husband texting off her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of murder and get justice for the family.\n\nA linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique; similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint. It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone). In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion.\n\nIntra-author variations are the ways in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.\n\nThe two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily. Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "36359577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36359577", "title": "Glik v. Cunniffe", "text": "Glik v. Cunniffe\n\nGlik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public officials in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the officers violated Glik's constitutional rights and that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. The Court ruled that the right to film public officials in public places was \"clearly established,\" and that Glik's actions did not violate state law. However, the court also ruled that the right to film public officials was subject to reasonable limitations with respect to the time, place and manner in which the recording was conducted. After losing the appeal, Boston reached a settlement with Glik in which they agreed to pay him $170,000 in damages and attorney's fees. This was the first case in which a United States Circuit Court of Appeals explicitly ruled that private citizens have a right to film police officers in public spaces. The case drew media attention across the United States, and was also cited favorably by other United States Circuit Courts of Appeals that reached similar conclusions in other cases.\n\nOn October 1, 2007 while walking in Boston Common, Simon Glik observed an arrest by Boston police officers John Cunniffe, Peter Savalis, and Jerome Hall-Brewster. Glik began recording the arrest after he heard a bystander say \"[y]ou are hurting him, stop\". Because Glik was concerned that the officers were using excessive force, he filmed the encounter with his cell phone. Although Glik was 10 feet away and was not interfering with the arrest, one of the officers turned to him after placing handcuffs on the suspect and said \"I think you have taken enough pictures\". Glik replied that he was recording the incident; he said, \"I am recording this. I saw you punch him\". When the officer determined that this included audio, he placed Glik under arrest for violating the Massachusetts wiretapping law.\n\n<br>\nGlik was charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. He was taken to the South Boston police station and his cell phone and a computer flash drive were held as evidence. The Commonwealth dropped the charge of aiding in escape prior to trial. The Boston Municipal Court dismissed the other two counts in February 2008, noting that there was no probable cause for the wiretapping arrest and that the officers were unhappy about being recorded.\n\nGlik then filed a complaint with the Internal Affairs section of the Boston Police Department. After the department refused to investigate that legitimate complaint, Glik, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, along with attorneys David Milton and Howard Friedman, filed a civil rights lawsuit against the officers and the city, alleging violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The officers moved for dismissal, based in part on qualified immunity. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied the motion, noting that \"this First Amendment right publicly to record the activities of police officers on public business is established.\"\n\nThe officers then made an interlocutory appeal of the denial to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n<br>\nIn a unanimous decision written by Judge Kermit Lipez, the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that the officers violated Glik's constitutional rights. The court noted the principle of qualified immunity balanced the need to hold public officials accountable with the need to shield such officials from harassment on account of their public duties. The court therefore applied a two-part test: first, did the facts alleged by the plaintiff show a violation of a constitutional right, and second, was the right clearly established at the time of the violation.\n\nThe court first addressed the question of whether Glik's First Amendment rights had been violated. It noted that \"we have previously recognized that the videotaping of public officials is an exercise of First Amendment liberties\" and held that Glik had a constitutional right to videotape a public official in a public place. The court noted that this was not limited to reporters and journalists, but a right of all citizens, subject to reasonable limitations of time, place and manner. The First Circuit concluded that in the current case, none of those limitations applied.\n\nSecond, the court looked at whether the right to videotape was clearly established at the time of the arrest. The court had \"no trouble concluding that 'the state of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant<nowiki>[s] fair warning that [their]</nowiki> particular conduct was unconstitutional.'\" The court noted that some constitution violations are \"self-evident\" and the right to film public officials in a public place was clearly established a decade prior to Glik's arrest.\n\nNext, the court determined if Glik's Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. The court noted that an arrest must be based upon probable cause. Glik argued that the officers lacked probable cause when they made the arrest, while the officers argued that the allegations in the complaint established that they had probable cause to arrest Glik for violating the wiretap statute. The court looked to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for the determination of state law. The Massachusetts court required that the recording be made secretly to be a violation, and that when a camera was in plain sight, a recording from that camera cannot be considered \"secret\" under state law. In Glik's case, the criminal complaint stated that he had \"openly record[ed] the police officers\", the recording was not made in secret, and that therefore the officers had no probable cause to arrest Glik. Since there was no probable cause, Glik's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.\n\nFinally, the court determined that the absence of probable cause as a constitutional violation was clearly established in law. The court therefore held that the district court's denial of the officers of qualified immunity was proper, affirming the decision.\n\nDespite his victory in court, the case had negative repercussions for Glik, an attorney, who had difficulty obtaining employment as a prosecutor while criminal charges were pending against him. He is now a criminal defense lawyer. After losing the appeal, Boston settled the lawsuit for $170,000, paying Glik for damages and legal fees. Additionally, the city reversed its earlier opinion that the officers had done nothing wrong, stating that the officers had shown \"unreasonable judgement\" by arresting Glik. In 2012, a Boston Police Department spokesperson stated that the officers involved in the case stood to face \"discipline ranging from an oral reprimand to suspension\". The Boston Police Department now trains its officers not to arrest people for openly recording them in public.\n\nSome scholars have identified \"Glik\" as the first case in which a United States Circuit Court of Appeals explicitly held that a citizen had the same rights as a journalist to record public officials in a public place, while other scholars have identified earlier rulings by circuit courts that have upheld a right of \"publicly gathering information\" while filming the police. Nevertheless, scholars generally consider \"Glik\" to be the first case to \"tackle the issue of police recording in the smartphone era\". Following the First Circuit's ruling, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction prohibiting the State of Illinois from enforcing its wiretapping law against citizens openly recording public officials in public places. Citing \"Glik\", the Seventh Circuit stated that \"applying the statute in the circumstances alleged here is likely unconstitutional.\"\n\nIn addition to the First and the Seventh Circuits, both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals have held that the public has a First Amendment right to record public officials. In 2000, in \"Smith v. City of Cumming\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the First Amendment protects the right of citizens to film the police. Likewise, in 1995, in \"Fordyce v. City of Seattle\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a private citizen could film police conduct at a protest because the First Amendment protects the \"right to film matters of public interest\". However, both the Third Circuit in \"Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle\" (2010) and the Fourth Circuit in \"Szymecki v. Houck\" (2009) have held that even if the constitution protects the right to film the police, such a right was \"not clearly established for the purposes of qualified immunity in those cases’ factual contexts\". Additionally, the Fifth Circuit ruled in \"Turner v. Driver\" (2017) that while the officers were entitled to qualified immunity in that case, the First Amendment protects the right to record police, subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. Some scholars suggest these various rulings present the potential for a circuit split in cases that involve the filming of police conduct, while others have described the different rulings among circuit courts as \" an artificial split—not on the merits of the First Amendment right violated, but on technical qualified immunity ground\".\n\nIn February 2016, Judge Mark A. Kearney of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled in \"Fields v. City of Philadelphia\" that \"observing and recording\" police is not expressive conduct under the First Amendment and is therefore not protected by the constitution. Commentators have noted that this opinion \"breaks with consensus among federal courts\", and that the case marked \"the first time a federal court has \"not\" found that recording cops while on duty and in a public setting is protected by the First Amendment\". Eugene Volokh also stated that the case is inconsistent with precedent from other federal circuit courts. Following the publication of the court's opinion, the American Civil Liberties Union announced that it would appeal the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n\nThe case drew national media attention, prompting editorials from the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"The New York Times\", amongst others. The case has also drawn notice in the legal community, with articles in the American Bar Association Journal and the Volokh Conspiracy. In addition, the United States Department of Justice cited the Glik case extensively in a letter to the Baltimore Police Department expressing concerns over policies dealing with officer interactions with citizen photographers and videographers. Commentary from law journals also discussed the lasting impact of the case. In an article for the \"Case Western Reserve Law Review\", Gregory T. Frohman wrote that the court's ruling \"seemingly laid down a nearly unfettered right for nonthreatening third-party recorders in public places\". In an article for the \"Northern Illinois University Law Review\", Jesse Harlan Alderman wrote that \"[t]hough \"Glik\" and \"Alvarez\" hold sway only within their respective jurisdictions, it seems likely that the right to record public police activity will be treated as universal\". Matt Giffin, writing for the \"Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review\", observed that the case \"could play a significant role in solidifying the emerging consensus that citizens have a constitutional interest in monitoring the activities of police officers\". Likewise, in an article for the \"Cardozo Law Review\", Travis S. Triano noted that the Court's ruling emphasized that \"Glik’s filming was found to fall well within the bounds of constitutional protections\".\n\nHowever, other analysts have questioned whether the First Circuit's ruling would, in fact, have a widespread impact in the future. For example, an article in the \"Harvard Law Review\" noted that the First Circuit's ruling in \"Glik\" was evidence of the court's willingness to protect a \"vital First Amendment right\", but that \"the proliferation of body cameras may make civilians feel as if they no longer need to record officers in the field\". Writing for the \"Florida Law Review\", Caycee Hampton criticized the First Circuit for providing \"no guidance for determining what situations constitute a 'public space' in which a citizen’s right to film government officials is safeguarded by the First Amendment\", and absent such guidance, \"citizens who choose to record law enforcement officials risk inviting the same Fourth Amendment violation confirmed in \"Glik\"\". Additionally, in an article in the \"St. Louis University Law Journal\", Justin Welply argued that the right to film the police is not absolute, and that \"an individual has a First Amendment right to openly record police conduct in a public park, but does not have an established First Amendment right to openly record officers in the discharge of their duties during a traffic stop\" because filming the police during a traffic stop may interfere with their ability to work effectively.\n\n"}
{"id": "34517249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34517249", "title": "Information policy", "text": "Information policy\n\nInformation policy is the set of all public laws, regulations and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of information. It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.\n\nThere are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are public policy issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as intellectual property, economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, information security, access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.\n\nInformation policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired. It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.” The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.\n\nAlthough information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction. On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”\n\nInformation policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including information science, economics, law, and public policy. Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.\n\nThe earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s. The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations. The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies. Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.\n\nBy the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.\n\nElizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the United Kingdom Ministry of Information was established in the First World War to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.\n\nIn the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal Privacy Act provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.\n\nThe types of information policy can be separated into two different categories. It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science. It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.\n\nThe obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology. More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or P2P technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks). As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation. Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act). Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.\n\n1. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss);\n\n2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management\n3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information\n\n4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments\n\nThere are some issues around organizational information policies, which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.\n\nConvergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers. It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks. Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain. As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.\n\nNearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity. Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.\n\nIn 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems. The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material. For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook. This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.\n\nThe issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by privacy laws. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.\n\nInternet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet. Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.\n\nArchitecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally. Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other. Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance. It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.\nOrganizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet. For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the Domain Name System (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.\n\nLike with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others. Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.\n\nA persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information. Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties. The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include: \nThe USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress. Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically fourth amendment rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nThe five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:\n\nClassification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.\n\nIdentification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).\n\nReductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. \nForecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is STEEP framework. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.\n\nProcess-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.\n\nIn regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows. Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field. As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well. It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.\n\nThe information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of Web 2.0 nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.\n\nIn order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).\n\nInformation policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009). The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011). As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009). The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1945845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945845", "title": "Judicial activism", "text": "Judicial activism\n\nJudicial activism refers to judicial rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of judicial restraint. The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to constitutional interpretation, statutory construction, and separation of powers.\n\nArthur Schlesinger Jr. introduced the term \"judicial activism\" in a January 1947 \"Fortune\" magazine article titled \"The Supreme Court: 1947\".\n\nThe phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, \"An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism,\" is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; \"Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad.\"\n\nEven before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, Thomas Jefferson referred to the \"despotic behaviour\" of Federalist federal judges, in particular Chief Justice John Marshall.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines judicial activism as a \"philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions.\"\n\nPolitical science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist: majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning judicial precedent, and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.\n\nOthers have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. Kermit Roosevelt III has argued that \"in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with\"; likewise, the solicitor general under George W. Bush, Theodore Olson, said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\", in regards to a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated, that \"most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like.\" Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has said that, \"An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like.\"\n\nDetractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy. Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of judicial review, and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.\n\nA third view is that so-called \"objective\" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, \"Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices.\" Under this view, any judge's use of judicial discretion will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).\n\nSome proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient majoritarianism, i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers. Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.\n\nMoreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.\n\nThe following rulings have been characterized as judicial activism.\n\n\nWhile the term was first coined and is often used in the United States, it has also been applied in other countries, particularly common law jurisdictions.\n\nIndia has a recent history of judicial activism, originating after the emergency in India which saw attempts by the Government to control the judiciary. Public Interest Litigation was thus an instrument devised by the courts to reach out directly to the public, and take cognizance though the litigant may not be the victim. \"Suo motu\" cognizance allows the courts to take up such cases on its own. The trend has been supported as well criticized. New York Times author Gardiner Harris sums this up as\nAll such rulings carry the force of Article 39A of the Constitution of India, although before and during the Emergency the judiciary desisted from \"wide and elastic\" interpretations, termed Austinian, because Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable. This despite the constitutional provisions for judicial review and B R Ambedkar arguing in the Constituent Assembly Debates that \"judicial review, particularly writ jurisdiction, could provide quick relief against abridgment of Fundamental Rights and ought to be at the heart of the Constitution.\"\n\nFundamental Rights as enshrined in the Constitution have been subjected to wide review, and have now been said to encompass a right to privacy, right to livelihood and right to education, among others. The 'basic structure' of the Constitution has been mandated by the Supreme Court not to be alterable, notwithstanding the powers of the Legislature under Article 368. This was recognized, and deemed not applicable by the High Court of Singapore in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs.\n\nRecent examples quoted include the order to Delhi Government to convert the Auto rickshaw to CNG, a move believed to have reduced Delhi's erstwhile acute smog problem (it is now argued to be back) and contrasted with Beijing's.\n\nThe Israeli approach to judicial activism has transformed significantly in the last three decades, and currently presents an especially broad version of robust judicial review and intervention. Additionally, taking into consideration the intensity of public life in Israel and the challenges that the country faces (including security threats), the case law of the Israeli Supreme Court touches on diverse and controversial public matters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2935306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2935306", "title": "Law in action", "text": "Law in action\n\nLaw in action is a legal theory, associated with legal realism, that examines the role of law, not just as it exists in the statutes and cases, but as it is actually applied in society. Law in action scholars often start with observations about the behavior of institutions and work \"backwards\" toward the legal philosophies guiding courts and traditional jurisprudence. As Kenneth B. Davis, Jr., Dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School has stated, \"'Law in Action' . . . means that in teaching and research, no matter how interesting we find a legal theory, we always need to ask, 'How does this affect people's lives in the real world?'\"\n\nThe first reference to Law in Action may have been a 1910 article by Roscoe Pound, the Harvard Law School dean whose work was a forerunner to the legal realism movement. From there, the concept caught hold at the University of Wisconsin Law School, where the law in action concept is most prevalent today. The law in action concept was a natural fit for Wisconsin because of its strong emphasis on the social sciences and the Wisconsin Idea—the concept that the boundaries of campus are the boundaries of the state.\n\nAs at law schools everywhere, the focus is on appellate opinions. However, a professor who focuses on law in action is likely to go past the holding of the case to look at more questions such as \"How might the parties on the losing end of the case respond?\" \"Will the rule change their future behavior?\" \"Who will enforce the rule?\" or \"What was the cause of the underlying dispute?\" will be addressed Similarly, clinical education and clinical skills courses take on a more important role for students, who get to integrate their personal experiences with the classroom work.\n\n\n"}

Previously, the Commission on Higher Education supervises the legal education in the Philippines but was replaced by the Legal Education Board since 1993 after the enactment of Republic Act No. 7662 or the Legal Education Reform Act of 1993.\n\nThe legal education in the Philippines was first introduced during the Spanish occupation when, in 1734, the University of Santo Tomas established the Faculty of Civil Law. After the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established by Joaquin Gonzales in 1899; the said institution offered several courses including law. However, the Literaria's existence was short lived as a result of the eruption of the Filipino-American conflict. During the American occupation, specifically in 1911, the University of the Philippines College of Law was established, through the vision and efforts of George Malcolm. The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country.\n\nThe ratification of the 1935 Constitution paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the Department of Public Instruction). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The Faculty of Civil Law of the University of Santo Tomas, the University of the Philippines–College of Law, the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the Philippine Law School were the leading law institutions during those period. After World War II and in the contemporary time, more law schools were then established.\n\nThe Legal Education Board supervises all law schools and continuing legal education providers in the Philippines. The Board is headed by a Chairman who is a retired justice of a collegiate court (i.e., Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, etc.). Regular members of the Board include a representative from each of the following:\n\n\nThe Board has made legal reforms which include—the stricter selection of law students and law professors; improvements in quality of instruction and facilities of law schools; provisions for legal apprenticeship of law students; and the requirement of attendance to continuing legal education seminars for practicing attorneys.\n\nLawyers with names appearing in the \"Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court\", unless disbarred, are all members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). However, to be IBP members of good standing, lawyers are required to complete, every three years, at least thirty-six hours of continuing legal education seminars approved by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Committee (MCLE). Members who fail to comply shall pay a non-compliance fee, and shall be listed as a delinquent member.\n\nThe Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office, established by the Supreme Court, is the official government agency tasked to implement compliance with the MCLE requirement. The MCLE Office is headed by former Supreme Court Justice Carolina C. Grino-Aquino, widow of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Ramon Aquino. Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.\n\nThe Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include the Roman civil law which was inherited from Spain; the Anglo-American common law which were derived from the laws of the United States; and Islamic law otherwise known as the Shariah law of the Muslim world, Private law and legal codes are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while the Public Law, including the Political law, is based on Anglo-American legal system.\n\nLaw degree programs are considered professional/post-baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the Philippine Bar Examination, the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country.\n\nLegal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:\n\nLaw degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types—professional, graduate level, and honorary.\n\nIn order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete one of the two professional degrees: The Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.\n\n\nBeyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law.\n\n\nSome Philippine universities also confer the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general.\n\nA few Roman Catholic seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in canon law, an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the Philippine Bar Examinations.The University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its Licentiate of Canon Law (J.C.L.) and Doctor of Canon Law (J.C.D.) programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field. Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines.\n\nThere is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula. There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from \"LL.B.\" to \"J.D.\" while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989).\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the Philippines. This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination.\n\nTo be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar. In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: \n\nThe Philippine Bar Examinations is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year. It is arguably the hardest and the most media-covered of all government licensure examinations in the country. It is also reputedly one of the hardest bar examinations in the world.\n\nFor candidates intending to practice Islamic law in the Philippines, the \"Special Bar Exams for Shari'a Court Lawyers\" is given every two years. The Supreme Court Bar Office conducts the exam while the Office of Muslim Affairs determines the qualification and eligibility of candidates to the exams.\n\nTo be a full-fledged lawyer in the Philippines and be eligible to use the title \"Attorney\", a candidate must graduate from a Philippine law school, take and pass the Philippine Bar Examinations, the candidate who passed the bar examinations is entitled to take and subscribe before the Supreme Court special en banc session the corresponding Attorney's Oath, as follows:\n\nThe certificate to practice law will be granted by the Supreme Court after the lawyer sign his name in the \"Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court\". The full names of lawyers are found in the \"Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court\", and in a similar list included in a Supreme Court publication entitled \"Law List.\"\n\nStarting from 2017, the Legal Education Board had started implementing the Philippine Law School Admission Test ; the failure to pass such admission test prohibits a person from enrolling to any law schools in the Philippines. It is a one-day aptitude test intended to measure the academic potential of an examinee who wishes to pursue the study of law.\n\n, there are 108 law schools legitimately operating throughout the Philippines. These include independent law schools, resident colleges, and affiliated units of much larger private and public universities:\n</small>\n\nThe following schools are the top performing law schools in the Philippines. Such ranking was based upon the cumulative performance from the recent results of the bar examinations from 2012 to 2014. In the list, 4 out 10 law schools are outside Metro Manila:\n"}

Instead, the client represents his or herself \"pro se\".\n\nThe growth of \"pro se\" litigants can be attributed to the high cost of litigation, anti-lawyer sentiment, and the advent of do-it-yourself law services. However, self-represented litigants may still need legal representation in order and to navigate the litigation process. \n\nLegal ghostwriting is one way in which clients can receive legal counsel while maintaining control of their case and avoiding higher legal costs. Attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services often charge a flat fee rather than billing by the hour as is typical for full-service attorneys.\n\nThe ABA formally endorsed the delivery of legal ghostwriting services by attorneys to \"pro se\" clients in 2007. In a formal opinion, the ABA deemed the practice consistent with Rule 1.2(c) of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct which allows lawyers to unbundle their services to clients. According to the ABA opinion paper, lawyers should generally disclose the fact that papers were prepared by an attorney, but need not disclose their name of firm.\n\nThe New York County Law Association agreed with the ABA approach to legal ghostwriting in a 2010 ethics opinion paper. In that decision, NYCLA found that “…it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a pro se litigant without disclosing the lawyer’s participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‘where necessary.” \n\nThe Second Circuit court in 2011 ruled that it was not improper for an attorney to ghostwrite legal pleadings on behalf of a self-represented litigant.\n\nEthical concerns may arise for attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services to clients. A common criticism of legal ghostwriting is that it gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage because judges often grant \"pro se\" litigants leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. Critics argue that when clients employ an attorney ghostwriter, they should not be entitled to that privilege. For this reason, the New York State Bar Association requires attorneys to disclose their assistance in papers submitted to the court. Attorneys are not, however, required to disclose their name or firm. \n\nOther critics are concerned that when an attorney provides legal ghostwriting services to a client without disclosing his or her name, the attorney might be misleading the court, or seeking to avoid malpractice lawsuits or court rules against frivolous lawsuits. \n\nHowever, the ABA in its 2007 opinion paper claimed that these ethical concerns were overstated. It concluded that:\n\n\"[b]ecause there is no reasonable concern that a litigant appearing \"pro se\" will receive an unfair benefit from a tribunal as a result of behind-the-scenes legal assistance, the nature or extent of such assistance is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Similarly, we do not believe that nondisclosure of the fact of legal assistance is dishonest so as to be prohibited by Rule 8.4(c). Whether it is dishonest for the lawyer to provide undisclosed assistance to a pro se litigant turns on whether the court would be misled by failure to disclose such assistance. The lawyer is making no statement at all to the forum regarding the nature or scope of the representation, and indeed, may be obliged under Rules 1.210 and 1.611 not to reveal the fact of the representation. Absent an affirmative statement by the client, that can be attributed to the lawyer, that the documents were prepared without legal assistance, the lawyer has not been dishonest within the meaning of Rule 8.4(c). For the same reason, we reject the contention that a lawyer who does not appear in the action circumvents court rules requiring the assumption of responsibility for their pleadings. Such rules apply only if a lawyer signs the pleading and thereby makes an affirmative statement to the tribunal concerning the matter. Where a pro se litigant is assisted, no such duty is assumed. We conclude that there is no prohibition in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct against undisclosed assistance to pro se litigants, as long as the lawyer does not do so in a manner that violates rules that otherwise would apply to the lawyer’s conduct.\"\n\n"}

She is famous (as Boccaccio says) \"more through the lavishness of her ancestors than through the worthiness of any of her own deeds. For at that time it seemed such a marvellous thing to give 50,000 bronze coins as dowry to one's husband...\" Boccaccio used manuscripts of Valerius Maximus as his source, but they \"disagree widely about the amount of money in Megullia's dowry\". Valerius says in his Book 4 (4.10) that Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus wrote to the Senate from Spain asking to be replaced. He wanted to go home to build up a dowry for his daughter that just became of marrying age. The Senate wanted Scipio to stay in command, so they consulted with the bride to be and Scipio's family and agreed on an amount that would be acceptable for a dowry of a daughter of a person of such high rank. They raised a dowry for Scipio's daughter from the treasury of 40,000 asses. Valerius compares this sum of a family fortune to those raised for \"Tuccia, daughter of Caeso Quinctius\" (10,000 \"asses\") and for Megullia, daughter of a consul (50,000 \"asses\") - from which the name \"Dotata\" (dowried) came when she entered her husband's house with this large amount. It was added to make then the name of the woman with such a large dowry that of Megullia Dotata. Besides Scipio and Fabricius, the Senate raised dowries for the daughters of others they wished to keep in service if there were no family funds for a dowry, like in the case of Fabricius Luscinus.\n\nAt the beginning of the Roman republic dowries were small. For example, the dowry given by the senate to the daughter of Scipio Africanus was only 35 pounds or 11,000 \"asses of brass.\" If the dowry was about five times this amount, 160 - 175 pounds (50,000 \"asses of brass\"), then it was considered a Great Fortune and \"Megullia\" was nicknamed \"Dotata\". The name \"dotata\" was synonymous with \"dowry girl\" and was the name given to the bride that had a dowry. This trend continued for a long time and if anything above a normal amount was given then the female giver was called a \"Megullia Dotata\".\n\nParaphernalia\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33606303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33606303", "title": "Otium", "text": "Otium\n\nOtium, a Latin abstract term, has a variety of meanings, including leisure time in which a person can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's retirement after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing \"active public life\". \"Otium\" can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (\"negotium\") or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (\"i.e.\" speaking, writing, philosophy). It had particular meaning to businessmen, diplomats, philosophers and poets.\n\nIn ancient Roman culture \"otium\" was a military concept as its first Latin usage. This was in Ennius' \"Iphigenia.\"\n\n\"Iphigenia\" (241–248)\nAccording to historian Carl Deroux in his work \"Studies in Latin literature and Roman history\", the word \"otium\" appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia. Ennius' first use of the term \"otium\" around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed \"otium negotiosum\" (free time to do what one wanted) and \"otium otiosum\" (idle wasteless free time). Aulus Gellius, while discussing the word \"praeterpropter\" (\"more or less\") quotes a fragment of Ennius's \"Iphigenia\", which contrasts \"otium\" with \"negotium\" repeatedly. Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as \"more or less\" \"living\".\n\nThe earliest extant appearance of the word in Latin literature occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the \"Iphigenia\" of Ennius, where it is contrasted to \"negotium\". Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of \"otium\" was never a direct translation of the Greek word \"schole\", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. \"Otium\" is an example of the usage of the term \"praeterpropter\", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war. In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (\"i.e.\", winter months, weather not permitting war). This was associated with \"otium otiosum\" (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was \"otium negotiosum\" (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying hobby or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was \"otium privatum\" (private leisure), equal to \"negotium\" (a type of business).\n\nThe oldest citation for \"otium\" is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius. Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (\"otium\") than to be idle doing nothing. Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons - a time for peace. Even though originally \"otium\" was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons, it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself. The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of \"otium\" as a waste of time. Historians of ancient Roman considered \"otium\" a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties. Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and Brian Vickers point out the only legitimate form of \"otium\" was transpired with intellectual activity. \"Otium\" was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (\"negotium\") and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.\n\nThe favorable sense of \"otium\" in Ciceronian Latin reflects the Greek term (\"skholē\", \"leisure\", a meaning retained in Modern Greek as σχόλη, \"schólē\"); \"leisure\" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the Athenian gentleman: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became \"discussion\", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. Plato (and his contemporaries, if the \"Greater Hippias\" be not authentic) brought \"schole\" into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the \"Greater Hippias\", it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the \"Apology\", has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue. However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the Academy, they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the New Academy of Carneades practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.\n\nTheophrastus and Dicaearchus, students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life.\n\nRoman Epicureans used \"otium\" for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus. An Epicurean proverb \nThe phrase \"to be at ease\" can have the meaning \"to be of good cheer\" or \"to be without fear\" these being interdependent. The Epicurean idea of \"otium\" favors contemplation, compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (\"i.e.\" sailors). The rustic \"otium\" concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism. The active city public life of \"negotium\" and an \"otium\" of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by Cicero and Seneca the Younger.\n\nEpicurus's philosophy was contrary to Hellenistic Stoicism. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of \"otium\". The concept of the Epicurean \"otium\" (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first–century historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in \"The Garden\" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean \"otium\" and the Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of \"otium\" (\"i.e.\" private or public; contemplation or \"employment\"; \"otium\" or \"negotium\").\n\nIn early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, \"otium\" is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to \"officium\", \"office, duty\" than to \"negotium\" ('business\"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then \"otium\" meant \"leisure\" while \"negotium\" meant \"non-leisure\" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of \"otium\" was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. \"Otium \" and \"negotium\" was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.\n\nHistorian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of \"otium\" was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter, as opposed to the business (\"negotium\") of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual \"otium.\" Andre shows that the beauty of the individual \"otium\" poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play \"Mercator\" says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim \"tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames\" (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).\n\nCicero speaks of himself, with the expression \"otium cum dignitate\", that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life. When he was ousted from each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for \"worthy leisure\". During this time he composed \"Tusculanae Disputationes\", a series of books on Stoic philosophy. Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing. Cicero defines \"otium\" as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) - a type of \"public health\". It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book \"On Duties\" that when the city life becomes too much, one should retreat to the country for leisure. The term \"otium cum dignitate\" in Cicero's \"Pro Sestio\" was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some. Cicero says in \"Pro Sestio\", XLV., 98\nCicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and \"otium\". In one passage of \"De Oratore\" he explains that Philistus spent his retirement writing history as his \"otium\". He goes on to say in \"De Oratore\" Book iii that other men passed their \"otium\" of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, knucklebones, dice games or just games they made up. Others that were \"retired\" from public life for whatever reason devoted their \"otium cum seritio\" (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.\n\nGerman historian Klaus Bringmann shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a hypocrite while in \"otium\" because of his sense of duty to serve the state. Cicero's concept of \"otium\" does not mean selfish pursuit of pleasure. It means the well-earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (\"desidia\") had derogatory implications and unqualified \"otium\" was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with \"negotia publica\", participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy. To distinguish between plain \"idleness\" and aristocratic \"otium homestum\", \"otium liberale\" or \"otium cum dignitate\", writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to \"res publica\" (the general public). These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.\n\nCicero praises Cato the Elder for his respectful use of \"otium\" in his expression \"non minus otii quam negotii\" (no less for doing nothing than business). Cicero was associating \"otium\" with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that Scipio Africanus claimed he was \"never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.\" Cicero in his \"De Officiis\" (book III 1-4) further says of Scipio Africanus \"Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a goad.\" Cicero's idea of \"otium cum dignitate\" (leisure with dignity) is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of \"free time\" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (\"otium\") available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of hobbies. Cicero has a number of different concept versions for \"otium\". In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (\"maximos labores\") should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.\n\nCatullus, a late Roman Republic poet, in his poems shows that the significance of \"otium\" of the middle Republican time of autonomy into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark \"otium\" with erotic influence.\n\nThe imperial dictatorship by Augustus during the fall of the Roman Republic put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (\"otium\") because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).\n\nThe home of choice (\"domus\") then became the countryside villa as the rise of the Roman Empire made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners. Greek-style architecture became their new villa otium outside of town. In ancient Roman times the \"otium villa \" was a Dionysian idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (\"otium\") in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (\"negotium\"). The \"villa with a garden\" and \"villa by the sea\" was associated with \"otium\".\nThe life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a \"superior world\" of living.\n\nThe Imperial Roman poet Statius writes of a \"otium villa\" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work \"Silvae\": \"It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure, non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...\" Pliny the Younger exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in \"otium\" of the time by the life he lived from his \"otium villas\". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bath, take naps and occasionally hunt.\n\nTibullus was an Augustan elegiac poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his existing first two books of poetry he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer. Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, \"adsiduus labor\", and military service (\"militia\"). He shows in his poetry that originally \"otium\" was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons. Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (\"interdum\") and therefore inserts \"otium\" (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life. He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of \"ignobile otium\" (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.\n\nSeneca compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of \"otium\". He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views Stoicism and Epicureanism as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward \"otium\". The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that \"otium\" is not really \"free time\", but a study of other matters (\"i.e.\", reading, writing) other than political and career gains.\n\nThe increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by \"otium liberale\" (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of \"otium ruris\" (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life. Seneca's doctrine of \"De Otio\" describes retirement from public life. The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on \"otium\" (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to \"negotium\".\n\nThese are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of \"De Otio\":\n\nWhile Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of Athenodorus's \"De Tranquillitate\" it is basically different. In \"De Otio 3.5\" Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in \"De Tranquillitate\" the theme is peace of mind.\n\nSaint Augustine of Hippo reminded Romans of \"otium philosophandi\", a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that \"otium\" was the prerequisite for contemplation. It was because of \"otium\" that Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described \"Christianae vita otium\" as the Christian life of leisure. Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of \"otium\" as the deadly sin of acedia (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated \"otium\" as meaning to serve God through deep thought. Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify \"otium\". These same Christian writers also showed \"otium ruris\" (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic \"propositum\". Augustine describes the monastic life as \"otium sanctum\" (sanctified leisure or approved leisure). In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - \"negotium\") and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - \"otium\").\n\nPetrarch, 14th-century poet and Renaissance humanist, discusses \"otium\" in his \"De vita solitaria\" as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees \"otium\" not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship.\n\nPetrarch considered solitude (\"i.e.\", rural setting, \"villa otium\", his Vaucluse home) and its relationship to \"otium\" as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca. He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said \"no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it.\"\n\nHistorian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of \"otium\":\nPetrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in \"otium\" (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's \"Vetus Itala\" in \"De otio religioso\" where in Christianity it was associated with contemplation and \"vacatio\" (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with \"videre\" (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of \"otium\" as \"vacate et videte\" (be still and see—a form of meditation, contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.\n\nAndrew Marvell’s seventeenth-century poem The Garden is a lyric of nine stanzas in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to \"otium\". The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows \"otium\" to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized \"otium\" with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.\n\nPart of Marvell's poem The Garden below:\n\nBrian Vickers, a 20th-century British literary scholar, points out an expression made by Friedrich Nietzsche, a 19th-century German philosopher, on scholars' opinion of \"otium\" in his 1878 publication \"Menschliches, Allzumenschliches\":\n\nPrivate life meaning of \"otium\" meant personal retirement—the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of \"active public life\". One would not be a historian in this case.\n\nIn public life \"otium\" meant public peace and relief after war. It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war). This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the \"status quo\": acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.\n\n\n\"Otium\" carried with it many different meanings (including but not limited to time, chance, opportunity), depending on the time period or the philosophers involved in determining the concept.\n\nSynonyms of positive connotations are:\n\nSynonyms of negative connotations are:\n\nFor a comparatively recent and exhaustive authoritative study on \"otium\"' in the history of Roman culture see \n\nGregory M. Sadlek gives even a more recent and exhaustive study on \"otium\"' in his 2004 book \" Idleness working: the discourse of love's labor from Ovid through Chaucer and Gower\", .\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16438268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16438268", "title": "Patient and mortuary neglect", "text": "Patient and mortuary neglect\n\nNeglect is defined as giving little attention to or to leave undone or unattended to, especially through carelessness. Mortuary neglect can comprise many things, such as bodies being stolen from the morgue, or bodies being mixed up and the wrong one was buried. When a mortuary fails to preserve a body correctly, it could also be considered neglect because of the consequences.\n\nPatient neglect is similar to mortuary neglect with one major difference: that patient neglect has to do with people who are still living and that neglect could ultimately lead to their death. Patient neglect concerns people in hospitals, in nursing homes, or being cared for in home. Usually in nursing homes or home-assisted living, neglect would consist of patients being left lying in their own urine and/or feces, which could, in turn, possibly attract flesh flies and lead to maggot infestation. It also encompasses patients getting rashes, lice, and other sores from being improperly cared for.\n\nThe general sign of mortuary neglect (in terms of forensic entomology) is an infestation of maggots or some other insect (such as cockroaches) of a corpse. This should not be confused with insects found on a body before they are transferred to the morgue. The following examples are forms of mortuary neglect that pertain to the ethical treatment of a corpse.\n\nImproper embalming is the utilization of embalming techniques that cause premature decomposition of the body especially in cases where the body in question is to be presented in an open-casket funeral. In addition, not refrigerating the body immediately following death, but before the embalming process could lead to rapid deterioration of the human remains as well.\n\nOn August 29, 1994, widow Marian Washington filed suit against funeral home, John T. Rhines Co., for improperly embalming her late husband Vernon W. Washington. She claimed that the embalming fluid was leaking and that her husband’s skin was decomposing at an alarming rate. John T. Rhines Co. re-embalmed Mr. Washington in efforts to make his body presentable. However, they failed to restore Mr. Washington’s body completely.\n\nOn May 3, 1956, Cooley, a petitioner of a particular funeral home tried to appeal the revoke of his license by the California state board of funeral directors and embalmers. The case reveals the reasons as to why the license was revoked. Cooley’s practices were described as unsanitary for the following reasons: an infant was discovered improperly embalmed after maggots were seeping out of its orifices, commingling of bodies, blood stains were found on the walls, and tools used were not cleaned from one autopsy to the next. Needless to say, the appeal was not granted.\n\nThis form of abuse consists of selling body parts stolen from carcasses that are sent to the morgue for embalming.\n\nCommingling of ashes is putting several carcasses in the same crematorium during the same burn cycle. This act undermines the respect due a passed loved one.\n\nIn this form of abuse, funeral home operators dispose of the body in a manner not authorized by the deceased’s loved ones.\n\nOn June 28, 1990, a court heard a case on a class action suit against multiple funeral service operators. These acts included all of the types of mortuary neglect mentioned above in this section. The case contended that the defendants violated conscionable standards regarding the treatment of the deceased. This practice occurred for nearly a decade and victimized approximately 17,000 decedents and their families.\n\nAny violation of the standards that any reasonable person would expect of a Mortuary operator could be considered in this category.\n\nJames Dennis, widower of Molly Dennis, sued Robbins Funeral Home on August 24, 1987. Before Mrs. Dennis was to be cremated, Lee Miller, the funeral director of Robbins Funeral Home called the family to see the body. When the family arrived, to their dismay, they found Molly Dennis’s body unprofessionally presented in an unhygienic environment as unspecified limbs were hanging off the dissection table and into a dirty sink. Mr. Dennis was not, however, able to successfully sue the funeral home because the judicial history in the area did not include a precedent for funeral home malpractice.\n\nThe National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) is an organization in the United States that regulates mortuaries and morgues and their activities regarding the embalming and interring of the deceased. With any complaint including mortuary neglect, the NFDA has a fifteen step disciplinary process it goes through to determine the severity of the situation. After receiving a complaint, a committee reviews the situation even to the extent of an investigation and then they determine the consequences of the violation. Those considered in violation of the NFDA’s policies could face punitive action ranging from a warning to suspension from the organization.\n\nThere are certain segments of the health care industry that are seeing downward moves in neglect, while other sections are experiencing unfortunate growth. In modern hospitals the most prevalent form of neglect deals with the patients themselves neglecting their own care. However, in other segments such as assisted living for mentally deficient patients the rates of abuse and neglect are still relatively high.\n\nMortuary neglect is another segment that has peculiar trends. There are relatively few morticians that just refuse to perform their duties. However, cases of ethically questionable practices can be easily found. Morticians only preserving visible body parts, incomplete embalming and defrauding families are just a few examples of reported cases of neglect.\n\nIncreasingly medical journals are recommending that doctors become more active in attempting to persuade parents and guardians of children to either accept or continue treatment for diseases or injuries in order to avoid a neglect case. In the American Orthopedic Journal a case study was presented where a doctor suggested that an effort to convince a girl's mother to adequately treat a case of ambylopia to avoid potential neglect. While a viewpoint arguing this was unnecessary, it shows a growing trend to go beyond traditional measures to avoid neglect charges.\n\nFrom the times of the ancient Egyptians, cases of mortuary neglect have been recorded. The process of embalming is to preserve the dead for burial, as the Egyptians believed the afterlife was just as important as life itself. However, if a woman was married to an embalmer, he would likely keep her preserved for his own benefit until obvious decomposition took place.\n\nDignity for the dead is now a legal matter, as patient neglect has always been. Abuse in the healthcare system is another huge problem in today’s society. Nursing homes and hospitals are preying grounds for predators of the weak and disabled. In 2001 a nursing home in Ossining, New York was closed because of neglect and unsafe conditions that existed for the patients.\n\nFor the most part, mortuary standards are created by the states, not by the federal government. The following are links to state policies (where available) on mortuary practices:\n"}

{"id": "299378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299378", "title": "Political sociology", "text": "Political sociology\n\nPolitical sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State, to civil society, to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the \"founding fathers\" of sociology – Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber – to such contemporary theorists as Gellner, Giddens, Habermas and Mann. \nWhere a typical research question in political sociology might have been \"Why do so few American or European citizens choose to vote?\" or even \"What difference does it make if women get elected?\", political sociologists also now ask: \"How is the body a site of power?\", \"How are emotions relevant to global poverty?\", or \"What difference does knowledge make to democracy?\"\n\nTraditionally there were four main areas of research:\n\n\nIn other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis (which overlaps with Marxist analysis). Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the \"power structure\" or \"instrumentalist\" approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others (Nicos Poulantzas, Bob Jessop).\n\nContemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of social theory. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies (Stuart Hall), post-structuralism (Michel Foucault, Judith Butler), pragmatism (Luc Boltanski), structuration theory (Anthony Giddens), and cultural sociology (Jeffrey C. Alexander).\n\nPolitical sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal economic power and thus possible political inequality as well.\n\nFor pluralists, the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.\n\nThe pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and Baratz (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.\n\n"}

{"id": "153149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153149", "title": "Regulation", "text": "Regulation\n\nRegulation is an abstract concept of management of complex systems according to a set of rules and trends. In systems theory, these types of rules exist in various fields of biology and society, but the term has slightly different meanings according to context. For example:\n\nRegulation in the social, political, and economic domains can take many forms: legal restrictions promulgated by a government authority, contractual obligations (for example, contracts between insurers and their insureds), social regulation (e.g. norms), co-regulation, third-party regulation, certification, accreditation or market regulation.\n\nState-mandated regulation is government intervention in the private market in an attempt to implement policy and produce outcomes which might not otherwise occur, ranging from consumer protection to faster growth or technological advancement. The regulations may prescribe or proscribe conduct (\"command-and-control\" regulation), calibrate incentives (\"incentive\" regulation), or change preferences (\"preferences shaping\" regulation). Common examples of regulation include controls on market entries, prices, wages, development approvals, pollution effects, employment for certain people in certain industries, standards of production for certain goods, the military forces and services. The economics of imposing or removing regulations relating to markets is analysed in regulatory economics.\n\nPower to regulate should include the power to enforce regulatory decisions. Monitoring is an important tool used by national regulatory authorities in carrying out the regulated activities.\n\nIn some countries (in particular the Scandinavian countries) industrial relations are to a very high degree regulated by the labour market parties themselves (self-regulation) in contrast to state regulation of minimum wages etc.\n\nRegulations may create costs as well as benefits and may produce unintended reactivity effects, such as defensive practice. Efficient regulations can be defined as those where total benefits exceed total costs.\n\nRegulations can be advocated for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nThe study of formal (legal or official) and informal (extra-legal or unofficial) regulation constitutes one of the central concerns of the sociology of law.\n\nRegulation of businesses existed in the ancient early Egyptian, Indian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. Standardized weights and measures existed to an extent in the ancient world, and gold may have operated to some degree as an international currency. In China, a national currency system existed and paper currency was invented. Sophisticated law existed in Ancient Rome. In the European Early Middle Ages, law and standardization declined with the Roman Empire, but regulation existed in the form of norms, customs, and privileges; this regulation was aided by the unified Christian identity and a sense of honor in regard to contracts.\n\nBeginning in the late 19th and 20th century, much of regulation in the United States was administered and enforced by regulatory agencies which produced their own administrative law and procedures under the authority of statutes. Legislators created these agencies to allow experts in the industry to focus their attention on the issue. At the federal level, one of the earliest institutions was the Interstate Commerce Commission which had its roots in earlier state-based regulatory commissions and agencies. Later agencies include the Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, and various other institutions. These institutions vary from industry to industry and at the federal and state level. Individual agencies do not necessarily have clear life-cycles or patterns of behavior, and they are influenced heavily by their leadership and staff as well as the organic law creating the agency. In the 1930s, lawmakers believed that unregulated business often led to injustice and inefficiency; in the 1960s and 1970s, concern shifted to regulatory capture, which led to extremely detailed laws creating the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18069384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18069384", "title": "Regulation of nanotechnology", "text": "Regulation of nanotechnology\n\nBecause of the ongoing controversy on the implications of nanotechnology, there is significant debate concerning whether nanotechnology or nanotechnology-based products merit special government regulation. This mainly relates to when to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment.\n\nNanotechnology refers to an increasing number of commercially available products – from socks and trousers to tennis racquets and cleaning cloths. Such nanotechnologies and their accompanying industries have triggered calls for increased community participation and effective regulatory arrangements. However, these calls have presently not led to such comprehensive regulation to oversee research and the commercial application of nanotechnologies, or any comprehensive labeling for products that contain nanoparticles or are derived from nano-processes.\n\nRegulatory bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling.\n\nStudies of the health impact of airborne particles generally shown that for toxic materials, smaller particles are more toxic. This is due in part to the fact that, given the same mass per volume, the dose in terms of particle numbers increases as particle size decreases.\n\nBased upon available data, it has been argued that current risk assessment methodologies are not suited to the hazards associated with nanoparticles; in particular, existing toxicological and eco-toxicological methods are not up to the task; exposure evaluation (dose) needs to be expressed as quantity of nanoparticles and/or surface area rather than simply mass; equipment for routine detecting and measuring nanoparticles in air, water, or soil is inadequate; and very little is known about the physiological responses to nanoparticles.\n\nRegulatory bodies in the U.S. as well as in the EU have concluded that nanoparticles form the potential for an entirely new risk and that it is necessary to carry out an extensive analysis of the risk. The challenge for regulators is whether a matrix can be developed which would identify nanoparticles and more complex nanoformulations which are likely to have special toxicological properties or whether it is more reasonable for each particle or formulation to be tested separately.\n\nThe maintains a database and Virtual Journal of scientific papers on environmental, health and safety research on nanoparticles. The database currently has over 2000 entries indexed by particle type, exposure pathway and other criteria. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) currently lists 807 products that manufacturers have voluntarily identified that use nanotechnology. No labeling is required by the FDA so that number could be significantly higher. \"The use of nanotechnology in consumer products and industrial applications is growing rapidly, with the products listed in the PEN inventory showing just the tip of the iceberg\" according to PEN Project Director David Rejeski . A list of those products that have been voluntarily disclosed by their manufacturers is located here .\n\nThe Material Safety Data Sheet that must be issued for certain materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only.\n\nMany argue that government has a responsibility to provide opportunities for the public to be involved in the development of new forms of science and technology. Community engagement can be achieved through various means or mechanisms. An online journal article identifies traditional approaches such as referenda, consultation documents, and advisory committees that include community members and other stakeholders. Other conventional approaches include public meetings and \"closed\" dialog with stakeholders. More contemporary engagement processes that have been employed to include community members in decisions about nanotechnology include citizens' juries and consensus conferences. Leach and Scoones (2006, p. 45) argue that since that “most debates about science and technology options involve uncertainty, and often ignorance, public debate about regulatory regimes is essential.”\n\nIt has been argued that limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology, and that the development of comprehensive regulation of nanotechnology will be vital to ensure that the potential risks associated with the research and commercial application of nanotechnology do not overshadow its potential benefits. Regulation may also be required to meet community expectations about responsible development of nanotechnology, as well as ensuring that public interests are included in shaping the development of nanotechnology.\n\nCommunity education, engagement and consultation tend to occur \"downstream\": once there is at least a moderate level of awareness, and often during the process of disseminating and adapting technologies. \"Upstream\" engagement, by contrast, occurs much earlier in the innovation cycle and involves: \"dialogue and debate about future technology options and pathways, bringing the often expert-led approaches to horizon scanning, technology foresight and scenario planning to involve a wider range of perspectives and inputs.\" Daniel Sarewitz Director of Arizona State University’s Consortium on Science, Policy and Outcomes, argues that \"by the time new devices reach the stage of commercialization and regulation, it is usually too late to alter them to correct problems.\" However, Xenos, et al. argue that upstream engagement can be utilized in this area through anticipated discussion with peers. Upstream engagement in this sense is \"meant to create the best possible conditions for sound policy making and public judgments based on carefull assessment of objective information\". Discussion may act as a catalyst for upstream engagement by prompting accountability for individuals to seek and process additional information (\"anticipatory elaboration\"). However, though anticipated discussion did lead to participants seeking further information, Xenos et al. found that factual information was not primarily sought out; instead, individuals sought out opinion pieces and editorials.\n\nThe stance that the research, development and use of nanotechnology should be subject to control by the public sector is sometimes referred to as nanosocialism.\n\nThe question of whether nanotechnology represents something 'new' must be answered to decide how best nanotechnology should be regulated. The Royal Society recommended that the UK government assess chemicals in the form of nanoparticles or nanotubes as new substances. Subsequent to this, in 2007 a coalition of over forty groups called for nanomaterials to be classified as new substances, and regulated as such.\n\nDespite these recommendations, chemicals comprising nanoparticles that have previously been subject to assessment and regulation may be exempt from regulation, regardless of the potential for different risks and impacts. In contrast, nanomaterials are often recognized as 'new' from the perspective of intellectual property rights (IPRs), and as such are commercially protected via patenting laws.\n\nThere is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) – by \"bolting on\" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively \"slip through the cracks\" without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency. Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and zinc oxide (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage \"in vitro\", such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the stratum corneum of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the precautionary principle in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases. Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed prepainted steel roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen. Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies.\n\nNanomedicines are just beginning to enter drug regulatory processes, but within a few decades could comprise a dominant group within the class of innovative pharmaceuticals, the current thinking of government safety and cost-effectiveness regulators appearing to be that these products give rise to few if any nano-specific issues. Some academics (such as Thomas Alured Faunce) have challenged that proposition and suggest that nanomedicines may create unique or heightened policy challenges for government systems of cost-effectiveness as well as safety regulation. There are also significant public good aspects to the regulation of nanotechnology, particularly with regard to ensuring that industry involvement in standard-setting does not become a means of reducing competition and that nanotechnology policy and regulation encourages new models of safe drug discovery and development more systematically targeted at the global burden of disease.\n\nSelf-regulation attempts may well fail, due to the inherent conflict of interest in asking any organization to police itself. If the public becomes aware of this failure, an external, independent organization is often given the duty of policing them, sometimes with highly punitive measures taken against the organization.\nThe Food and Drug Administration notes that it only regulates on the basis of voluntary claims made by the product manufacturer. If no claims are made by a manufacturer, then the FDA may be unaware of nanotechnology being employed.\n\nYet regulations worldwide still fail to distinguish between materials in their nanoscale and bulk form. This means that nanomaterials remain effectively unregulated; there is no regulatory requirement for nanomaterials to face new health and safety testing or environmental impact assessment prior to their use in commercial products, if these materials have already been approved in bulk form. The health risks of nanomaterials are of particular concern for workers who may face occupational exposure to nanomaterials at higher levels, and on a more routine basis, than the general public.\n\nThere is no international regulation of nanoproducts or the underlying nanotechnology. Nor are there any internationally agreed definitions or terminology for nanotechnology, no internationally agreed protocols for toxicity testing of nanoparticles, and no standardized protocols for evaluating the environmental impacts of nanoparticles.\n\nSince products that are produced using nanotechnologies will likely enter international trade, it is argued that it will be necessary to harmonize nanotechnology standards across national borders. There is concern that some countries, most notably developing countries, will be excluded from international standards negotiations. The Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards notes that “developing countries should have a say in international nanotechnology standards development, even if they lack capacity to enforce the standards\". (p. 14).\n\nConcerns about monopolies and concentrated control and ownership of new nanotechnologies were raised in community workshops in Australia in 2004.\n\nWide use of the term nanotechnology in recent years has created the impression that regulatory frameworks are suddenly having to contend with entirely new challenges that they are unequipped to deal with. Many regulatory systems around the world already assess new substances or products for safety on a case by case basis, before they are permitted on the market. These regulatory systems have been assessing the safety of nanometre scale molecular arrangements for many years and many substances comprising nanometre scale particles have been in use for decades e.g. Carbon black, Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, Bentonite, Aluminum silicate, Iron oxides, Silicon dioxide, Diatomaceous earth, Kaolin, Talc, Montmorillonite, Magnesium oxide, Copper sulphate.\n\nThese existing approval frameworks almost universally use the best available science to assess safety and do not approve substances or products with an unacceptable risk benefit profile. One proposal is to simply treat particle size as one of the several parameters defining a substance to be approved, rather than creating special rules for all particles of a given size regardless of type. A major argument against special regulation of nanotechnology is that the projected applications with the greatest impact are far in the future, and it is unclear how to regulate technologies whose feasibility is speculative at this point. In the meantime, it has been argued that the immediate applications of nanomaterials raise challenges not much different from those of introducing any other new material, and can be dealt with by minor tweaks to existing regulatory schemes rather than sweeping regulation of entire scientific fields.\n\nA truly precautionary approach to regulation could severely impede development in the field of nanotechnology safety studies are required for each and every nanoscience application. While the outcome of these studies can form the basis for government and international regulations, a more reasonable approach might be development of a risk matrix that identifies likely culprits.\n\nIn its seminal 2004 report \"Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies: Opportunities and Uncertainties\", the United Kingdom's Royal Society concluded that:\n\nbut have recommended that nanomaterials be regulated as new chemicals, that research laboratories and factories treat nanomaterials \"as if they were hazardous\", that release of nanomaterials into the environment be avoided as far as possible, and that products containing nanomaterials be subject to new safety testing requirements prior to their commercial release.\n\nThe 2004 report by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineers noted that existing UK regulations did not require additional testing when existing substances were produced in nanoparticulate form. The Royal Society recommended that such regulations were revised so that “chemicals produced in the form of nanoparticles and nanotubes be treated as new chemicals under these regulatory frameworks” (p.xi). They also recommended that existing regulation be modified on a precautionary basis because they expect that “the toxicity of chemicals in the form of free nanoparticles and nanotubes cannot be predicted from their toxicity in a larger form and... in some cases they will be more toxic than the same mass of the same chemical in larger form.”\n\nThe Better Regulation Commission's earlier 2003 report had recommended that the UK Government:\n\nThese recommendations were accepted in principle by the UK Government. Noting that there was “no obvious focus for an informed public debate of the type suggested by the Task Force”, the UK government's response was to accept the recommendations.\n\nThe Royal Society's 2004 report identified two distinct governance issues:\n\nRather than adopt a new nano-specific regulatory framework, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convenes an 'interest group' each quarter with representatives of FDA centers that have responsibility for assessment and regulation of different substances and products. This interest group ensures coordination and communication. A September 2009 FDA document called for identifying sources of nanomaterials, how they move in the environment, the problems they might cause for people, animals and plants, and how these problems could be avoided or mitigated.\n\nThe Bush administration in 2007 decided that no special regulations or labeling of nanoparticles were required. Critics derided this as treating consumers like a \"guinea pig\" without sufficient notice due to lack of labelling.\n\nBerkeley, CA is currently the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology. Cambridge, MA in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but the committee it instituted to study the issue Cambridge recommended against regulation in its final report, recommending instead other steps to facilitate information-gathering about potential effects of nanomaterials.\n\nOn December 10, 2008 the U.S. National Research Council released a report calling for more regulation of nanotechnology.\n\nAssembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006) authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) within the California Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to request information on environmental and health impacts from chemical manufacturers and importers, including testing techniques.\n\nIn October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the California Environmental Protection Agency, announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes. DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. These sections were added as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006). They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals.\n\nOn January 22, 2009, a formal information request letter was sent to manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State. This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January 22, 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in.\n\nThe California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on November 16, 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California.\n\nDTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit their website for the latest up-to-date information at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm.\n\nOn December 21, 2010, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) initiated the second Chemical Information Call-in for six nanomaterials: nano cerium oxide, nano silver, nano titanium dioxide, nano zero valent iron, nano zinc oxide, and quantum dots. DTSC sent a formal information request letter to forty manufacturers who produce or import the six nanomaterials in California, or who may export them into the State. The Chemical Information Call-in is meant to identify information gaps of these six nanomaterials and to develop further knowledge of their analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information under California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. DTSC completed the carbon nanotube information call-in in June 2010.\n\nDTSC partners with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Riverside (UCR), University of Southern California (USC), Stanford University, Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEIN), and The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on safe nanomaterial handling practices.\n\nDTSC is interested in expanding the Chemical Information Call-in to members of the bominated flame retardants, members of the methyl siloxanes, ocean plastics, nano-clay, and other emerging chemicals.\n\nThe European Union has formed a group to study the implications of nanotechnology called the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks which has published a list of risks associated with nanoparticles.\n\nConsequently, manufacturers and importers of carbon products, including carbon nano-tubes will have to submit full health and safety data within a year or so in order to comply with REACH.\n\nA number of European member states have called for the creation of either national or European nanomaterials registries. France, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have established national registries of nanomaterials. In Addition, the European Commission requested the Europeach Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to create a European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON) that aims at collecting publically available information on the safety and markets of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. \n\nIn January 2008, a coalition of over 40 civil society groups endorsed a statement of principles calling for precautionary action related to nanotechnology. The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the International Center for Technology Assessment's report \"Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano materials\", which states:\n\nThe group has urged action based on eight principles. They are (1) A Precautionary Foundation (2) Mandatory Nano-specific Regulations (3) Health and Safety of the Public and Workers (4) Environmental Protection (5) Transparency (6) Public Participation (7) Inclusion of Broader Impacts and (8) Manufacturer Liability.\n\nSome NGOs, including Friends of the Earth, are calling for the formation of a separate nanotechnology specific regulatory framework for the regulation of nanotechnology. In Australia, Friends of the Earth propose the establishment of a Nanotechnology Regulatory Coordination Agency, overseen by a Foresight and Technology Assessment Board. The advantage of this arrangement is that it could ensure a centralized body of experts that are able to provide oversight across the range of nano-products and sectors. It is also argued that a centralized regulatory approach would simplify the regulatory environment, thereby supporting industry innovation. A National Nanotechnology Regulator could coordinate existing regulations related to nanotechnology (including intellectual property, civil liberties, product safety, occupation health and safety, environmental and international law). Regulatory mechanisms could vary from \"hard law at one extreme through licensing and codes of practice to 'soft' self-regulation and negotiation in order to influence behavior.\" \nThe formation of national nanotechnology regulatory bodies may also assist in establishing global regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn early 2008, The UK's largest organic certifier, the Soil Association, announced that its organic standard would exclude nanotechnology, recognizing the associated human and environmental health and safety risks. Certified organic standards in Australia exclude engineered nanoparticles. It appears likely that other organic certifiers will also follow suit. The Soil Association was also the first to declare organic standards free from genetic engineering.\n\nRegulation of nanotechnology will require a definition of the size, in which particles and processes are recognized as operating at the nano-scale. The size-defining characteristic of nanotechnology is the subject of significant debate, and varies to include particles and materials in the scale of at least 100 to 300 nanometers (nm). Friends of the Earth Australia recommend defining nano-particles up to 300 nanometers (nm) in size. They argue that \"particles up to a few hundred nanometers in size share many of the novel biological behaviors of nano-particles, including novel toxicity risks\", and that \"nano-materials up to approximately 300 nm in size can be taken up by individual cells\". The UK Soil Association define nanotechnology to include manufactured nano-particles where the mean particle size is 200 nm or smaller. The U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative defines nanotechnology as “the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nm.\n\nRegulatory frameworks for chemicals tend to be triggered by mass thresholds. This is certainly the case for the management of toxic chemicals in Australia through the National pollutant inventory. However, in the case of nanotechnology, nano-particle applications are unlikely to exceed these thresholds (tonnes/kilograms) due to the size and weight of nano-particles. As such, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars questions the usefulness of regulating nanotechnologies on the basis of their size/weight alone. They argue, for example, that the toxicity of nano-participles is more related to surface area than weight, and that emerging regulations should also take account of such factors.\n"}

She is the Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, and professorial fellow of Murray Edwards College, Cambridge.\n\nBorn on 10 September 1951 into a wealthy family of lawyers in London, Coakley attended Blackheath High School. Following this, she spent a gap year teaching English and Latin in Lesotho. Her education continued at New Hall (now Murray Edwards College), University of Cambridge (BA, First Class Honours, 1973) and at Harvard Divinity School (ThM, 1975), to which she went as a Harkness Fellow. Her PhD on Ernst Troeltsch is also from the University of Cambridge (1983).\n\nCoakley has taught at Lancaster University (1976–1991), at Oriel College, Oxford (1991–1993) and at Harvard University in the divinity school (1993–2007; as Mallinckrodt Professor of Divinity, 1995–2007). She was a visiting professor of religion at Princeton University (2003–2004). In 2006, she was elected the Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge (the first woman appointed to this chair) and took up the position in 2007. In 2011, she became Deputy Chair of the School of Arts and Humanities with a four-year appointment on the General Board of the university.\n\nCoakley's teaching and research interests cover a number of disciplines cognate to systematic theology, including the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of science, patristics, feminist theory and the intersections of law and medicine with religion. Her contributions to these areas have generally been by way of co-ordinating research projects and editing or co-editing collections of papers. It was through these collaborative projects that her profile gained a level of international prominence. Indeed, at the time of her appointment to the Norris-Hulse chair in Cambridge, Coakley had not published a monograph subsequent to the 1988 publication of her doctoral thesis. She has been working on a four-volume systematic theology, the first volume of which was published in 2013 as \"God, Sexuality and the Self: An Essay 'On the Trinity\"'.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Coakley co-directed, with Martin A. Nowak, the \"Evolution and Theology of Cooperation\" project at Harvard University, sponsored by the Templeton Foundation, out of which has come a co-edited volume, \"Evolution, Games, and God: The Principle of Cooperation\". An earlier interdisciplinary project on \"Pain and Its Transformations\" undertaken with Arthur Kleinman at Harvard (as part of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative), produced \"Pain and Its Transformations: The Interface of Biology and Culture\" (co-ed. with Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Harvard UP, 2007).\n\nCoakley delivered the Gifford Lectures in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2012.\n\nCoakley was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 2000 and as a priest in 2001. She has assisted in parishes in Waban, Massachusetts, and at Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore, Oxford, England (where she served her title). Her training for the priesthood included periods working in a hospital and a prison. In 2011 she was appointed an honorary canon of Ely Cathedral where she assists with the morning office and Eucharist.\n\nIn 2012, she was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to change Church of England rules to allow women to become bishops.\n\nCoakley is married to J. F. Coakley, a Syriac scholar and fine printer. They have two daughters, who attended Buckingham Browne & Nichols school in Massachusetts. Her brother is a legal adviser to Prince Charles. Her father, a wealthy lawyer and bon viveur, died in September 2016.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4818168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4818168", "title": "Sexualization", "text": "Sexualization\n\nSexualization (or sexualisation) is to make something sexual in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality, especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to sexual objectification. According to the American Psychological Association, sexualization occurs when \"individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness.\" \"In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate.\" Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature. According to the Media Education Foundation's, \"Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women\", the sexualization of girls in media and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture are detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.\n\nReports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements. Research has linked sexualization of young girls to negative consequences for girls and society as a whole, finding that the viewing of sexually objectifying material can contribute to body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, low self-esteem, depression and depressive affect. Medical and social science researchers generally deployed \"sexualization\" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an \"excessive\", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred. American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, \"sexualization\" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single \"feminist perspective on sexualization\" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.\n\nConsumerism and globalization has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all advanced economies, in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.\n\nThe term \"sexualization\" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195). In contrast, the term \"asexualization\" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904). The opposite or antonym to sexualization is desexualization.\n\nIn 2006, an Australian report called \"Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia\" was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:\n\nIn 2007, the American Psychological Association published a report titled \"Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls\", discussed below.\n\nIn 2010, the American Psychological Association published an additional report titled \" Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls\", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.\n\nIn 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' media consumption (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.\n\nHowever, in 2010 the Scottish Executive released a report titled \"External research on sexualised goods aimed at children\". The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:\n\nThe Scottish review also notes that:\n\nIt also notes that previous coverage \"rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified.\"\n\nLetting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)\nThe report 'Letting Children Be Children', also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.\n\nThe Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union, a \"charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world\". The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:\n\nThe report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of \"what we would like to see\". On the theme of \"the wallpaper of children's lives\" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two \"clothing, products and services for children\" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three \"children as consumers\" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of \"making parents voices heard\" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.\n\nThere is a motion for a European Parliament resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: \n\nThe sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women. The media plays a significant role in this sexualization. \"The media are likely to have powerful effects if the information is presented persistently, consistently, and corroborated among forms. As a media affect, stereotypes rely on the repetition to perpetuate and sustain them.\" According to Celine Parrenas Shimizu, \"To see race is to see sex, and vice versa.\"\n\nIn an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society. Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named Sarah Baartman was known as \"Hottentot Venus\" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the \"Jezebel\" stereotype that portrays black women as \"hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled.\"\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows. Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves. White European and American men \"exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies\" because \"they can buy sex for cut-rate prices\". This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes. Even \"women who...worked in Europe have become suspect...\" even if they had a legal job. They have become \"exports\" instead of people because of their sexualization.\n\nThe image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the \"self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women.\" The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a \"self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males.\" According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, \"The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature.\"\n\nStarting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as \"squaw,\" an Algonquin word for vagina. \"The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives.\" Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.\n\nLatina characters that embody the hot Latina stereotype in film and television is marked by easily identifiable behavioral characteristics such as \"'addictively romantic, sensual, sexual and even exotically dangerous', self-sacrificing, dependent, powerless, sexually naive, childlike, pampered, and irresponsible\". Stereotypical Latina physical characteristics include \"red lips, big bottoms, large hips, voluptuous bosoms, and small waists\" and \"high heels, huge hoop earrings, seductive clothing.\" Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are \"'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'\" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation \"uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants.\" The media represents Latinas \"as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire\" or \"[a] dutiful mother\". The sexual implications of the \"hot-blooded\" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people. This has led many to see the Latin people as \"what is morally wrong\" with the United States. Some believe it to be wrong simply because the interpretation of this culture seems to go against white, Western culture. Culturally, the Latina is expected to dress \"as a proper señorita\" in order to be respected as a woman which conflicts with the Western ideals that a girl is sexual if she dresses \"too 'mature' for [her] age\". Even in the business world this stereotype continues; \"tight skirts and jingling bracelets [are misinterpreted] as a come-on\". This sexualization can also be linked to certain stereotypical jobs. The image of the Latina woman often is not in the business world but in the domestic. The sexualization of Latina women sexualizes the positions that they are expected to occupy. Domestic servants, maids, and waitresses are the typical \"media-engendered\" roles that make it difficult for Latinas to gain \"upward mobility\" despite the fact that many hold PhDs.\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image. The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:\n\nSome cultural critics have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.\n\nThe causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing; the lack of parental oversight and discipline; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school sex education programs.\n\nFor girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their \"self-image and healthy development\".\n\nThe APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:\nThe APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by Roberts \"et al\" that found that \"47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day.\" A majority of these magazines focused on a theme of presenting oneself as sexually desirable to men, a practice which is called \"costuming for seduction\" in a study by Duffy and Gotcher.\n\nStudies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.\n\nResearch has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.\n\nResearch suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.\n\nA result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are \"learning how to view themselves as sex objects\". When girls fail to meet the thin ideal and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties. Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.\n\nSome commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:\n\nThe Scottish Executive report surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including Tesco, Debenhams, JJ Sports, and Marks & Spencer did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.\n\nSexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and cultural studies. Here, the term has not been used to simply to label what is seen as a social problem, but to indicate the much broader and varied set of ways in which sex has become more visible in media and culture. These include;\nthe widespread discussion of sexual values, practices and identities in the media;\nthe growth of sexual media of all kinds; for example, erotica, slash fiction, sexual self-help books and the many genres of pornography; \nthe emergence of new forms of sexual experience, for example instant message or avatar sex made possible by developments in technology; \na public concern with the breakdown of consensus about regulations for defining and dealing with obscenity; \nthe prevalence of scandals, controversies and panics around sex in the media.\n\nThe terms \"pornification\" and \"pornographication\" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices \"citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics\" have become more prominent. This process, which Brian McNair has described as a \"pornographication of the mainstream\". has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or \"pornosphere\" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a \"striptease culture\" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.\n\nChildren and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.\n\nSexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as \"seductive and sexy\". It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse \"where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood\".\n\nThe Australian writers, Catharine Lumby and Kath Albury (2010) have suggested that sexualization is \"a debate that has been simmering for almost a decade\" and concerns about sex and the media are far from new. Much of the recent writing on sexualization has been the subject of criticism that because of the way that it draws on \"one-sided, selective, overly simplifying, generalizing, and negatively toned\" evidence and is \"saturated in the languages of concern and regulation\". In these writings and the widespread press coverage that they have attracted, critics state that the term is often used as \"a non-sequitur causing everything from girls flirting with older men to child sex trafficking\" They believe that the arguments often ignore feminist work on media, gender and the body and present a very conservative and negative view of sex in which only monogamous heterosexual sexuality is regarded as normal. They say that the arguments tend to neglect any historical understanding of the way sex has been represented and regulated, and they often ignore both theoretical and empirical work on the relationship between sex and media, culture and technology.\n\nThe sexualization of women being influenced by society is a problem that should be avoided due to its impact on how women value and present themselves. The way society shapes ones personal interest is presented in a book review of \"Girls Gone Skank\" by Patrice Oppliger, Amanda Mills states that \"consequently, girls are socialized to participate in their own abuse by becoming avid consumers of and altering their behavior to reflect sexually exploitative images and goods.\" The belief that women are powerful and fully capable as men is stated in the text \"Uses Of The Erotic: The Erotic As Power\" by Audre Lorde stating that the suppression of the erotic of women has led them feeling superior to men \"the superficially, erotic had been encouraged as a sign of female inferiority on the other hand women have been made to suffer and to feel opposed contemptible and suspect by virtue of its existence\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30973103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30973103", "title": "State of Defence (Germany)", "text": "State of Defence (Germany)\n\nThe state of defence (in German: Verteidigungsfall or V-Fall) is the constitutional state of emergency in Germany if the country is \"under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack\". Established by a constitutional amendment in 1968 during the Cold War, this state of emergency gives the federal government extraordinary powers in wartime. It is laid down in the articles 115a to 115l (title Xa) of the German Constitution. As of October 2018, Germany has never been in the state of defence.\n\nAccording to article 115a of the German Constitution, the State of Defence shall be declared if \"the federal territory [of the Federal Republic of Germany] is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack\".\n\nThe normal procedure is that, upon request of the Federal Government, the Bundestag determines that the conditions of the State of Defence exist. That means that the Bundestag does not actually declare the State of Defence; instead, it just decides whether it exists or not. (If, for example, a foreign army invaded Germany, the Bundestag would determine that the action is an \"attack by armed force\", as described in article 115a, and so Germany is in the State of Defence.) The determination requires at least two thirds of the votes of the Bundestag present at that time (at least half of the members being the quorum). It also has to be approved by the Bundesrat with more than half of its members, which, according to general Bundesrat protocol, is given in bundled form by each Land.\n\nIf the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or not able to reach a quorum, the \"Joint Committee\" decides on their behalf.\n\nIf Germany is under attack by armed force and the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and the Joint Committee are not able to determine the State of Defence immediately, \"the determination shall be deemed to have been made and promulgated at the time the attack began\". If, for example, an invasion started on January 4 at 4:17 a.m., Germany would be in the State of Defence from that time, and the government could react immediately.)\n\nAccording to Article 115b GG, the Federal Chancellor becomes Commander-in-chief of the armed forces. (Normally, the Minister of Defence holds that post.)\n\nAccording to Article 115c GG, the federal government has extended legislative powers:\n\n\nThe normal legislative procedure is replaced by a faster one:\n\nThe \"Joint Committee\" (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) consists of members of the Bundestag and members of the Bundesrat. Two thirds of the committee members are provided by the Bundestag, one third provided by the Bundesrat. The committee members of the Bundestag are designated by the Bundestag \"in proportion to the relative strength of the various parliamentary groups\". Every Land is represented by a Bundesrat member. The committee members of the Bundestag must not be members of the Cabinet, and the committee members of the Bundesrat are exceptionally \"not bound by instructions\". There are thus 16 members of the Bundesrat (one for each Land), and 32 members of the Bundestag (twice the number of Bundesrat members), giving it a total number of 48 members. The members of the Joint Committee and their deputies are already designated during peacetime.\n\nThe Joint Committee takes over the tasks of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat if, during the State of Defence, it determines, with a two-thirds majority of its vote, that either the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or reach a quorum. That majority must include at least a majority of all committee members (at least 25 members). For example, if only 30 committee members could be reached, 20 votes would be a two-thirds majority, but at least 25 votes would be required for the determination. If the Joint Committee is not able to reach full strength (48 members), the Bundestag (in case of missing or dead Bundestag committee members) and/or the state governments (in case of missing or dead Bundesrat committee members) designate new committee members.\n\nThe Joint Committee takes over any task normally dealt by the Bundestag and/or the Bundesrat. All decisions which would normally be made by the either the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat, or both of them, is made by the entire Joint Committee. However, there are some limitations to the power of the Joint Committee (when compared to Bundestag and Bundesrat):\n\nThe Joint Committee is based on Articles 53a \"(Composition - Rules of procedure)\" and 115e \"(Joint Committee)\" of the constitution, as well as on own rules of procedure.\n\nAccording to article 115f, paragraph (1), clause 1 GG, the Federal Government may employ the Federal Border Guard throughout the federal territory, everywhere in Germany. By law a Compulsory Border Guard Service is still in force, but will only be executed in the state of defence or if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police.\n\nWhen the Emergency Acts were passed, the Federal Border Guard was a paramilitary police force responsible only for the protection of West Germany's external land and sea borders. Over the decades, however, the role of the Federal Border Guard and even its name have changed to Federal Police. The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the railway network, airport security and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title Xa has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term \"Federal Border Guard\" is still used in the constitution.\n\nAccording to article 115f, paragraph (1), clause 2 GG, the federal government may issue instructions to state governments and state authorities. (Normally, state governments act on their own, and Land authorities receive their orders only from the Land government.)\n\nAccording to article 115h GG, electoral terms that would expire during the State of Defence are extended:\n\nIn 2011, the German Conscription Act was changed to abolish peacetime conscription. From July 1, conscripts may not be drafted except during a State of Tension or a State of Defence.\n\nAccording to Article 115l GG, the State of Defence ends when it is ended by the Bundestag \"if the conditions for determining it no longer exist\", such as after a peace treaty is signed.\n\n"}
{"id": "1674433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1674433", "title": "Tiao-kuai", "text": "Tiao-kuai\n\nThe tiao-kuai () system, also known as tiáotiáo-kuàikuài () to emphasize the plurality, describes the quasi-federal arrangement of administration in the People's Republic of China. The term \"tiáo\" refers to the vertical lines of authority over various sector reaching down from the ministries of the central government. \"Kuài\" refers to the horizontal level of authority of the territorial government at the provincial or local level. According to political scientist Kenneth Lieberthal, \"The former coordinates according to function ([for] example, environment); the latter coordinates according to the needs of the locality that it governs.\" Thus a local environmental protection bureau may have reporting responsibilities to both the central government's State Environmental Protection Administration and to the mayor of the city in which it is located.\n\nConstitutionally, organizations in both the functional and territorial systems of governance are assigned to a system of ranks. Central ministries are at the same rank as provincial governments. Writes Lieberthal, \"One key rule of the Chinese system is that units of the same rank cannot issue binding orders to each other. Operationally, this means that no ministry can issue a binding order to a province.\" This means a province may challenge, overrule, or ignore decisions made by a ministry. This two-dimensional arrangement sometimes creates undesirable conflicts, and there have been calls for tiao-kuai integration (), although this is unlikely to occur due to resistance from the provinces.\n\nIn 1949, the Chinese Revolution established the People's Republic of China, a constitutionally socialist state. While China experimented with centralization and decentralization policies for a few years, the Anti-Rightist Movement in 1957 solidified the principle of ideological unity among all local governments. During the Cultural Revolution, and especially the 1971-1975 \"unified income and unified expenditure\" () period, bureaucrats across China implemented similar agricultural and industrial policies modeled in Beijing.\n\nWith the death of Mao Zedong and the beginning of the Chinese economic reform, China adopted a policy of \"emancipation of mind (from ideology)\" () as the government sought practical solutions to economic problems that reflected local conditions. Provinces were given substantial economic and political authority, such as to authorize investment projects and raise their own taxes. The State Planning Commission's mandate shifted from giving annual targets to planning for the medium and long term. The central government further established special economic zones within the coastal provinces, which the relevant subnational governments have operated and expanded upon, even establishing sister city relations internationally.\n\nDecentralization posed a problem for the central government in that the central government had no independent means of enforcing its authority to prevent local protectionism or enforce standards. Hence in the 1990s, the PRC government began creating parallel central organizations to those of the provinces. Most of these organizations deal with economic regulations. Devolution of political power to provincial People's Congresses have also occasionally caused vertical conflict, such as when Beijing appointed Ge Hongsheng as the Governor of Zhejiang, who was voted out by the Zhejiang parliament in 1993. The central government now consults with provincial representatives before making sensitive personnel appointments.\n\nOn the other hand, the rapid rise in the number of prefecture-level cities as a result of urbanization has checked the power of the provinces. The Central Military Commission's control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA) also precludes the possibility of local separatists colluding with the military against the central government.\n\nAn analogous situation can be seen in federal systems such as the United States where the federal and state governments operate in parallel, but neither has the authority to command the other in relation to reserve powers or federal powers expressly delegated to the national government. Although the power relationships are similar the actual powers exercised can be quite different. For example, there are parallel institutions for police and financial securities regulation in the United States, but not in the PRC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2876153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2876153", "title": "Venice Commission", "text": "Venice Commission\n\nThe Venice Commission is an advisory body of the Council of Europe, composed of independent experts in the field of constitutional law. It was created in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, at a time of urgent need for constitutional assistance in Central and Eastern Europe. The Commission's official name is the European Commission for Democracy through Law, but due to its meeting place in Venice, Italy, where sessions take place four times a year, it is usually referred to as the Venice Commission.\n\nStarting with 18 member states, soon all member states of the Council of Europe joined the Venice Commission and since 2002 non-European states can also become full members. As of 13 July 2014, the Commission counts 60 member states – the 47 member states of the Council of Europe and 13 other countries. Belarus is an associate member and there are five observers. The Palestinian National Authority and South Africa have a special co-operation status similar to that of the observers. The EU, OSCE/ODIHR and IACL/AIDC (International Association of Constitutional Law / ) participate in the plenary sessions of the Commission.\n\nThe members are \"senior academics, particularly in the fields of constitutional or international law, supreme or constitutional court judges or members of national parliaments\". Acting on the Commission in their individual capacity, the members are appointed for four years by the participating countries. The current and former members include,\namongst other notable academics and judges:\n\nThe president of the Commission, since December 2009, is its former Secretary General Mr Gianni Buquicchio, whilst his predecessor, Mr Jan Erik Helgesen, Professor at the University of Oslo, is elected 1st Vice-President. The new Secretary General of the Commission, who is the head of the Commission's secretariat at the Council of Europe's headquarters in Strasbourg, France, is Mr Thomas Markert.\n\nThe main focus of the work of the Venice Commission is on draft constitutions and constitutional amendments but the Commission also covers para-constitutional law, i.e. laws which are close to the Constitution, such as minority legislation or electoral law.\n\nRequests for opinions come from the participating states and the organs of the Council of Europe or international organisations or bodies participating in the Venice Commission’s work. The opinions adopted by the Commission are not binding but are mostly followed by member states.\n\nThe areas of the Commission's activities are as follows:\n\nThe Venice Commission's primary task is to assist and advise individual countries in constitutional matters in order to improve functioning of democratic institutions and the protection of human rights. Already in 1991 the Commission helped in creating the first democratic Constitution of Romania since 1947. In 2012, in an invited Opinion, the Venice Commission expressed several criticisms of church-related legislation in Hungary.\n\nThe working method adopted by the Commission when providing opinions is to appoint a working group of rapporteurs (primarily from amongst its members) which advises national authorities in the preparation of the relevant law. After discussions with the national authorities and stakeholders in the country, the working group prepares a draft opinion on whether the legislative text meets the democratic standards in its field and on how to improve it on the basis of common experience. The draft opinion is discussed and adopted by the Venice Commission during a plenary session, usually in the presence of representatives from that country. After adoption, the opinion becomes public and is forwarded to the requesting body.\n\nAlthough its opinions are generally reflected in the adopted legislation, the Venice Commission does not impose its solutions, but adopts a non-directive approach based on dialogue. For this reason the working group, as a rule, visits the country concerned and meets with the different political actors involved in the issue in order to ensure the most objective view of the situation.\n\nA political agreement settling a conflict should be supported by a viable legal text. It may also be possible for an agreement on a legal text to foster a political solution. For this reason the Venice Commission pays particular attention to countries which are going through or have gone through ethno-political conflicts.\nIn this context, at the European Union’s request, the Venice Commission has played an important role in developing and interpreting the constitutional law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro as well as that of Kosovo. It has also been involved in efforts to settle the conflicts on the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Transnistria in Moldova.\n\nThe Commission drafts opinions, initiates studies and organises conferences inter alia on:\n\nThe work of the Commission in the field of elections, referendums and political parties is steered by the Council for Democratic Elections (CDE). The CDE is made up of representatives of the Venice Commission, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. The aim of the Council for Democratic Elections is to ensure co-operation in the electoral field between the Venice Commission as a legal body and the Parliamentary Assembly and the Congress of the Council of Europe as political bodies in charge of election observation, in order to promote the European common values in this field – the principles of the European electoral heritage.\n\nThe Commission identifies and develops standards in the area of elections through:\n\n\nAnother branch of the Commission's activities includes co-operation with the constitutional courts and equivalent bodies. Since its creation, the Venice Commission has been aware that it is not sufficient to assist the states in the adoption of democratic constitutions but that these texts have to be implemented in reality. Key players in this field are constitutional courts and equivalent bodies exercising constitutional jurisdiction.\n\nCooperation with Constitutional Courts, ordinary courts and ombudspersons is done by means of:\n\n\nThe Commission's transnational activities enable it to carry out the main duties laid down in its Statute, which are to improve the functioning of democratic institutions, knowledge of legal systems and understanding of the legal culture of countries working with it.\n\nWhile most of the work of the Commission is country specific, the Commission also prepares, through its own initiative and at request of outside bodies such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, studies and reports addressing topics of general interest in the member and observer states. Transnational topics are also covered in the Unidem seminars (University for Democracy) and published in the Science and Technique of Democracy collection.\n\nComparative studies on topics to do with the functioning of democracy offer initial overviews of the law in various countries. Such a comparative approach then makes it possible to identify constitutional values that are shared throughout Europe and, where relevant, any areas of weakness. The third stage is that of harmonisation, in which, on the basis of Commission recommendations, the principles concerned are incorporated into the law of those countries where they have not yet been established.\n\nThe UniDem seminars bring leading specialists from the political and academic worlds and constitutional courts (or equivalent bodies) and the Commission into contact with, for example, a specific university or constitutional court. Reports are presented on particular countries or specific aspects of the topics under discussion. By allowing exchanges between specialists from a variety of backgrounds, the UniDem seminars help to define the rules common to democratic states in which human rights and the rule of law are respected.\n\nIn 2009, the Venice Commission attracted rare news coverage for its opinion that \"blasphemy should not be illegal\".\n\nAs part of its report, \"European Commission for Democracy Through Law: Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, Guidelines and Explanatory Reports adopted October 2002\", the Venice Commission recommended a number of considerations, also when dealing with issues of boundary delimitation.\n\nIn December 2017, the Venice Commission published a report where, invoking Article 7 of the founding treaty, the Commission threatened Poland with losing its voting rights after the Polish government attempted measures to reshape and control the Polish Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "630522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=630522", "title": "Voting age", "text": "Voting age\n\nA voting age is a minimum age established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to vote in a public election. Today, the most common voting age is 18 years; however, voting ages as low as 16 and as high as 25 currently exist (see list below). Most countries have set a minimum voting age, often set in their constitution. In a number of countries voting is compulsory for those eligible to vote, while in most it is optional.\n\nWhen the right to vote was being established in democracies, the voting age was generally set at 21 or higher. In the 1970s many countries reduced the voting age to 18. The debate is ongoing in a number of countries on proposals to reduce the voting age to or below 18.\n\nIn 1890, Law No. 5, 1890, of the South African Republic set a voting age there of 16 years.\n\nBefore the Second World War of 1939–1945, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. In 1946 Czechoslovakia became the first state to reduce the voting age to 20 years, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age. Many countries, particularly in Western Europe, reduced their voting ages to 18 years during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom (1969), with the United States (26th Amendment) (1971), Canada, West Germany (1972), Australia (1974), France (1974), and others following soon afterwards. By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher. It was argued that young men could be drafted to go to war at 18, and many people felt they should be able to vote at the age of 18.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries voting ages were lowered to 16 in India, Switzerland, Austria, and Morocco. Japan lowered its voting age from 20 to 18 in June 2016. a dispute continued in the Maldives.\n\nAround the year 2000, a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favour of a reduction to 16. The earliest moves came during the 1990s, when the voting age for municipal elections in some States of Germany was lowered to 16. Lower Saxony was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states did likewise.\n\nArguments against lowering the voting age to sixteen include lack of political maturity. On the other hand, one of the major arguments for lowering the voting age to 16 is that at this age in most countries a person has reached the legal working age for most jobs and is liable to pay taxes and therefore should not have to pay taxes without the right to political representation.\n\nDuring the 2000s several proposals for a reduced voting age were put forward in U.S. states, including California, Florida and Alaska, but none was successful. A national reduction was proposed in 2005 in Canada and in the Australian state of New South Wales, but these proposals were not adopted. In May 2009, Danish Member of Parliament Mogens Jensen presented an initiative to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to lower the voting age in Europe to 16.\n\nA report suggesting that consideration be given to reducing the voting age to 16 in the Australian Capital Territory in Canberra, Australia was tabled in the territorial legislature on 26 September 2007 and defeated.\n\nIn 2015, federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that the voting age should be lowered to 16.\n\nIn 2007, Austria became the first member of the European Union to adopt a voting age of 16 for most purposes. The voting age had been reduced in Austria from 19 to 18 at all levels in 1992. At that time a voting age of 16 was proposed by the Green Party, but was not adopted.\n\nThe voting age for municipal elections in some states was lowered to 16 shortly after 2000. Three states had made the reduction by 2003 (Burgenland, Carinthia and Styria), and in May 2003 Vienna became the fourth. Salzburg followed suit, and so by the start of 2005 the total had reached at least five states out of nine. As a consequence of state law, reduction of the municipal voting age in the states of Burgenland, Salzburg and Vienna resulted in the reduction of the regional voting age in those states as well.\n\nAfter the 2006 election, the winning SPÖ-ÖVP coalition announced on 12 January 2007 that one of its policies would be the reduction of the voting age to 16 for elections in all states and at all levels in Austria. The policy was set in motion by a Government announcement on 14 March, and a bill proposing an amendment to the Constitution was presented to the legislature on 2 May. On 5 June the National Council approved the proposal following a recommendation from its Constitution Committee. During the passage of the bill through the chamber relatively little opposition was raised to the reduction, with four out of five parties explicitly supporting it; indeed, there was some dispute over which party had been the first to suggest the idea. Greater controversy surrounded the other provisions of the bill concerning the \"Briefwahl\", or postal vote, and the extension of the legislative period for the National Council from four to five years. A further uncontroversial inclusion was a reduction in the candidacy age from 19 to 18. The Federal Council approved the Bill on 21 June, with no party voting against it. The voting age was reduced when the Bill's provisions came into force on 1 July 2007. Austria thus became the first member of the European Union, and the first of the developed world democracies, to adopt a voting age of 16 for all purposes. Lowering the voting age encouraged political interest in young people in Austria. More sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds voted than eighteen-to-twenty-one-year-olds in Austria.\n\nBrazil lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 in the 1988 constitution. The presidential election of 1989 was the first with the lower voting age. People between the ages 18 and 70 are required to vote.\n\nIran had been unique in awarding suffrage at 15, but raised the age to 18 in January 2007 despite the opposition of the Government. In May 2007 the Iranian Cabinet proposed a bill to reverse the increase.\n\nLuxembourg has compulsory voting from the age of 18. A proposal by the government to introduce optional voting for those aged 16 and 17 was rejected by 81% of voters in a June 2015 referendum.\n\nOn 20 November 2013, Malta lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 for local elections starting from 2015. The proposal had wide support from both the government and opposition, social scientists and youth organizations.\n\nOn Monday 29 January 2018, the Maltese Parliament debated to lower the voting age to 16 for general elections, European Parliament Elections and referenda.\n\nOn Monday, 5 March 2018, the Maltese Parliament unanimously voted in favour of amending the constitution, lowering the official voting age from 18 to 16, making Malta the second state in the EU to lower its voting age to 16.\n\nThe New Zealand Green Party MP Sue Bradford announced on 21 June 2007 that she intended to introduce her \"Civics Education and Voting Age Bill\" on the next occasion upon which a place became available for the consideration of Members' Bills. When this happened on 25 July Bradford abandoned the idea, citing an adverse public reaction. The Bill would have sought to reduce the voting age to 16 in New Zealand and make civics education part of the compulsory curriculum in schools.\n\nThe \"Representation of the People Act 1969\" lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, with effect from 1970 and remained in force until the \"Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013\" which allowed 16 year olds to vote for the first time, but only in Scotland and only in that particular referendum. The Scottish Parliament reduced the voting age to 16 for its own and Scottish local elections in 2015.\n\nMen in military service who turned 19 during the first world war were entitled to vote in 1918 irrespective of their age as part of the \"Representation of the People Act 1918\" which also allowed some women over the age of 30 to vote. The Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 brought the voting age for women down to 21.\n\nThe reduction of the voting age to 16 in the United Kingdom was first given serious consideration on 15 December 1999, when the House of Commons considered in Committee an amendment proposed by Simon Hughes to the \"Representation of the People Bill\". This was the first time the reduction of a voting age below 18 had ever been put to a vote in the Commons. The Government opposed the amendment, and it was defeated by 434 votes to 36.\n\nThe Votes at 16 coalition, a group of political and charitable organisations supporting a reduction of the voting age to 16, was launched on 29 January 2003. At that time a Private Member's Bill was also proposed in the House of Lords by Lord Lucas, and received a Second Reading on 9 January.\n\nIn 2004, the UK Electoral Commission conducted a major consultation on the subject of the voting and candidacy ages, and received a significant response. In its conclusions it recommended that the voting age remain at 18. On 29 November 2005 the House of Commons voted 136-128 (on a free vote) against a Private Member's Bill for a reduction in the voting age to 16 proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams. Parliament chose not to include a provision reducing the voting age in the Electoral Administration Act during its passage in 2006.\n\nOn 27 February 2006, the report of the Power Inquiry called for a reduction of the voting age, and of the candidacy age for the House of Commons, to 16. On the same day the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, indicated in an article in \"The Guardian\" that he favoured a reduction provided it was made concurrently with effective citizenship education.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Justice published on 3 July 2007 a Green Paper entitled \"The Governance of Britain\", in which it proposed the establishment of a \"Youth Citizenship Commission\". The Commission would examine the case for lowering the voting age. On launching the Paper in the House of Commons, PM Gordon Brown said: \"Although the voting age has been 18 since 1969, it is right, as part of that debate, to examine, and hear from young people themselves, whether lowering that age would increase participation.\"\n\nDuring the Youth Parliament debates of 30 October 2009 in the House of Commons, Votes at 16 was debated and young people of that age group voted for it overwhelmingly as a campaign priority. Since that debate the issue has been raised in Prime Minister's Questions and has also gained the widespread support of the major political parties.\n\nIn April 2015, Labour announced that it would support the policy if it won an overall majority in the 2015 general election, which it failed to do.\n\nThere was some criticism about not reducing the voting age to 16 years for the referendum on the membership in the European Union in 2016.\n\nThe Scottish National Party conference voted unanimously on 27 October 2007 for a policy of reducing the voting age to 16, as well as in favour of a campaign for the necessary power to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.\n\nIn September 2011, it was announced that the voting age was likely to be reduced from 18 to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum. This was approved by the Scottish Parliament in June 2013.\n\nIn June 2015, the Scottish Parliament voted unanimously to reduce the voting age to 16 for elections for the Scottish Parliament and for Scottish local government elections.\n\nMoves to lower the voting age to 16 were successful in each of the three British Crown dependencies from 2006 to 2008. The Isle of Man was the first to amend its law, when in July 2006 it reduced the voting age to 16 for its general elections, with the House of Keys approving the move by 19 votes to 4.\n\nJersey followed suit on 4 July 2007, when it approved in principle a reduction of the voting age to 16. The States of Jersey voted narrowly in favour, by 25 votes to 21, and the legislative amendments were adopted on 26 September. The law was sanctioned by Order in Council on 12 December, and was brought into force on 1 April, in time for the general elections in late 2008.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, a proposal for a reduction made by the House Committee of the States of Guernsey, and approved by the States' Policy Committee, was adopted by the assembly by 30 votes to 15. An Order in Council sanctioning the law was made on 12 December, and it was registered at the Court of Guernsey on 19 December. It came into force immediately, and the voting age was accordingly reduced in time for the Guernsey general election, 2008.\n\nAlderney and Sark, each part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, have autonomy in deciding the question. Both have yet to favour a reduction to 16.\n\nIn the United States, the debate about lowering voting age from 21 to 18 began during World War II and intensified during the Vietnam War, when most of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote, and the image of young men being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of voting successfully pressured legislators to lower the voting age nationally and in many states. By 1968, several states had lowered the voting age below 21 years: Alaska and Hawaii's minimum age was 20, Kentucky's was 19, and Georgia's was 18. In 1970, the Supreme Court in \"Oregon v. Mitchell\" ruled that Congress had the right to regulate the minimum voting age in federal elections; however, not at local and state level.\n\nThe 26th Amendment (passed and ratified in 1971) prevents states from setting a voting age higher than 18. Except for the express limitations provided for in Amendments XIV, XV, XIX and XXVI, voter qualifications for House and Senate elections are largely delegated to the States under Article I, Section 2 and Amendment XVII of the United States Constitution, which respectively state that \"The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and \"the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature\".\" and \"The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The \"electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures\".\"\n\n21 states permit 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections and caucuses if they will be 18 by election day: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, Vermont, and Washington. Alaska, Kansas, North Dakota and Washington allow 17-year-olds to participate in Democrat caucuses, but not in the Republican caucus. Minnesota allows 17-year-olds to participate in presidential caucuses, but may not vote in primary elections for other offices. New Hampshire allows anyone who will be 18 years old by the time of next election to register, meaning some 17-year-olds can register to vote in this state.\n\nCurrently, the Maine Green Independent Party, the state branch of the Green Party of the United States, calls for the lowering of the voting age to 17. Youth suffrage appears to be gaining ground in Massachusetts; three of the four Democratic United States Senate candidates in 2010 supported lowering the voting age.\n\nIn 2013, the City of Takoma Park, Maryland became the first place in the United States to lower its voting age to 16, for local (but not general) elections and referendums. As of 2018, three additional cities have lowered the voting age to 16: Hyattsville and Greenbelt in Maryland, and Berkeley in California (for school board elections only). In 2018, a bill in the Council of the District of Columbia was proposed to lower the voting age to 16, which would make the federal district the first jurisdiction to lower the voting age for federal level elections.\n\nA request to lower the voting age to 16 was made during consideration of revisions to the Constitution of Venezuela in 2007. Cilia Flores, president of the National Assembly, announced that the Mixed Committee for Constitutional Reform had found the idea acceptable. Following approval in the legislature the amendment formed part of the package of constitutional proposals, and was defeated in the 2007 referendum.\n\nThere are occasional calls for a maximum voting age, on the grounds that older people have less of a stake in the future of the country or jurisdiction and tend to vote on the basis of self-interest.\n\nEighteen is the most common voting age, with a small minority of countries differing from this rule. Those with a national minimum age of 17 include East Timor, Greece, Indonesia, North Korea, South Sudan and Sudan. The minimum age is 16 in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey (three self-governing British Crown Dependencies). People aged 16–18 can vote in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro if employed. The highest minimum voting age is 21 in several nations. Some countries have variable provision for the minimum voting age, whereby a lower age is set for eligibility to vote in state, regional or municipal elections.\n\nThe only known maximum voting age is in the Holy See, where the franchise for electing a new Pope is restricted to Cardinals under the age of 80.\n\nThe following is an alphabetical list of voting ages in the various countries of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a chronological list of the dates upon which countries lowered the voting age to 18; unless otherwise indicated, the reduction was from 21. In some cases the age was lowered decrementally, and so the \"staging points\" are also given. Some information is also included on the relevant legal instruments involved.\n\n\nThis is a further list, similar to the above but of the dates upon which countries or territories lowered the voting age to 16; unless otherwise indicated, the reduction was from 18.\n\n\nThe following are political parties and other campaigning organisations that have either endorsed a lower voting age or who favour its removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the Constitutional Convention was asked to consider reducing the voting age to 17 and recommended lowering it to 16. The then government agreed to hold a referendum, but in 2015 postponed it indefinitely to give priority to other referendums.\n\n\nNo political party had decreed that its members should all follow the party line about lowering voting age policy, resulting in public differences of view. Most parties had splits in their members and supporters, taking different sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "248151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248151", "title": "Wexis", "text": "Wexis\n\nWexis is a humorous portmanteau used to refer to the alleged duopoly of publishing conglomerates that dominate the U.S. legal information services industry – namely, West Publishing and LexisNexis.\n\nNeither of these companies is independent – they are parts of much larger conglomerates that dominate the entire information services sector. West is owned by Thomson Reuters, while LexisNexis is a division of RELX Group.\n\nThese companies dispute the allegation that they are a duopoly; LexisNexis actually sued one company which used the terms \"Wexis\" and \"duopoly\" in its marketing literature.\n\nThe United States district court imposed various requirements regarding the companies' operations in a consent decree resulting from an antitrust inquiry by the United States Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in connection with Thomson's purchase of West Publishing, and West's and Lexis's settlement of various outstanding claims in that proceeding. For example, West was required to license the \"star pagination\" in its printed reporters under certain terms. Otherwise, lawyers in jurisdictions that require citations to all official and unofficial reporters would have to subscribe to \"both\" online services to get all the necessary page numbers for citations in their briefs. The judge also had concerns about the Thomson and West products ordered to be divested through a sale to Lexis, primarily statutory and case law publications of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, such as \"United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers Edition\" and \"United States Code Service\", but those sales were ultimately approved.\nBoth companies are known for their aggressive marketing programs in American law schools. Law students may print documents for free that are obtained through their respective services. Both companies also have programs through which students may earn points (based on their number of searches) that can be redeemed for free gifts.\n\nWolters Kluwer is the largest company which has attempted to establish a beachhead against the \"Wexis\" duopoly; it took over offline legal publishers like Aspen Publishing and online legal services like Loislaw (though it later sold the latter in 2015), and owns Commerce Clearing House (CCH). However, Wolters has not yet unified its online and offline legal offerings under a single brand (although it has gathered its existing brands under the umbrella of \"Wolters Kluwer Law and Business\"). Most importantly, Wolters lacks an automated cross-referencing or citation-checking service that can directly compete against Westlaw's KeyCite or Shepard's Citations from LexisNexis.\n\nThe Bureau of National Affairs is the best known of the remaining independent law publishing companies. Both BNA and CCH have arrangements with Lexis and Westlaw to publish their content though those electronic services, although they also provide their subscribers web access to certain publications.\n"}
