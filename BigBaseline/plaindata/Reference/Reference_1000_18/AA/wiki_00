{"id": "1171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1171", "title": "Abbreviation", "text": "Abbreviation\n\nAn abbreviation (from Latin \"brevis\", meaning \"short\" ) is a shortened form of a word or phrase. It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word \"abbreviation\" can itself be represented by the abbreviation \"abbr.\", \"abbrv.\", or \"abbrev.\"\n\nIn strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with contractions, crasis, acronyms, or initialisms, with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all four are connected by the term \"abbreviation\" in loose parlance.An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the Council of Science Editors). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.\n\nAbbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical Greece and Rome, the reduction of words to single letters was common. In Roman inscriptions, \"Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation.\" However, \"some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, \"A\" can be an abbreviation for many words, such as \"ager\", \"amicus\", \"annus\", \"as\", \"Aulus\", \"Aurelius\", \"aurum\" and \"avus\".)\"\n\nAbbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the old English poem \"Beowulf\" used many abbreviations, for example \"7\" or \"&\" for \"and\", and \"y\" for \"since\", so that \"not much space is wasted\". The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations. At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for \"master\" and ‹exacɔbate› for \"exacerbate\". While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:\n\nThe Early Modern English period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like \"y\" for \"Þ\", used for the word \"the\": \"hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe.\"\n\nDuring the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of J. R. R. Tolkien and his friend C. S. Lewis, and other members of the Oxford literary group known as the Inklings, are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this. Likewise, a century earlier in Boston, a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term OK generally credited as a remnant of its influence.\n\nAfter World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the full stop and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the \"Special Operations, Executive\"—\"S.O., E\"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.\n\nBut before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is \"not\" the last letter of its antecedent: \"M.\" is the abbreviation for \"monsieur\" while \"Mme\" is that for \"madame\". Like many other cross-channel linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.\n\nOver the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not personal computer (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.\n\nMinimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film ribbons since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.\n\nWidespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. SMS, for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the GSM 03.38 character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called Textese, with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated. More recently Twitter, a popular social networking service, began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.\n\nIn modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be \"consistent\", and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a style guide. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.\n\nIf the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for \"Leviticus\". When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for \"year-to-date\", PCB for \"printed circuit board\" and FYI for \"for your information\". However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.\n\nA period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.\n\nAccording to Hart's Rules, the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions. Fowler's Modern English Usage says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.\n\nIn American English, the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. \"Dr.\" or \"Mrs.\". In some cases, periods are optional, as in either \"US\" or \"U.S.\" for \"United States\", \"EU\" or \"E.U.\" for \"European Union\", and \"UN\" or \"U.N.\" for \"United Nations\". There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:\n\nAcronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are sonar, radar, lidar, laser, snafu, and scuba.\n\nToday, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters \"U. S.\"\n\nWhen an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: \"The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C\".\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\", while the Modern Language Association explicitly says, \"do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation\". Also, the American Psychological Association specifically says, \"without an apostrophe\".\n\nHowever, the 1999 style guide for \"The New York Times\" states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring \"PC's, TV's and VCR's\".\n\nFollowing those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of run batted in, simply add an s to the end of RBI.\n\n\nFor all other rules, see below:\n\nTo form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase \"s\" to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.\n\nTo indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.\n\nWhen an abbreviation contains more than one full point, \"Hart's Rules\" recommends putting the \"s\" after the final one.\nHowever, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:\n\nAccording to \"Hart's Rules\", an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.\nHowever, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:\n\nIn Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.\n\nPublications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" and the Associated Press. The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the U.S. Government Printing Office. The National Institute of Standards and Technology sets the style for abbreviations of units.\n\nMany British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:\n\n\nWriters often use shorthand to denote units of measure. Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as \"in\" for \"inch\" or can be a symbol such as \"km\" for \"kilometre/kilometer\".\n\nThe shorthand \"in\" applies to English only—in Afrikaans for example, the shorthand \"dm\" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word \"duim\". Since both \"in\" and \"dm\" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as \"Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process\" applies the appropriate shorthand by \"substitution\" rather than by \"contraction\". Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (\"\" in Portuguese or \"\" in Greek) is \"km\" in both languages and the letter \"k\" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, \"km\" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a logogram rather than an abbreviation.\n\nIn the International System of Units (SI) manual the word \"symbol\" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also defines the way in which units should be written, the principal rules being:\n\nA syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as \"Interpol\" = International\" + police\". It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case, sometimes starting with a capital letter, and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as Ofcom (Office of Communications\") and Oftel (Office of Telecommunications\") use this style.\n\nNew York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as Tribeca (Triangle below Canal Street\") and SoHo (South of Houston Street\"). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving SoMa, San Francisco (South of Market\") and LoDo, Denver (Lower Downtown\"), among others.\n\nOn the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the Nazis and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, \"Gestapo\" stands for Geheime Staats-Polizei\", or \"secret state police\". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the \"Comintern\" (\"Communist International\") and \"Komsomol\" (Kommunisticheskii Soyuz Molodyozhi\", or \"Communist youth union\") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries, (as in Orwell's Newspeak), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., \"\" for \"Schutzpolizei\", and are still used, e.g. \"\" for \"\".\n\nIn the modern Russian language words like \"Minoborony\" (from Ministerstvo oborony — Ministry of Defence) and \"Minobrnauki\" (from Ministerstvo obrazovaniya i nauki — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations were also typical for the German language used in the German Democratic Republic, e.g. \"Stasi\" for Staatssicherheit\" (\"state security\", the secret police) or \"Vopo\" for \"Volkspolizist\" (\"people's policeman\"). Other uses are in company or product names such as Aldi, from the name of the founder, Theo Albrecht, and the German word Diskont\" (discount) or Haribo, from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, Hans Riegl Bonn.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are \"de rigueur\" in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as Pemex for Petróleos Mexicanos\" (\"Mexican Petroleums\") or Fonafifo for Fondo Nacional de Financimiento Forestal\" (National Forestry Financing Fund).\n\nEast Asian languages whose writing systems use Chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase. For example, in Japanese the term for the United Nations, \"kokusai rengō\" (国際連合) is often abbreviated to \"kokuren\" (国連). (Such abbreviations are called (略語) in Japanese; see also Japanese abbreviated and contracted words). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, \"Běidà\" (北大) for \"Běijīng Dàxué\" (北京大学, Peking University) and \"Tōdai\" (東大) for \"Tōkyō daigaku\" (東京大学, University of Tokyo). The English phrase \"Gung ho\" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.\n\nPartially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence \"DESRON 6\" is used (in the full capital form) to mean \"Destroyer Squadron 6\", while \"COMNAVAIRLANT\" would be \"Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic.\"\n\n"}

Abbreviations of the first kind are like most abbreviations in language; they consist for the most part of the initial letter or first syllable of the word employed—as for instance, or for the dynamic markings piano and forte, \"cresc.\" for crescendo, \"Ob.\" for oboe, \"Fag.\" for bassoon (). This article is about abbreviations used in music notation. For abbreviations of terms related to musical expression and music in general, see Glossary of musical terminology.\n\nThe continued repetition of a note or chord is expressed by a stroke or strokes across the stem, or above or below the note if it be a whole note or double whole note. The number of strokes denotes the subdivision of the written note into eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., unless the word tremolo or tremolando is added, in which case the repetition is as rapid as possible, without regard to the exact number of notes played. (When strokes are added to notes shorter than a quarter note, each beam counts as a stroke.) In the first bar of the example below, the half note with the single stroke across the stem in the \"written\" staff becomes 4 eighth notes in the \"played\" staff. Through the use of 2 strokes across the stem in the second bar, the next full note is expressed as a phrase of 16 sixteenth notes.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\new staff { c2:8^\\markup { Written: } <e c g>: | c1:16 | \\time 2/4 f,2:32 | \\time 4/4 f4:8 a:8 c:16 f:16 | b,8:16 d:16 b:16 g:16 a:32 b:32 c:32 d:32 \\bar \"|.\" } \\new staff { c8^\\markup { Played: } c c c <e c g> <e c g> <e c g> <e c g> | c16 c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c | f,32 f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f | f8 f a a c16 c c c f f f f | b, b d d b b g g a32 a a a b b b b c c c c d d d d } »\n</score>\n\nOn bowed instruments the rapid reiteration of a single note is easy, but in piano music an octave or chord becomes necessary to produce a tremolo, the manner of writing and performing of which is seen below.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 2/4 \\new staff { <g g'>4:16 ^\\markup { \\italic tremolo } <e' c g>:16 | \\repeat tremolo 4 { <c e>16^\\markup { \\italic tremolo } g } | s4 } \\new staff { g'32*8/12 g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, <c e>32*8/12 g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g | <c e>32 g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nIn the abbreviation expressed by strokes, as above, the passage to be abbreviated can contain no note of greater length than an eighth note, but it is possible also to divide a long note into quarter notes, by means of dots (sometimes known as \"divisi\" dots) placed over it, as below.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { c2^\\markup { .. } c2^\\markup { .. } | c1^\\markup { ... } | s2 } \\new staff { c4 c c c | c c c c | s2 } »\n</score>\n\nThis is however seldom done, as only a small amount of space is saved. When a long note has to be repeated in the form of triplets or sextuplets, the figure 3 or 6 is usually placed over it in addition to the stroke across the stem, and the note is sometimes, though not necessarily, written dotted.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { c4:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } c4:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } c2:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 6 } } \\bar \"||\" \\time 4/4 \\omit TupletNumber \\tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } } \\tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } } \\tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 6 } } } \\tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 6 } } } \\bar \"||\" } \\new staff { \\tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c c c c c c c} | \\tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c} \\tuplet 6/4 4 {c16 c c c c c c c c c c c} } »\n</score>\n\nThe repetition of a group of two notes is abbreviated by two notes (most often half notes or whole notes) connected by the number of strokes ordinarily used to express eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., according to the rate of movement intended, as below. It will be observed that a passage lasting for the value of one half note requires two half notes to express it, on account of the group consisting of two notes.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { \\repeat tremolo 2 { f8 a } \\repeat tremolo 4 { f16 a} | \\repeat tremolo 4 { f8 a } | s4 } \\new staff { f8 a f a f16 a f a f a f a | f8 a f a f a f a | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nAs seen above, half notes are often written with the strokes beaming the notes together (which is unambiguous as white notes with beams are not otherwise used in music), but with quarter notes and shorter the strokes must be separated from the stems to prevent them being misread as a shorter note value.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 2/4 \\new staff { \\repeat tremolo 4 { c32 a } \\repeat tremolo 4 { g64 c } \\repeat tremolo 4 { g64 b } | s4 } \\new staff { c32 a c a c a c a g64 [c g c g c g c] g [b g b g b g b] | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nA group of three, four, or more notes is abbreviated by the repetition of the cross strokes without the notes as many times as the group has to be repeated.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { \\repeat percent 2 { e8[ g c g] } | \\repeat percent 4 { e16 g c g } \\bar \"||\" } \\new staff { e8 g c g e g c g | e16 g c g e g c g e g c g e g c g } »\n</score>\n\nThis can also be written with the notes forming the group are written as a chord, with the necessary number of strokes across the stem. In this case the word \"simili\" or \"segue\" is added, to show that the order of notes in the first group (which must be written out in full) is to be repeated, and to prevent the possibility of mistaking the effect intended for the repetition of the chord as a whole.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { d16 f a f <d f a>2.:16^\\markup { \\italic simili } | s4 } \\new staff { d16 f a f d f a f d f a f d f a f | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nAnother sign of abbreviation of a group consists of an oblique line with two dots, one on each side; this serves to indicate the repetition of a group of any number of notes of any length. This can even apply to a passage composed of several groups, provided such passage is not more than two bars in length.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { \\repeat percent 2 { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } \\bar \"||\" } \\new staff { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f | e g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } »\n</score>\n\nA more usual method of abbreviating the repetition of a passage of the length of the above is to write over it the word \"bis\" (twice), or in some cases \"ter\" (three times), or to enclose it between the dots of an ordinary repeat sign.\n\nPassages intended to be played in octaves are often written as single notes with the words \"coll' ottava\" or \"coll' 8va\" placed above or below them, according as the upper or lower octave is to be added.\n\n« { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 2/4 \\new Staff { c\"8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic \"coll' 8\" \\super \\italic \"va\" } } d\" e\" f\" \\bar \"||\" \\clef bass g_\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic \"coll' 8\" \\super \\italic \"va\" } } e c4 \\bar \"||\" s4 } \\new Staff { <c\" c>8 <d\" d> <e\" e> <f\" f> | \\clef bass <g g,> <e e,> <c c,>4 | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nThe word \"8\" (or sometimes \"8 alta\" or \"8 bassa\") written above or below a passage does not add octaves, but merely transposes the passage an octave higher or lower. In clarinet music the word \"chalumeau\" is used to signify that the passage is to be played an octave lower than written.\n\n« { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new Staff { \\ottava #1 f8 e d c \\ottava #0 b\"^\\markup { \\smaller \\italic loco } a\" g\"4 \\bar \"||\" \\clef bass \\ottava #-1 a,8 b, c, d, \\ottava #0 e_\\markup { \\smaller \\italic loco } f g4 \\bar \"||\" \\clef treble \\ottava #-1 \\set Staff.ottavation = #\"chalumeau\" e8 g c' g f a c' a | g \\ottava #0 e'_\\markup { \\smaller \\italic clar. } g' c\" e\"2 \\bar \"||\" } \\new Staff { f8 e d c b\" a\" g\"4 | \\clef bass a,8 b, c, d, e, f, g,4 | \\clef treble e8 g c' g f a c' a | g e' g' c\" e\"2 } »\n</score>\n\nAll these alterations (which can scarcely be considered abbreviations except that they spare the use of ledger lines) are counteracted, and the passage restored to its usual position, by the ending of the enclosing bracket, the word \"loco\", or in clarinet music \"clarinette\".\n\nIn orchestral music it often happens that certain of the instruments play in unison; when this is the case the parts are sometimes not all written in the score, but the lines belonging to one or more of the instruments are left blank, and the words \"coi violini\" or \"col basso\", etc., are added, to indicate that the instruments in question have to play in unison with the violins or basses, as the case may be, or when two instruments of the same kind, such as first and second violins, have to play in unison, the word \"unisono\" or \"col primo\" is placed instead of the notes in the line belonging to the second. Where two parts are written on one staff in a score the sign \"a 2\" denotes that both play the same notes; and \"a 1\" that the second of the two is resting. The indication \"a 3\" or \"a 4\" at the head of fugues indicates the number of parts or voices in which the fugue is written.\n\nAn abbreviation which is often very troublesome to the conductor occurs in manuscript scores, when a considerable part of the composition is repeated without alteration, and the corresponding number of bars are left vacant, with the remark \"come sopra\" (as above). This is not met with in printed scores.\n\nThere are also abbreviations relating to music analysis, some of which are of great value. In figured bass, for instance, the various chords are expressed by figures, and the several authors in the nineteenth century invented or availed themselves of various methods of shortly expressing the different chords and intervals, particularly using Roman numeral analysis.\n\nGottfried Weber represents an interval by a number with one or two dots before it to express minor or diminished, and one or two after it for major or augmented.\n\nJohann Anton André makes use of a right triangle to express a triad, and a square, for a seventh chord, the inversions being indicated by one, two, or three small vertical lines across their base, and the classification into major, minor, diminished, or augmented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4, placed in the centre.\n"}
{"id": "1052571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052571", "title": "Acronym", "text": "Acronym\n\nAn acronym is a word or name formed as an abbreviation from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in \"NATO\" or \"laser\") and sometimes syllables (as in \"Benelux\").\n\nThere are no universal standards for the multiple names for such abbreviations or for their orthographic styling. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending.\n\nWhereas an abbreviation may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, \"Rd\" for \"road\" or \"Dr\" for \"Doctor\"), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as \"sonar\", created from \"und vigation and anging\"). Attestations for \"\" in German are known from 1921, and for \"acronym\" in English from 1940.\n\nAlthough the word \"acronym\" is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters, some dictionaries and usage commentators define \"acronym\" to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word, in contrast to an initialism (or alphabetism)an abbreviation formed from a string of initials (and possibly pronounced as individual letters).\nSome dictionaries include additional senses equating \"acronym\" with \"initialism\". The distinction, when made, hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters. Examples in reference works that make the distinction include \"NATO\" , \"scuba\" , and \"radar\" for acronyms; and \"FBI\" , \"CRT\" , and \"HTML\" for initialisms. The rest of this article uses \"acronym\" for both types of abbreviation.\n\nThe distinction is not well-maintained. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\": \"A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... \"Initialism\", an older word than \"acronym\", seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with \"acronym\" in a narrow sense.\" About the use of \"acronym\" to only mean those pronounced as words, \"Fowler's Modern English Usage\" (3rd ed.) states: \"The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, \"acronym\" is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called \"initialisms\".\"\n\nA clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles & Algeo (1970), who divided \"acronyms\" as a general category into \"word acronyms\" pronounced as words, and \"initialisms\" sounded out as letters.\n\nThere is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as \"JPEG\" and \"MS-DOS\" . There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms \"URL\" and \"IRA\" can be pronounced as individual letters: and , respectively; or as a single word: and , respectively.\nThe spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism (that is, what it stands for) is called its \"expansion\".\n\n\nAcronymy, like retronymy, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no naming, conscious attention, or systematic analysis until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.\n\nAncient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was metalanguage at the time to describe it) include the following:\n\nDuring the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating corporation names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of railroad cars (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on ticker tape and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include Nabisco (National Biscuit Company), Esso (from S.O., from Standard Oil), and Sunoco (Sun Oil Company).\n\nAnother driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the American Civil War (acronyms such as ANV for \"Army of Northern Virginia\" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in World War I and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during World War II, who themselves were referred to as G.I.s.\n\nThe widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") records the first printed use of the word \"initialism\" as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after \"acronym\" had become common.\n\nBy 1943, the term \"acronym\" had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words. (It was formed from the Greek words , ', \"topmost, extreme\" and , ', \"name.\") For example, the army offense of being \"absent without official leave\" was abbreviated to \"A.W.O.L.\" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (\"awol\"), it became an acronym. While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was \"a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words\", for example UNIVAC from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.\n\nIn English, acronyms \"pronounced as words\" may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in \"Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends\" claims that \"forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is \"colinderies\" or \"colinda\", an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year.\" However, although acronymic words seem not to have been \"employed in general vocabulary\" before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the \"concept of their formation\" is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, \"How to Write a Blackwood Article\", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.\n\nThe use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in vernaculars has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:\n\n\nThe earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the \"OED\" is \"abjud\" (now \"abjad\"), formed from the original first four letters of the Arabic alphabet in the late 18th century. Some acrostics predate this, however, such as the Restoration witticism arranging the names of some members of Charles II's Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the \"CABAL\" ministry.\n\nAcronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The armed forces and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the \"alphabet agencies\" (also jokingly referred to as \"alphabet soup\") created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (also of course known as FDR) under the New Deal. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names. One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for \"commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific\"; it's also seen as \"ComCruDesPac\". \"YABA-compatible\" (where YABA stands for \"yet another bloody acronym\") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., \"When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'.\"\n\nAcronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as \"GF\" (girlfriend), \"LOL\" (laughing out loud), and \"DL\" (download or down low) have become popular. Some prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use \"pure\" or \"proper\" English. Others point out that language change has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in \"proper\" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper column inches).\n\nIn formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a common noun such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a proper noun such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at Case > Casing of expansions).\n\nIn addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).\n\nExpansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips, hyperlinks, and rapid search via search engine technology.\n\nAcronyms often occur in jargon. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.\n\nThe medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.\nAcronyms are often taught as mnemonic devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are ROY G. BIV (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: GUMPS, which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include CAN SLIM, and PAVPANIC as well as PEMDAS.\n\nIt is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of false etymology, called a \"folk etymology\", for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics, and are examples of language-related urban legends. For example, \"cop\" is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from \"constable on patrol,\" and \"posh\" from \"port out, starboard home\". With some of these specious expansions, the \"belief\" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been tongue-in-cheek among many citers, as with \"gentlemen only, ladies forbidden\" for \"golf\", although many other (more credulous) people have uncritically taken it for fact. Taboo words in particular commonly have such false etymologies: \"shit\" from \"ship/store high in transit\" or \"special high-intensity training\" and \"fuck\" from \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\", or \"fornication under consent/command of the king\".\n\nIn English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a full stop/period/point in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the colon and apostrophe have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. \"A. D.\"). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.\n\nSome influential style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of \"The Penguin Guide to Punctuation\", states categorically that, in British English, \"this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete\".\n\nNevertheless, some influential style guides, many of them American, still require periods in certain instances. For example, The New York Times' guide recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in \"K.G.B.\", but not when pronounced as a word, as in \"NATO\". The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.\n\nWhen a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. \"TV\", for example, may stand for a \"single\" word (\"television\" or \"transvestite\", for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although \"PS\" stands for the single word \"postscript\" (or the Latin \"postscriptum\"), it is often spelled with periods (\"P.S.\").\n\nThe slash ('/', or \"solidus\") is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in \"N/A\" (\"not applicable, not available\"), \"c/o\" (\"care of\") and \"w/o\" (\"without\").\n\nInconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, \"i18n\" abbreviates \"internationalization\", a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The \"18\" represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in \"internationalization\". \"Localization\" can be abbreviated \"l10n\", \"multilingualization\" \"m17n\", and \"accessibility\" \"a11y\". In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general \"x\" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include \"Crxn\" for \"crystallization\" and the series familiar to physicians for history, diagnosis, and treatment (\"hx\", \"dx\", \"tx\").\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\". The Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so \"compact discs\" would be \"CDs\" or \"C.D.s\"), whereas \"The New York Times\" style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring \"PC's, TV's and VCR's\").\n\nPossessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, \"the C.D.'s' labels\" (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is \"S\", as in \"SOS's\" (although abbreviations ending with S can also take \"-es\", e.g. \"SOSes\"), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.\n\nA particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is \"Member of Parliament\", which in plural is \"Members of Parliament\". It is possible then to abbreviate this as \"M's P.\" (or similar), as used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley. This usage is less common than forms with \"s\" at the end, such as \"MPs\", and may appear dated or pedantic. In common usage, therefore, \"weapons of mass destruction\" becomes \"WMDs\", \"prisoners of war\" becomes \"POWs\", and \"runs batted in\" becomes \"RBIs\".\n\nThe argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, \"If \"D\" can stand for \"disc\", it can also stand for \"discs\") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, \"U.S.\" is short for \"United States, but not \"United State\". In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final \"s\" may seem awkward: for example, \"U.S.\", \"U.S.'s\", etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple attributive usage (for example, \"the U.S. economy\") or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and \"then\" making the possessive (for example, \"the United States' economy\"). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation \"United States's\" sometimes is used.\n\nAbbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as \"TV\" (\"television\")—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (\"two TVs\"); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (\"the TV's antenna\").\n\nThe most common capitalization scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase (all-caps), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words \"scuba\", \"laser\", and \"radar\"—these are known as \"anacronyms\". Anacronyms (note well \"-acro-\") should not be homophonously confused with anachronyms (note well \"-chron-\"), which are a type of misnomer.\n\nSmall caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and \"USA Today\", is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters; thus \"U.S.\" and \"FDR\" in normal caps, but \"\" in small caps. The acronyms \"AD\" and \"BC\" are often smallcapped as well, as in: \"From \".\n\nWords derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, \"pre-WWII politics\", \"post-NATO world\", \"DNAase\". In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, messenger RNA and transfer RNA become mRNA and tRNA.\n\nSome publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms \"Nato\" and \"Aids\" in mixed case, but the initialisms \"USA\" and \"FBI\" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in \"The Guardian\", and BBC News typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.\n\nSome style manuals also base the letters' case on their number. \"The New York Times\", for example, keeps \"NATO\" in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it \"Nato\"), but uses lower case in \"UNICEF\" (from \"United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of \"shouting capitals\").\n\nWhile abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short function words (such as \"and\", \"or\", \"of\", or \"to\"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in headers and publication titles.) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL (Transport for London) and \"LotR\" (\"Lord of the Rings\"); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.\n\nNumbers (both cardinal and ordinal) in names are often represented by digits rather than initial letters: as in \"4GL\" (Fourth generation language) or \"G77\" (Group of 77). Large numbers may use metric prefixes, as with \"Y2K\" for \"Year 2000\" (sometimes written \"Y2k\", because the SI symbol for 1000 is \"k\"—not \"K\", which stands for \"kelvin\"). Exceptions using initials for numbers include \"TLA\" (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and \"GoF\" (Gang of Four). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as \"W3C\" (\"World Wide Web Consortium\") and \"T3\" (\"Trends, Tips & Tools for Everyday Living\"); pronunciation, such as \"B2B\" (\"business to business\"); and numeronyms, such as \"i18n\" (\"internationalization\"; \"18\" represents the 18 letters between the initial \"i\" and the final \"n\").\n\nAlthough many authors of expository writing show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for proper nouns. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography. Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters. For example,\n\"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)\" or \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" in the final published article when following the AMA Manual of Style.\n\nSome apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such pseudo-acronyms may be pronunciation-based, such as BBQ (bee-bee-cue), for \"barbecue\", or K9 (kay-nine) for \"canine\". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as \"orphan initialisms\"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning. For example, the letters of the SAT, a US college entrance test originally dubbed \"Scholastic Aptitude Test\", no longer officially stand for anything.\n\nThis is common with companies that want to retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT&T, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.\n\nPseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets: for example, some national affiliates of International Business Machines are legally incorporated as \"IBM\" (for example, \"IBM Canada\") to avoid translating the full name into local languages. Likewise, \"UBS\" is the name of the merged Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, and \"HSBC\" has replaced \"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\" Sometimes, companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, Toronto-Dominion Bank continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as TD Bank, just as Royal Bank of Canada used its full name in Canada (a constitutional monarchy), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called RBC Bank.\n\nRebranding can lead to redundant acronym syndrome, as when Trustee Savings Bank became TSB Bank, or when Railway Express Agency became REA Express. A few high-tech companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd. Examples in entertainment include the television shows \"\" and \"Navy: NCIS\" (\"Navy\" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for. The same reasoning was in evidence when the Royal Bank of Canada's Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank, or when Bank of Montreal rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.\n\nAnother common example is \"RAM memory\", which is redundant because \"RAM\" (\"random-access memory\") includes the initial of the word \"memory\". \"PIN\" stands for \"personal identification number\", obviating the second word in \"PIN number\"; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word \"pin\". Other examples include \"ATM machine,\" \"EAB bank,\" \"CableACE Award,\" \"DC Comics,\" \"HIV virus,\" Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant \"SAT test,\" now simply \"SAT Reasoning Test\"). TNN (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself \"The New TNN\" for a brief interlude.\n\nSometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:\n\nA \"backronym\" (or \"bacronym\") is a phrase that is constructed \"after the fact\" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word \"book\" ought to stand for \"Box Of Organized Knowledge.\" A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The Apple Lisa, which was said to refer to \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.\n\nBackronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) \"A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men\".\n\nAcronyms are sometimes contrived, that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are \"USA PATRIOT\", \"CAN SPAM\", \"CAPTCHA\" and \"ACT UP\". The clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as \"fcuk\", standing for \"French Connection United Kingdom.\" The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word \"fuck.\"\n\nThe US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including \"RESURRECT\", \"NIRVANA\", and \"DUDE\". In July 2010, Wired Magazine reported that DARPA announced programs to \"..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science\" named \"BATMAN\" and \"ROBIN\" for \"Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature\" and \"Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks\", a reference to the Batman and Robin comic-book superheroes.\n\nThe short-form names of clinical trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the archetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the raison d'être of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of \"cutesy\" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a cryptic and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).\n\nSome acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, \"Verliebt in Berlin\" (ViB), a German telenovela, was first intended to be \"Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)\", but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym \"ANAL\". Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as \"CLaIT\", rather than \"CLIT\". In Canada, the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party) was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced \"see crap\"). (The satirical magazine \"Frank\" had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and NSDAP.) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology (TIT). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology (GIT). The charity sports organization Team in Training is known as \"TNT\" and not \"TIT\". Technological Institute of Textile & Sciences is still known as TITS. George Mason University was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law (ASSOL) in honor of the late Antonin Scalia, only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.\n\nA macronym, or nested acronym, is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word \"macronym\" is a portmanteau of \"macro-\" and \"acronym\".\n\nSome examples of macronyms are: \n\nSome macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine \"New Scientist\", a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the \"Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service\"; ATOVS is \"Advanced TOVS\"; TOVS is \"TIROS operational vertical sounder\"; and TIROS is \"Television infrared observational satellite\". Fully expanded, \"RARS\" might thus become \"Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service\". However, to say that \"RARS\" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax (in the same way that \"CHF\" can be usefully interchanged with \"congestive heart failure\"), is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to \"spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations,\" but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words \"laser\" and \"radar\" function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as \"RARS\" and \"CHA2DS2–VASc score\" are irreducible in natural language; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively, includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain, which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from \"Podospora anserine\"), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners.\n\nA special type of macronym, the recursive acronym, has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in \"The Hacker's Dictionary\" as MUNG, which stands for \"MUNG Until No Good\".\n\nSome examples of recursive acronyms are:\n\nIn English language discussions of languages with syllabic or logographic writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), \"acronyms\" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.\n\nFor example, in Chinese, \"university\" (/, literally \"great learning\") is usually abbreviated simply as (\"great\") when used with the name of the institute. So \"Peking University\" () is commonly shortened to ( \"north-great\") by also only taking the first character of \"Peking\", the \"northern capital\" (). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of \"Hong Kong University\" () uses \"Kong\" () rather than \"Hong\".\n\nThere are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), is \"Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the \"Communist Party of China\" part of its name through acronyms, then the \"Standing Committee\" part, again through acronyms, to create \"中共中央政治局常委\". Alternatively, it omitted the \"Communist Party\" part altogether, creating \"Politburo Standing Committee\" (政治局常委会), and eventually just \"Standing Committee\" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are \"Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply \"Changwei\" (常委), with the term \"Ruchang\" (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word \"全国人民代表大会\" (National People's Congress) can be broken into four parts: \"全国\" = \"the whole nation\", \"人民\" = \"people\", \"代表\" = \"representatives\", \"大会\" = \"conference\". Yet, in its short form \"人大\" (literally \"man/people big\"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part (\"全国\") and the third part (\"代表\") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term \"initialism\" is inapplicable.\n\nMany proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the CCTV New Year's Gala, whose full name is literally read as \"China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to \"Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply \"Chunwan\" (春晚). Along the same vein, \"Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai\" (中国中央电视台) was reduced to \"Yangshi\" (央视) in the mid-2000s.\n\nMany aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for \"big\" or \"great\" i.e. \"dae\" (), to refer to universities (; \"daehak,\" literally \"great learning\" although \"big school\" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as \"UPenn\" or \"Texas Tech.\"\n\nSome acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how Hongik University (, \"Hongik Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Hongdae\" (, \"Hong, the big [school]\" or \"Hong-U\") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. Korea National University of Education (, \"Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Gyowondae\" (교원대, \"Big Ed.\" or \"Ed.-U\"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (, \"Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon\") is referred to as KAIST (, \"Kaiseuteu\") in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, \"seukai\"), combining the first letter of their English names (Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test (, \"Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom\") is shortened to \"Suneung\" (, \"S.A.\").\n\nThe Japanese language makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.\n\nChinese-based words (Sino-Japanese vocabulary) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like for . In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in Saikyō for 埼京, from , rather than Saitō.\n\nNon-Chinese foreign borrowings (gairaigo) are instead frequently abbreviated as clipped compounds, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in katakana transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in hiragana). For example, the \"Pokémon\" media franchise's name originally stood for \"pocket monsters\" ( → ), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and \"wāpuro\" stands for \"word processor\" ( → ).\n\nTo a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are \"Gestapo\" rather than \"GSP\" (for ', 'secret state police'); ' rather than \"FAK\" (for ', anti-aircraft gun); ' rather than \"KP\" (for ', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ' (for ', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of include ' (for ', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a mullet) and the mocking of Adolf Hitler's title as ' (\"\", Greatest General of all Times).\n\nIt is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign gershayim is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word. Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): (for , the United States); (for , the Soviet Union); (for , Rishon LeZion); (for , the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is (\"Tzahal\", for , Israel Defense Forces). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign gershayim remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\", singular: , plural: ; \"squad commander\", masculine: , feminine: ).\n\nThere is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life. For example, the \"Golkar\" political party stands for Partai \"Gol\"ongan \"Kar\"ya, \"Monas\" stands for \"\"Mo\"numen \"Nas\"ional\" (National Monument), the \"Angkot\" public transport stands for \"\"Ang\"kutan \"Kot\"a\" (city public transportation), \"warnet\" stands for \"\"war\"ung inter\"net\"\" (internet cafe), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, slang or colloquial.\n\nThe capital's metropolitan area (Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions), \"Jabodetabek\", is another infamous acronym. This stands for \"Ja\"karta-\"Bo\"gor-\"De\"pok-\"Ta\"ngerang-\"Bek\"asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. \"Jalan Tol\" (Toll Road) \"Jagorawi\" (\"Ja\"karta-Bo\"gor\"-Ci\"awi\") and \"Purbaleunyi\" (\"Pur\"wakarta-\"Ba\"ndung-Ci\"leunyi\"), Joglo Semar (\"Jog\"ja-so\"lo\"-\"semar\"ang).\n\nIn some languages, especially those that use certain alphabets, many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The Indonesian military (TNI—\"Tentara Nasional Indonesia\") and Indonesian police (POLRI—\"Kepolisian Republik Indonesia\") are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the \"Kopassus\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan Khu\"sus\"; Special Forces Command), \"Kopaska\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan \"Ka\"tak; Frogmen Command), \"Kodim\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Di\"strik \"M\"iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's administrative divisions), \"Serka\" (\"Ser\"san \"K\"ep\"a\"la; Head Sergeant), \"Akmil\" (\"Ak\"ademi \"Mil\"iter; Military Academy—in Magelang) and many other terms regarding ranks, units, divisions, procedures, etc.\n\nHeavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of Bahasa Indonesia to seek information and news in Indonesian media.\n\nAcronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. (Gazprom), for (', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (\"SMI\", for ', means of mass informing, i.e. mass media). Another Russian acronym, (GULag) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for (\", Chief Administration of Camps).\n\nHistorically, OTMA was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.\n\nIn Swahili, acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for \" (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.\n\nIn Vietnamese, which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include \"TP.HCM\" (', Ho Chi Minh City), \"THPT\" (', high school), \"CLB\" (', club), \"CSDL\" (', database), \"NXB\" (', publisher), \"ÔBACE\" (', a general form of address), and \"CTTĐVN\" (', Vietnamese Martyrs). Longer examples include \"CHXHCNVN\" (', Socialist Republic of Vietnam) and \"MTDTGPMNVN\" (\"\", Viet Cong). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in Vietnam. It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.\n\nEach letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example \"ĐNA\" or \"ĐNÁ\" for \"\" (Southeast Asia) and \"LMCA\" or \"LMCÂ\" for \"Liên minh châu Âu\" (European Union). The letter \"Ư\" is often replaced by \"W\" in initialisms to avoid confusion with \"U\", for example \"UBTWMTTQVN\" or \"UBTƯMTTQVN\" for \"Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam\" (Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front).\n\nInitialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the names of many Vietnamese letters are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ' (), a respelling of the French acronym \"SIDA\" (AIDS); ' (), a literal reading of the English initialism for Voice of America; and \"NASA\" (), borrowed directly from the English acronym.\n\nAs in Chinese, many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term Việt Cộng is derived from the first syllables of \"Việt Nam\" (Vietnam) and \"Cộng sản\" (communist). This mechanism is limited to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered portmanteau words or blend words rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the Vietnamese alphabet still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.\n\nIn languages where nouns are declined, various methods are used. An example is Finnish, where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:\nThe process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus \"pre-NATO policy\" (rather than \"preNATO\").\n\nIn languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Irish, where lenition (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case \"h\" is added after the initial consonant; for example, \"BBC Scotland\" in the genitive case would be written as \"BhBC Alba\", with the acronym pronounced \"VBC\". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for \"television\" (\"gd: telebhisean\") is \"TBh\", pronounced \"TV\", as in English.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46842956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46842956", "title": "Bekker numbering", "text": "Bekker numbering\n\nBekker numbering or Bekker pagination is the standard form of citation to the works of Aristotle. It is based on the page numbers used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences edition of the complete works of Aristotle and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical philologist August Immanuel Bekker (1785-1871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name Berlin numbering or Berlin pagination.\n\nBekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition). For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is \"1094a1\", which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1.\n\nAll modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers. Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.\n\nWhile Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, Catholic or Thomist scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.\n\nStephanus pagination is the comparable system for referring to the works of Plato, and Diels-Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the \"Corpus Aristotelicum\" regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.\n\nThe following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation. Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.\n\nThe \"Constitution of the Athenians\" (or \"Athenaiōn Politeia\") was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the British Museum. The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.\n\nSurviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by Valentin Rose. These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of Aristotle was \"Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus\" (1863). As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the Teubner series, \"Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta\", Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by \"R\"), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in Walter de Gruyter's reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by Eckart Schütrumpf is in preparation.\n\nFor a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, \"Select Fragments\" (Oxford 1952), and Jonathan Barnes (ed.), \"The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation\", vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp. 2384–2465.\n\nThe works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues \"On Philosophy\" (or \"On the Good\"), \"Eudemus\" (or \"On the Soul\"), \"On Justice\", and \"On Good Birth\". The possibly spurious work, \"On Ideas\" survives in quotations by Alexander of Aphrodisias in his commentary on Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\". For the dialogues, see also the editions of Richard Rudolf Walzer, \"Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum\" (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, \"Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi\" (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.\n\n"}
{"id": "1047161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1047161", "title": "Chapters and verses of the Bible", "text": "Chapters and verses of the Bible\n\nThe Bible is a compilation of many shorter books written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the biblical canon. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into chapters, generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses - each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of , and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of .\n\nAs the chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts, they form part of the paratext of the Bible.\n\nThe Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians. For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many Psalms are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered. Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have where Christian translations have .\n\nEarly manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers. In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs (parashot) that were identified by two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Peh פ indicated an \"open\" paragraph that began on a new line, while Samekh ס indicated a \"closed\" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space. These two letters begin the Hebrew words open (patuach\") and closed (sagoor\"), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the Book of Isaiah from the Dead Sea Scrolls used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the Masoretic divisions. (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as acrostics, such as several of the Psalms and most of the Book of Lamentations.)\n\nThe Hebrew Bible was also divided into some larger sections. In Israel the Torah (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections (Parashat ha-Shavua) so it could be read through in one year. The New Testament was divided into topical sections known as \"kephalaia\" by the fourth century. Eusebius of Caesarea divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or \"canons\". Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions. (See fuller discussions below.)\n\nChapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.\n\nArchbishop Stephen Langton and Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.\n\nWhile chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them. Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include John Locke's \"Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul\" (1707), Alexander Campbell's \"The Sacred Writings\" (1826), Daniel Berkeley Updike’s fourteen-volume \"The Holy Bible Containing the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha,\" Richard Moulton's \"The Modern Reader's Bible\" (1907), Ernest Sutherland Bates's \"The Bible Designed to Be Read as Living Literature\" (1936), \"The Books of the Bible\" (2007) from the International Bible Society (Biblica), Adam Lewis Greene’s five-volume \"Bibliotheca\" (2014), and the six-volume ESV Reader's Bible (2016) from Crossway Books.\n\nSince at least 916 the Tanakh has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in Masoretic vocalization and cantillation markings. One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the \"sof passuq\", symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the colon (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the Bible into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus's work for the first Hebrew Bible concordance around 1440.\n\nThe first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar Santi Pagnini (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted. His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today. Robert Estienne created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.\n\nThe first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by William Whittingham (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the Geneva Bible published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages. (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is \"The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language\" by Eugene H. Peterson.)\n\nThe Hebrew Masoretic text of the Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:\n\nMost important are the verse endings. According to the Talmudic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin. In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a \"silluq\" (which means \"stop\"). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a \"silluq\".\n\nThe Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called \"parashot\", which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a \"closed\" section) or a new line beginning (an \"open\" section). The division of the text reflected in the \"parashot\" is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the \"parashot\" are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.\n\nIn early manuscripts (most importantly in Tiberian Masoretic manuscripts, such as the Aleppo codex), an \"open\" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a \"closed\" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed Hebrew Bibles. In this system, the one rule differentiating \"open\" and \"closed\" sections is that \"open\" sections must \"always\" start at the beginning of a new line, while \"closed\" sections \"never\" start at the beginning of a new line.\n\nAnother division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the \"sedarim\". This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the \"quantity\" of text. For the Torah, this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.\n\nThe Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called \"kephalaia\" (singular \"kephalaion\", literally meaning \"heading\"). This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one \"kephalaion\" mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next. For example, the Sermon on the Mount, comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one \"kephalaion\" mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the Gospel of Matthew has several, one per miracle. Moreover, there were far fewer \"kephalaia\" in the Gospel of John than in the Gospel of Mark, even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the \"kephalaia\" with their numbers, their standard titles (\"titloi\") and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself.\n\nThe titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some \"kephalaia\" are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next \"kephalaion\" begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the Daughter of Jairus and of the healing of the woman with a haemorrhage gets two marked \"kephalaia\", one titled \"of the daughter of the synagogue ruler\" at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled \"of the woman with the flow of blood\" where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous \"kephalaion\" is thus properly concluded). Thus the \"kephalaia\" marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions.\n\nCardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro is often given credit for first dividing the Latin Vulgate into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal Stephen Langton who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. Robert Estienne (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).\n\nThe division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study.\n\nSeveral modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. Biblica published such a version of the NIV in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, Crossway published the ESV Reader's Bible and \"Bibliotheca\" published a modified ASV. Projects such as Icthus also exist which strip chapter and verse numbers from existing translations.\n\nThe number of words can vary depending upon aspects such as whether the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119, the superscriptions listed in some of the Psalms, and the subscripts traditionally found at the end of the Pauline epistles, are included.\nExcept where stated, the following apply to the King James Version of the Bible in its modern 66-book Protestant form including the New Testament and the protocanonical Old Testament, not the deuterocanonical books.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "97585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97585", "title": "Citation", "text": "Citation\n\nA citation is a reference to a published or unpublished source. More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.\n\nCitations have several important purposes: to uphold intellectual honesty (or avoiding plagiarism), to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used. As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words. Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.\n\nThe forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford, Harvard, MLA, American Sociological Association (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.\n\nBibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.\n\nA bibliographic citation is a reference to a book, article, web page, or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely. Different citation systems and styles are used in scientific citation, legal citation, prior art, the arts, and the humanities.\n\nCitation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:\n\nAlong with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include unique identifiers depending on the type of work being referred to.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing. However, the Council of Science Editors (CSE) adds a third, the\" citation-name system\".\n\nThe Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both. The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.\n\nFor example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system \"without\" a full bibliography could look like:\n\nThe note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:\n\nIn a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:\n\nThe bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:\n\nIn the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.\n\nParenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.\n\nAn example of a parenthetical reference:\n\nDepending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called \"References\", \"Bibliography\", \"Works cited\" or \"Works consulted\".\n\nIn-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a tooltip. This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.\n\nSuperscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.\n\nCitation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as the Chicago Manual of Style, are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as MLA and APA styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles. The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.\n\nA number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: Stephanus pagination for Plato; Bekker numbers for Aristotle; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or Shakespeare notation by play.\n\n\nIn some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional footnotes (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term \"footnote\" is actually used as a synonym for \"reference\", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.\n\n\n\n\nIn their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a \"half-life\", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.\n\nOther experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.\n\nAnother important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.\n\nResearch suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article. Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared. For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.\n\nCitation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles. On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.\n\n"}

Egghe & Rousseau once (1990, p. 228) explain \"when a document \"d\" cites a document \"d\", we can show this by an arrow going from the node representing \"d\" to the document representing \"d\". In this way the documents from a collection D form a directed graph, which is called a 'citation graph' or 'citation network' \".\n\nCitation is a reference to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.\nCitation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available. In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled \"Networks of Scientific Papers\". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called \"Research Reviews\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1719952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719952", "title": "Comparative research", "text": "Comparative research\n\nComparative research is a research methodology in the social sciences that aims to make comparisons across different countries or cultures. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of poverty).\n\nAs Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of \"episteme\" and \"philo-sophia\", as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. \"Episteme\", as a form and activity in the field of \"logos\", marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.\n\nMoreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic \"polis\". Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ \"Histories\" demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. \"isegoria\" and \"parrhesia\"), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.\n\nAccording also to Karl Deutsch, we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time. Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.\n\nTextbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after World War II. There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. Globalization has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. Information technology has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.\n\nComparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research. The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a \"seamless whole.\" \n\nThere are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data. The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful. \n\nSecondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent. A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.\n\nIn line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate \"grand theories,\" such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.\n\nComparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to. Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.\n\nThe historical comparative research involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.\n\nWhen it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2466507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2466507", "title": "Comparative sociology", "text": "Comparative sociology\n\nComparative sociology involves comparison of the social processes between nation states, or across different types of society (for example capitalist and socialist). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance. For example, structural Marxists have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies. The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.\n\nOne sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was Max Weber, whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" and Sociology of religion).\n\nThere is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. Emile Durkheim argued in \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called cross-national research.\n\n"}
{"id": "10485277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10485277", "title": "Comparison microscope", "text": "Comparison microscope\n\nA comparison microscope is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two microscopes connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.\n\nIn the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\n Philip O. Gravelle, a chemist, developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of firearms identification in forensic science. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the barrel, breach block, extractor, or firing pin in the gun. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. \"As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work.\" Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.Sir Sydney Smith also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to Scotland and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.\n\nThe modern instrument has many optical, mechanical and electronic refinements, including fiber optic illumination, video capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single firearm based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a \"no conclusion\" result if insufficient marks are present.\n\nSince, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match bullets and cartridge cases to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of forensic science.\n\nVisualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.\n\nThe prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the United States compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope. As with most firearms, the fired ammunition components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as \"ballistics\".\n\nHistorically, and currently, this forensic discipline ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired bullets or cartridge cases, one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.\n\nThe interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called rifling) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called \"lands\" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the barrel surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a \"signature\" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this \"signature\" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.\n\nWhen a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.\n\nForensic innovator Calvin Goddard offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure convictions of accused murderers and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a semi-automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Calvin Goddard in 1927.\nGoddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.\nIn October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.\n\nColonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in which seven gangsters were killed by rival Al Capone mobsters dressed as Chicago police officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at Northwestern University and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, ballistics, fingerprinting, blood analysis and trace evidence were all brought under one roof.\nIn 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.\n\n\n"}

In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often scripted or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA. \nProfessional wrestling could be considered a performance art which combines athletics with theatrical performance. Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of amateur wrestling, striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a \"worked\" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century Europe as a carnival attraction.\n\nMixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including wrestling, boxing and Martial Arts, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The early 1990s saw the Ultimate Fighting Championship popularize the term \"Mixed Martial Arts\", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.\n\nPossibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is Brock Lesnar, who has won the world championships in both the WWE and UFC.

{"id": "590473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590473", "title": "Contraction (grammar)", "text": "Contraction (grammar)\n\nA contraction is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.\n\nIn linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with crasis, abbreviations nor acronyms (including initialisms), with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all three are connoted by the term \"abbreviation\" in loose parlance. Contraction is also distinguished from clipping, where beginnings and endings are omitted.\n\nThe definition overlaps with the term portmanteau (a linguistic \"blend\"), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as \"do\" and \"not\", whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.\n\nEnglish has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an apostrophe in writing), as in \"I'm\" for \"I am\", and sometimes other changes as well, as in \"won't\" for \"will not\" or \"ain't\" for \"am not\". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of \"o'clock\").\n\nThe main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see English auxiliaries and contractions).\nSome other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of elision, may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as \"wanna\" for \"want to\", \"gonna\" for \"going to\", \"y'all\" for \"you all\", \"ya'll\" for \"ya all\" in the Southern United States and others common forms in colloquial speech.\n\nIn subject–auxiliary inversion, the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of \"He won't go\" is \"Won't he go\", whereas the uncontracted equivalent is \"Will he not go?\", with \"not\" following the subject.\n\nContractions exist in Classical Chinese, some of which are used in modern Chinese.\nContractions also appear in Cantonese, for example, 乜嘢 and 咩.\n\nThe French language has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in \"C'est la vie\" (\"That's life\"), where \"c'est\" stands for \"ce\" + \"est\" (\"that is\"). The formation of these contractions is called elision.\n\nIn general, any monosyllabic word ending in \"e caduc\" (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, \"h\" or \"y\" (as \"h\" is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; \"y\" sounds like \"i\"). In addition to \"ce\" → \"c'-\" (demonstrative pronoun \"that\"), these words are \"que\" → \"qu'-\" (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun \"that\"), \"ne\" → \"n'-\" (\"not\"), \"se\" → \"s'-\" (\"himself\", \"herself\", \"itself\", \"oneself\" before a verb), \"je\" → \"j'-\" (\"I\"), \"me\" → \"m'-\" (\"me\" before a verb), \"te\" → \"t'- \" (informal singular \"you\" before a verb), \"le\" or \"la\" → \"l'-\" (\"the\"; or \"he/she\", \"it\" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word \"y\" or \"en\"), and \"de\" → \"d'-\" (\"of\"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) \"*ce est\" or \"*que elle\".\n\n\"Moi\" (\"myself\") and \"toi\" (informal \"yourself\") mandatorily contract to \"m'-\" and \"t'-\" respectively after an imperative verb and before the word \"y\" or \"en\".\n\nIt is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction \"si\" (\"if\") is followed by \"il\" (\"he\", \"it\") or \"ils\" (\"they\"), which begin with the same vowel sound \"i\": \"*si il\" → \"s'il\" (\"if it\", if he\"); \"*si ils\" → \"s'ils\" (\"if they\").\n\nCertain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: \"au\" for \"à le\", \"aux\" for \"à les\", \"du\" for \"de le\", and \"des\" for \"de les\". However, the contraction of \"cela\" (demonstrative pronoun \"that\") to \"ça\" is optional and informal.\n\nIn informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, \"je ne sais pas\" (, \"I don't know\") may be pronounced roughly \"chais pas\" (), with the \"ne\" being completely elided and the of \"je\" being mixed with the of \"sais\". It is also common in informal contexts to contract \"tu\" to \"t'-\" before a vowel, e.g., \"t'as mangé\" for \"tu as mangé\".\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In colloquial Israeli Hebrew, the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter. Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, \"I saw the dog\") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).\n\nIn Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions \"a\", \"da\", \"di\", \"in\", \"su\", \"con\" and \"per\" combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely \"il\", \"lo\", \"la\", \"l',\" \"i\", \"gli\", \"gl',\" and \"le\".\n\n\nThe words \"ci\" and \"è\" (form of \"essere\", to be) and the words \"vi\" and \"è\" are contracted into \"c'è\" and \"v'è\" (both meaning \"there is\").\n\nThe words \"dove\" and any word that begins with \"e\" are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally \"come\" does be made so.\nAs well other words may be contracted the same these two, like \"quale\", and other ones, etcetera.\n\nSpanish has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: \"al\" (to the) for \"a el\", and \"del\" (of the) for \"de el\" (not to be confused with \"a él\", meaning \"to him\", and \"de él\", meaning \"his\" or, more literally, \"of him\").\n\nOther contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being \"de\" + personal and demonstrative pronouns: \"destas\" for \"de estas\" (of these, fem.), \"daquel\" for \"de aquel\" (of that, masc.), \"dél\" for \"de él\" (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with \"a-\": \"l'alma\" for \"la alma\", now \"el alma\" (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of \"aquí\" (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + \"otro/a\" (other): \"aqueste\", \"aqueso\", \"estotro\" etc. The modern \"aquel\" (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns \"nosotros\" (we) and \"vosotros\" (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: \"todol\" for \"todo el\" (all the, masc.), \"ques\" for \"que es\" (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.\n\nThough not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as \"conmigo\" for *\"con mí\" (with me), \"contigo\" for *\"con ti\" (with you sing.), \"consigo\" for *\"con sí\" (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).\n\nFinally, one can hear \"pa\"' for \"para\", deriving as \"pa'l\" for \"para el\", but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.\n\nIn Portuguese, contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, \"de\" (of) and \"por\" (by; formerly \"per\") combine with the definite articles \"o\" and \"a\" (masculine and feminine forms of \"the\" respectively), producing \"do\", \"da\" (of the), \"pelo\", \"pela\" (by the). The preposition \"de\" contracts with the pronouns \"ele\" and \"ela\" (he, she), producing \"dele\", \"dela\" (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb \"amar\" (to love) combines with the pronoun \"a\" (her), giving \"amá-la\" (to love her).\n\nAnother contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun \"da\" with words starting in \"a\", resulting in changing the first letter \"a\" for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: \"Estrela d'alva\" (A popular phrase to refer to Venus that means \"Alb star\", as a reference to its brightness) ; \"Caixa d'água\" (water tank).\n\nIn informal, spoken German prepositional phrases, one can often merge the preposition and the article; for example, \"von dem\" becomes \"vom\", \"zu dem\" becomes \"zum\", or \"an das\" becomes \"ans\". Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, \"aufm\" for \"auf dem\", \"unterm\" for \"unter dem\", etc. are also used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.\n\nThe pronoun \"es\" often contracts to \"s\" (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting \"Wie geht es?\" is usually encountered in the contracted form \"Wie geht's?\".\n\nRegional dialects of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's Standard German was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as \"in den\" becoming \"in'n\" (sometimes \"im\") or \"haben wir\" becoming \"hamwer\", \"hammor\", \"hemmer\", or \"hamma\" depending on local intonation preferences. Bavarian German features several more contractions such as \"gesund sind wir\" becoming \"xund samma\" which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German \"wir\" exists alongside Bavarian \"mir\", or \"mia\", with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer Franz Beckenbauer has as his catchphrase \"Schau mer mal\" (\"Schauen wir einmal\" - in English \"let's have a look\"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, \"Schau'n Mer Mal\".\n\nSuch features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: \"Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?\" is spoken as \"Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?\"\n\nSeveral West Central German dialects along the Rhine River have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of \"liaison\" is used. So, \"[Dat] kriegst Du nicht\" may become \"Kressenit\", or \"Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt\" may become \"Lomejon haschjesaat\".\n\nMostly, there are no binding orthographies for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.\n\nThe use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard Norwegian spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are \"jakke\" for \"jeg har ikke\", meaning \"I do not have\" and \"dække\" for \"det er ikke\", meaning \"there is not\". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often monosyllabic words like , , , , or . The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.\n\nIn extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is \"Det ordner seg av seg selv\" in standard written Bokmål, meaning \"It will sort itself out\" could become \"dånesæsæsjæl\" (note the letters Å and Æ, and the word \"sjæl\", as an eye dialect spelling of ). R-dropping, being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway , but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like .\n\nBecause of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official orthography. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.\n\nLatin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb \"nolo\" (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of \"non volo\" (\"volo\" meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).\n\nSome contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (\"-ssu\") for です (\"desu\") and すいません (\"suimasen\") for すみません (\"sumimasen\"). では (\"dewa\") is often contracted to じゃ (\"ja\"). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (\"no\") is contracted to simply ん (\"n\").\n\nWhen used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (\"-te\"), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated \"ikimasu\" (go) and the verb \"kimasu\" (come).\n\nThe ending ～なければ (\"-nakereba\") can be contracted to ～なきゃ (\"-nakya\") when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (\"ikanakya (ikenai)\") \"I have to go.\"\n\nOther times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:\n\nVarious dialects of Japanese also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.\n\nIn the Polish language pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are \"go\" and \"mu\". The non-contracted forms are \"jego\" (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and \"jemu\", respectively. The clitic \"-ń\" which stands for \"niego\" (him) as in \"dlań\" (\"dla niego\") is more common in literature. The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.\n\nUyghur, a Turkic language spoken in Central Asia, includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of compound verbs (serial verbs). For instance, \"sëtip alidu\" (sell-manage, \"manage to sell\") is usually written and pronounced \"sëtivaldu\", with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] leniting into a [v] or [w].\n\nIn Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like \"at\" and \"ay.\" In this chart, the \"@\" represents any vowel.\n"}

{"id": "46842976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46842976", "title": "Diels–Kranz numbering", "text": "Diels–Kranz numbering\n\nDiels–Kranz (DK) numbering is the standard system for referencing the works of the ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosophers, based on the collection of quotations from and reports of their work, \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\" (The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics), by Hermann Alexander Diels. The \"Fragmente\" was first published in 1903, was later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and was finally revised in a fifth edition (1934–7) by Walther Kranz and again in a sixth edition (1952). In Diels-Kranz, each passage, or item, is assigned a number which is used to uniquely identify the ancient personality with which it is concerned, and the type of item given. Diels-Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers, and the system also encompasses Sophists and pre-Homeric poets such as Orpheus.\n\nStephanus pagination is the comparable system for referring to Plato, and Bekker numbering is the comparable system for referring to Aristotle.\n\nThe works of the pre-Socratics have not survived extant to the present day. Our knowledge of them exists only through references in the works of later philosophers (known as doxography) in the form of quotations and paraphrases. For example, our knowledge of Thales of Miletus comes largely from the works of Aristotle, who lived centuries after him. Another interesting example of such a source is Hippolytus of Rome, whose polemic \"Refutation of All Heresies\" is a source of many direct quotations of Heraclitus as well as of other philosophers, thereby perpetuating the work of those he was refuting.\n\nThese quotations, paraphrases and other references to pre-Socratic philosophers were collected by Diels and Kranz in their book, which became a standard text in modern pre-Socratic education and scholarship. Because of its influence, Diels-Kranz numbering became the standard way of referencing the material: in literature, conferences, and even in conversation.\n\nThe number corresponding to an item was made up of three parts:\n\n\nWhy, take the case of Thales, Theodorus. While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.\n\nThe above text has a DK number of 11A9, since it refers to Thales who is, as mentioned above, chapter 11's subject. The source is \"Theaetetus\" (one of Plato's dialogues), and gives an account of Thales' life, hence it is a \"testimonium\", represented by the letter \"A\". Finally, it is the ninth item in its chapter, giving it the overall number of DK 11A9.\n\nSometimes, the chapter (personality) number may simply be replaced by the name, which can be helpful in cases where the former is the same as the passage number, to avoid ambiguity. For example:\n\nThose who seek for gold dig up much earth and find a little.\n\nRather than \"22B22\" the above may also instead be referred to as \"Heraclitus B22\" as it is a direct transmission of the words of Heraclitus (thus, B) and is the 22nd item in the chapter about Heraclitus (whose chapter number is also 22) in the \"Fragmente\".\n\nThe following table gives the Diels-Kranz numbering of Pre-Socratic philosophers. Note that the numbering scheme presented is that of the fifth edition of \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\", the first to be revised by Kranz. The fifth edition's numbering is the scheme which has since gained the most traction in modern Pre-Socratic scholarship, and it is the one used consistently throughout this article. It should not be confused with the numberings given in other versions, which changed frequently depending on the particular edition of the \"Fragmente\".\n\nMost entries (78) are concerned with a single, named individual, while the remaining minority of entries (12) have more complex context. Of these latter, eight (10, 19, 39, 46, 53-56) are each concerned with groups of named personalties, who typically have a clear relationship of some kind to justify their association in each entry. Two entries (58, 79) are devoted not to individuals, but to schools of thought (Pythagoreanism and Sophism), and the last two (89, 90) reproduce contemporaneous anonymous texts. Although \"the Seven Sages of Greece\" implies a clearly defined set of seven people, historical disagreement renders intractable the problem of exactly who they were, with multiple sources suggesting several different candidates. If one takes the Seven Sages as a group of seven and includes the later Iamblichus, Diels-Kranz encompasses 106 named personalities and two anonymous authors. The chapter on Sophism is concerned with the named sophists who take up most of the rest of the scheme, and \nper Freeman with regard to the chapter on Pythagoreanism, a catalogue due to Iamblichus lists 218 named men and 17 named women as Pythagoreans, along with other probable, anonymous adherents.\n\nIn several cases, the personalities listed are so obscure that they are merely mentioned by name in other sources, commonly with hints as to their geographical and philosophical associations, and without even surviving \"paraphrases\" of any of their ideas, or what they might have written. That is, these more obscure personalities survive in the historical record only as names cited by others, and so came to be included in Diels-Kranz for the sake of scholarly completeness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1054566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1054566", "title": "Ditloid", "text": "Ditloid\n\nA ditloid is a type of word puzzle, in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated. The name 'ditloid' was given by the \"Daily Express\" newspaper, originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ \"1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\".\n\nWill Shortz originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of \"Games\" magazine, calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of \"What's hot and what's not,\" \"Us\" magazine named the Equation Analysis Test in the \"what's hot\" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:\nSome anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from \"Games\" (word for word, except for my byline),\nphotocopied it, and passed it along.

When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized\nthe format was a good one for eliciting the \"aha effect\". After that I\nused such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on\ncreative thinking.\nMy guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is\nthat the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in\nan incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly\nsee an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral\nrather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had\nthe answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously\nthinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about\nto fall asleep.\nAnother factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge\non obscure information.

{"id": "500948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=500948", "title": "Field guide", "text": "Field guide\n\nA field guide is a book designed to help the reader identify wildlife (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. minerals). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects. Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.\n\nIt will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include identification keys to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.\n\nPopular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 \"How to Know the Wildflowers\" by \"Mrs. William Starr Dana\" (Frances Theodora Parsons). In 1890, Florence Merriam published \"Birds Through an Opera-Glass\", describing 70 common species. Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides. In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist Vernon Bailey), she published \"Handbook of Birds of the Western United States\". By contrast, the \"Handbook\" is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by taxonomic order and had clear descriptions of species size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.\n\nFrom this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by Chester A. Reed and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.\n\nIn 1934, Roger Tory Peterson, using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the \"Peterson Identification System\", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from animal tracks to seashells and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.\n\nToday, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization. Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the Audubon Society, the RSPB, the Field Studies Council, National Geographic, HarperCollins, and many others all produce quality field guides.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.\n\nFor general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.\n\nGuides for students often introduce the concept of identification keys. Plant field guides such as \"Newcomb's Wildflower Guide\" (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search. Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.\n\nMany taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:\n\nField guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.\n\n"}
{"id": "20819040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20819040", "title": "Hashtag", "text": "Hashtag\n\nA hashtag is a type of metadata tag used on social networks such as Twitter and other microblogging services, allowing users to apply dynamic, user-generated tagging which makes it possible for others to easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing the number sign or pound sign codice_1 usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. The hashtag may contain letters, digits, and underscores. Searching for that hashtag will yield each message that has been tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag. For example, on the photo-sharing service Instagram, the hashtag \"#bluesky\" allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag. \n\nThe use of hashtags was first proposed by Chris Messina in a 2007 tweet that, although initially decried by Twitter as a \"thing for nerds\", eventually led to their use spreading like wild-fire through the platform. Messina, who made no attempt to copyright the use because he felt \"they were born of the internet, and owned by no one\", has subsequently been credited as the godfather of the hashtag. By the end of the decade hashtags could be seen in most emerging as well as established social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. So much so that Instagram had to officially place a \"30 hashtags\" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing their use, a limit which Instagrammers eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts. As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags and their use is highly common with millennials, Gen Z, politicians, influencers, and celebrities worldwide. Because of its widespread use, \"hashtag\" was added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in June 2014. The term \"hashtag\" is also sometimes erroneously used to refer to the hash symbol itself when used in the context of a hashtag. Formal taxonomies can be developed from the folk taxonomy rendered machine-readable by the markup that hashtags provide; this process is called folksonomy.\nThe US pound sign, number sign or hash symbol \"#\" is often used in information technology to highlight a special meaning. (\"Pound sign\" in the UK means \"£\"; \"#\" is called hash, gate, and occasionally octothorpe.) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote \"immediate\" address mode in the assembly language of the PDP-11 when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used \"#\" in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor. In the 1986 SGML standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals, --e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union approved in November 1988 recommendation E.161 that put the hash sign on the right side of the 0 in the 4 x 3 button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the hash: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most hash signs in Europe now follow the 80-degree inclination.\n\nThe pound sign was adopted for use within IRC networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics. Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an ampersand '&').\n\nThe use of the pound sign in IRC inspired Chris Messina to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network. He posted the first hashtag on Twitter:\n\nMessina’s suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the 2007 San Diego forest fires in Southern California.\n\nAccording to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for \"lay\" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag \"was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages.\" Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details.\n\nInternationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and Persian-language hashtags in communications during the events.\n\nThe first published use of the term \"hash tag\" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, \"Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings,\" on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer Ben Zimmer, chair of the American Dialect Society's New Words Committee.\n\nBeginning July 2, 2009, Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced \"Trending Topics\" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to spam the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.\n\nAlthough the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+.\n\nA hashtag must begin with a hash character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space, or end of message. It is always safe to precede the “#” with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores. In many cases other characters are also allowed, in particular accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another, and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&, or #Romeo&Juliet. Hashtags are not case sensitive; a search for “#hashtag” will find “#HashTag”. The use of embedded capitals (CamelCase) increases readability and avoids confusion; a (real) pen shop would be advised to use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case. On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g. “It is #sunny today”).\n\nLanguages which do not use letters are handled slightly differently. In China, microblogs Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between Chinese characters necessitates a closing tag. Twitter uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and orthographies with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g. '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你') or by zero-width non-joiner characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '我‌#爱‌你', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).\n\nIt is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the \"absolute maximum\", and any contribution exceeding this risks \"raising the ire of the community.\"\n\nAs well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation, could cause an account to be filtered from search, or suspended.\n\nJimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" in September 2013.\n\nHashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can \"trend\" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the \"Trending Topics\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \"retired\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \"trending topics\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and \"follow\" (subscribe) or \"list\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nTelevision broadcasters such as Channel 4 have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as First Dates and The Undateables. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network Instagram, by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use. The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular subaltern communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.\n\nFamous Youtube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.\n\nHashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.\n\nThis can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \"BREAKING: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.\n\nThe feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on YouTube and Gawker Media. In the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments were used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees were not logged into the website. Real-time search aggregators such as the former Google Real-Time Search also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the \"river\" of Twitter posts that can result from search terms or hashtags.\n\nThe use of hashtags has extended to televisiona concept that began rising in prominence in the early 2010s. Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen bug, encouraging viewers to participate in a backchannel of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. Television commercials have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes. Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.\n\nWhile personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \"branded\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., #edshow as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \"trend\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. #SunnyFX) and instantaneous, \"temporary\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts. Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the Nielsen television ratings system.\n\nAn example of trending \"temporary\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon, a variety talk show on NBC. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \"Tonight Show Hashtags,\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \"Tonight Show Hashtags\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \"keywords\" by AOL in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.\n\nThe late-night television comedy game show @midnight with Chris Hardwick on Comedy Central features a daily game entitled \"Hashtag Wars,\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.\n\nSome hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \"Je suis Charlie,\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with \"Charlie Hebdo\" offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.\n\nSince February 2013 Twitter and American Express have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.\n\nOrganized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as #OccupyWallStreet and #LibyaFeb17, have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially titled the 2018 Russia–United States summit as the \"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\".\n\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \"bashtag\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, McDonald's created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.\n\nThe use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest predictor of whether or not a statement is sarcastic—a difficult AI problem.\n\nThe YouTuber Spencer FC used the hashtag for the name and crest of his YouTube-based association football team, Hashtag United F.C..\n\nSince the 2012–13 season, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE. The tweets and Facebook posts must include #NBAVOTE along with the player's first and last name or Twitter handle.\n\nDuring the April 2011 Canadian party leader debate, Jack Layton, then-leader of the New Democratic Party, referred to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's crime policies as \"a hashtag fail\" (presumably #fail).\n\nThe term \"hashtag rap\", coined by Kanye West, was developed in the 2010s to describe a style of rapping which, according to Rizoh of the \"Houston Press,\" uses \"three main ingredients: a metaphor, a pause, and a one-word punch line, often placed at the end of a rhyme\". Rappers Nicki Minaj, Big Sean, Drake, and Lil Wayne are credited with the popularization of hashtag rap, while the style has been criticized by Ludacris, The Lonely Island, and various music writers.\n\nOn September 13, 2013, a hashtag, #TwitterIPO, appeared in the headline of a \"New York Times\" front-page article regarding Twitter's initial public offering.\n\nBird's Eye foods released in 2014 a shaped mashed potato food that included forms of @-symbols and hashtags, called \"Mashtags\".\n\nHashtags have been used verbally to make a humorous point in informal conversations, such as \"I’m hashtag confused!\" In August 2012, British journalist Tom Meltzer reported in \"The Guardian\" about a new hand gesture that mimicked the hashtag, sometimes called the \"finger hashtag\", in which both hands form a peace sign, and then the fingers are crossed to form the symbol of a hashtag. The emerging gesture was reported about in \"Wired\" by Nimrod Kamer, and during 2013, it was seen on TV as used by Jimmy Fallon, and on \"The Colbert Report,\" among other programs. Writing in 2015, Paola Maria Caleff considered this usage a fad, but noted that people talking the way that they write was a consequence of computer-mediated communication.\n\n\n\n"}

It is used to refer to one's self and is capitalized, although other pronouns, such as \"he\" or \"she\", are not capitalized.\n\nThe grammatical variants of \"I\" are \"me\", \"my\", \"mine\", and \"myself\".\n\nEnglish \"I\" originates from Old English (OE) \"ic\". Its predecessor \"ic\" had in turn originated from the continuation of Proto-Germanic *\"ik\", and \"ek\"; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, \"ek\" was attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant \"eka\"; see also ek erilaz). Linguists assume \"ik\" to have developed from the unstressed variant of \"ek\". Variants of \"ic\" were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.\n\nGermanic cognates are: Old Frisian \"ik\", Old Norse \"ek\" (Danish, Norwegian \"jeg\", Swedish \"jag\", Icelandic ég), Old High German \"ih\" (German \"ich\") and Gothic \"ik\" and in Dutch also \"ik\".\n\nThe Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the Proto Indo-European language (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *\"egō, egóm\", with cognates including\nSanskrit \"aham\", Hittite \"uk\", Latin \"ego\", Greek \"egō\", Old Slavonic \"azъ\" and Alviri-Vidari (an Iranian language) \"az\".\n\nThe oblique forms are formed from a stem \"*me-\" (English \"me\"), the plural from \"*wei-\" (English \"we\"), the oblique plurals from \"*ns-\" (English \"us\") and from Proto-Germanic \"*unseraz\", PIE \"*no-s-ero-\" (\"our, ours\").\n\n\"I\" (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English. This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase \"i\" was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.\n\nLike the other English personal pronouns \"we\" (\"us\"), \"he\" (\"him\"), \"she\" (\"her\"), and \"they\" (\"them\"), the pronoun \"I\" has several singular case forms.\nThese are: \n\nThere are some situations in which only the nominative form (\"I\") is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (\"me\") is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.\n\nIn all varieties of standard English, the nominative form \"I\" is used exclusively when it is the whole subject of an \"explicit\" verb, e.g. \nnot \nWith other pronouns, such as \"we\" (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.\n\nIn all varieties of standard English, the accusative form \"me\" is used exclusively when it is the whole direct or indirect object of a verb or preposition. The accusative \"me\" is also required in a number of constructions such as \"Silly me!\"\n\nIn many situations, both the nominative \"I\" and the accusative \"me\" are encountered.\n\nWhen the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative \"I\" is sometimes encountered in (very) formal style:\nBut this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:\n\"Me\" is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:\nThe nominative \"I\" is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:\nthough even here \"me\" is more common in non-formal style:\n\nFollowing \"as\" or \"than\" (without a following explicit verb), the accusative form is common:\nHowever, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and \"than\" or \"as\" as a conjunction, the nominative \"I\" is found in formal style:\n\nIn Australian English, British English and Irish English, many speakers have an unstressed form of \"my\" that is identical to \"me\" (see archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns).\n\nThe above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.\nIn some varieties English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as \"you and I\". So the correct form is \n\nIn some varieties of non-standard informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative \"subject\" construction, as in\nThis is highly stigmatized.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of the nominative \"I\" in coordinative constructions like \"you and I\"where \"me\" would be used in a non-coordinative object is less stigmatized – and in some cases so widespread as to be considered a variety of standard English: \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6487324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6487324", "title": "Leishu", "text": "Leishu\n\nThe leishu () is a genre of reference books historically compiled in China and other countries of the Sinosphere. The term is generally translated as \"encyclopedia\", although the \"leishu\" are quite different from the modern notion of encyclopedia.\n\nThe \"leishu\" are composed of sometimes lengthy citations from other works, and often contain copies of entire works, not just excerpts. The works are classified by a systematic set of categories, which are further divided into subcategories. \"Leishu\" may be considered anthologies, but are encyclopedic in the sense that they may comprise the entire realm of knowledge at the time of compilation.\n\nApproximately 600 \"leishu\" were compiled from the early third century until the eighteenth century, of which 200 have survived. The largest \"leishu\" ever compiled was the 1408 \"Yongle Dadian\", containing 370 million Chinese characters, and the largest ever printed was the \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\", containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.\n\nThe genre first appeared in the early third century. The earliest known was the \"Huanglan\" (\"Emperor's mirror\"). Sponsored by the emperor of Cao Wei, it was compiled around 220, but has since been lost. However, the term \"leishu\" was not used until the Song dynasty (960–1279).\n\nIn later imperial China dynasties, such as the Ming and Qing, emperors sponsored monumental projects to compile all known human knowledge into a single \"leishu\", in which entire works, rather than excerpts, were copied and classified by category. The largest \"leishu\" ever compiled, on the order of the Yongle Emperor of Ming, was the \"Yongle Dadian\" containing a total of 370 million Chinese characters. The project involved 2,169 scholars, who worked for four years under general editor Yao Guangxiao. It was completed in 1408, but never printed, as the imperial treasury had run out of money.\n\nThe \"Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" (Imperially approved synthesis of books and illustrations past and present) is by far the largest \"leishu\" ever printed, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages. It was compiled by a team of scholars led by Chen Menglei, and printed between 1726 and 1728, during the Qing dynasty.\n\nThe \"riyong leishu\" (encyclopedias for daily use), containing practical information for people who were literate but below the Confucian elite, were also compiled in the later imperial era. Today, they provide scholars with valuable information on non-elite culture and attitudes.\n\nAccording to Jean-Pierre Diény, the Jiaqing reign (1796–1820) of the Qing dynasty saw the end of the publication of \"leishu\".\n\nOther countries of the Sinosphere also adopted the genre of \"leishu\". In 1712, the \"Sancai Tuhui\", a richly illustrated \"leishu\" compiled by Ming scholar Wang Qi (王圻) in the early 17th century, was printed in Japan as \"Wakan Sansai Zue\". The Japanese version was edited by Terajima Ryōan (寺島良安), a physician born in Osaka.\n\nThe \"leishu\" have played an important role in the preservation of ancient works, many of which have been lost, only preserved completely or partially as part of a \"leishu\" compilation. The 7th-century \"Yiwen Leiju\" is especially valuable. It contains excerpts from 1,400 pre-7th century works, 90% of which have been otherwise lost. Even though the \"Yongle Dadian\" is itself largely lost, the remnants still contain 385 complete books that have been otherwise lost. The \"leishu\" also provide a unique view of the transmission of knowledge and education, and an easy way to locate traditional materials on any given subject.\n\nApproximately 600 \"leishu\" were compiled, from the Cao Wei period (early third century) until the 18th century, of which 200 have survived.

They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds. \n\nThe books were produced with paper dust covers up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as \"Glossies\". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.\n\nThe first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds. This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.\n\nIn 1942 a special edition book was brought out on \"airplanes\" . This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes. It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. \n\nThe first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like \"Aircraft\", \"Automobiles\" and \"Railway Locomotives\" proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. \n\nWhen Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).\n\nAfter a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled \"Observer's Book of Observer's Books\" in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of \"Wayside and Woodland\" in 2003.\n"}

Using a structured reference interview, the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them. To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.\n\nThe ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a book or journal article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library's online catalog or subscription bibliographic/fulltext databases, or simply factual information drawn from the library's print or online reference collection. Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources. Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions. A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.\n\nThe services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff.\n\nReference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries. At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected. Beginning in 1883 with the Boston Public Library, libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services.\n\nOne of the earliest proponents of references services was Samuel Swett Green. He wrote an article titled \"Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers\" which had a large impact on the future of reference services.\nthen, it operated to incorporate ... making the following variables relevant in offering reference services: the user's query; the reference librarian; and, the reference sources. Until hitherto the communication between the reference librarian and the user are through direct contact. Hence, Utor (2008), defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information. That is during the traditional era. towards the later decades of 19th century, however, reference and information services witnessed an insidious yet drastic paradigm-shift following the incorporation of information communication technology in reference services (and in library operations, by extension). Thus leading to an entirely new era, otherwise known as digital era with different information technologies coming in to aid the work of a reference librarian; changing information sources, reference processes and communication medium.\n\nResources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:\n\nServices that are often available at a library reference desk include:\n\nThe librarian who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:\n\nIn the United States, those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master's degree in library science from a program accredited by the American Library Association. However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor's degree in library science may perform these duties.

{"id": "1130951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130951", "title": "Scribal abbreviation", "text": "Scribal abbreviation\n\nScribal abbreviations or sigla (singular: siglum) are the abbreviations used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in Latin, and later in Greek and Old Norse. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) \"sigla\" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the copyist(s) of a work. See Critical apparatus.\n\nAbbreviated writing, using \"sigla\", arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials (stone, metal, parchment, etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, lapidaries, engravers, and copyists made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic, several abbreviations, known as \"sigla\" (plural of \"siglum\" = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the Roman Empire. Additionally, in this period shorthand entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian Xenophon in the memoir of Socrates, and it was called \"notae socratae\". In the late Roman Republic, the Tironian notes were developed possibly by Marcus Tullius Tiro, Cicero's amanuensis, in 63 BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the Latin minuscule hand and square and rustic capital letters. The notation was akin to modern stenographic writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the Carolingians, who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a \"murky existence\" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by Johannes Trithemius, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (\"notae benenses\").\n\nTo learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD); the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. \"Sigla\" were mostly used in lapidary inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.\n\nThe abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the Carolingian Renaissance (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called \"notae communes\", were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called \"notae juris\", appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured \"ad hoc\" to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.\n\nScribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.\n\nIn epigraphy, common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:\n\nBoth forms of abbreviation are called \"suspensions\" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by \"contraction\" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, Nomina Sacra; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for \"Dis Manibus\" (\"Dedicated to the Manes\"); IHS from the first three letters of \"ΙΗΣΟΥΣ\"; and RIP for \"requiescat in pace\" (\"Rest in Peace\") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.\n\nAnother practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted \"Augustus\", thus, AVGG denoted \"Augusti duo\"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote \"Consulibus duobus\", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a \"vinculum\" (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the \"tilde\" (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.\n\nBesides the \"tilde\" and macron marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The \"typographic\" abbreviations should not be confused with the \"phrasal\" abbreviations: i.e. (\"id est\" — \"that is\"); loc. cit. (\"loco citato\" — \"in the passage already cited\"); viz. (\"vide licet\" — \"namely\", \"that is to say\", \"in other words\" — formed with \"vi\" and the \"yogh\"-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix -et and the conjunction et) and et cetera.\n\nMoreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including ligatures (e.g. Æ, Œ, etc.), the long s (ſ), and the half r, resembling an Arabic numeral two (\"2\"). The \"u\" and \"v\" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the \"i\" and \"j\" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using \"u\" and \"i\" for vowels and \"v\" and \"j\" for consonants is a late typographic development.\n\nSome ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin ampersand (&) replaces the conjunction \"and\" in English, \"et\" in Latin and French, and \"y\" in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the \"y\" is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign ⁊, resembling the digit seven (\"7\"), represents the conjunction \"et\" and is written only to the x-height; in current Irish language usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction \"agus\" (\"and\"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the percentage sign (%), from the Italian \"per cento\" (\"per hundred\"); the permille sign (‰), from the Italian \"per mille\" (\"per thousand\"); the pound sign (₤, £ and #, all descending from ℔ or lb, \"librum\") and the dollar sign ($), which possibly derives from the Spanish word \"Peso\". The commercial at symbol (@), originally denoting \"at the rate/price of\", is a ligature derived from the English preposition \"at\"; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of e-mail addresses.\n\nTypographically, the ampersand (\"&\"), representing the word \"et\", is a space-saving ligature of the letters \"e\" and \"t\", its component graphemes. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), when Ancient Greek language manuscripts introduced that tongue to Western Europe, its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-Latinist Protestant Reformation (1517–1648).\n\nThe common abbreviation \"Xmas,\" for Christmas, is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the Greek letter chi (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.\n\nAfter the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in Church Slavonic and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special diacritic symbol titlo, as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: \"Sacred names\") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in Greek ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to \"good\" beings and the same words, when referring to \"bad\" beings, are spelled out; for example, while \"God\" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as \"\", \"god\" referring to \"false\" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for \"angel\" is generally abbreviated as \"\", but the word for \"angels\" is spelled out for \"performed by evil angels\" in Psalm 77.\n\nAdriano Cappelli's \"Lexicon Abbreviaturarum\", enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often copying errors. For example, \"e.g.\" is written with periods, but modern terms, such as \"PC\", may be written in uppercase.\n\nIt should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to Western calligraphy or a beginner's guide.\n\nAdditionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two runes were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for \"fé\" \"cattle, goods\" and ᛘ for \"maðr\" \"man\".\n\nCappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:\n\nSuspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:\n\nThe largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.\n\nA dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.\nFor plural words, the siglum is often doubled: \"F.\" = \"frater\" and \"FF.\" = \"fratres\". Tripled sigla often stand for three: \"DDD\" = \"domini tres\".\n\nLetters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for \"con\" or \"contra\" (the latter sometimes with a macron above, \"Ↄ̄\").\n\nTo avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as \"ΧΡ\" (Greek letters chi+rho) = \"Christus\" or \"IHS\" = \"Jesus\".\n\nStarting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.\n\nAbbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:\n\nSuch marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (\"independent\" of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.\n\nThe meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.\n\nA superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter \"r\", before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter \"r\" before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is \"r-coloured\".\n\nHowever, \"a\", \"i\", and \"o\" above \"g\" meant \"gͣ\" \"gna\", \"gͥ\" \"gni\" and \"gͦ\" \"gno\" respectively. Although in English, the \"g\" is silent in \"gn\", but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above \"q\" meant \"qu\" + vowel: \"qͣ\", \"qͤ\", \"qͥ\", \"qͦ\", \"qͧ\".\n\n\nVowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were \"c\", e.g. \"nͨ\". A cut \"l\" above an \"n\", \"nᷝ\", meant \"nihil\" for instance.\n\nThese marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as \"letter-like glyphs\". Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are alchemical and zodiac symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.\n\nIn addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.\nMany more ligatures were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.\nSome such as r rotunda, long s and uncial or insular variants (Insular G), Claudian letters were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: thorn (þ=th) and eth (ð=dh).\nAn illuminated manuscript would feature miniatures, decorated initials or \"littera notabilior\", which later resulted in the bicamerality of the script (case distinction).\n\nVarious typefaces have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include \"record type\", which was first developed in the 1770s to publish Domesday Book and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.\n\nIn the Unicode Standard v. 5.1 (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts \"Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement\" (26 characters), \"Latin Extended Additional\" (10 characters), \"Supplemental Punctuation\" (15 characters), \"Ancient Symbols\" (12 characters) and especially \"Latin Extended-D\" (89 characters).\nThese consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in LaTeX or using overstrike in MS Word).\n\nCharacters are \"the smallest components of written language that have semantic value\" but glyphs are \"the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23499848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23499848", "title": "Secondary source", "text": "Secondary source\n\nIn scholarship, a secondary source is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a primary source, which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. \n\nA secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. \nThe most accurate classification for any given source is not always obvious. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\" are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used. A third level, the tertiary source, such as an encyclopedia or dictionary, resembles a secondary source in that it contains analysis, but attempts to provide a broad introductory overview of a topic.\n\nInformation can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called symbolic sources. Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone. Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a midden, regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document. \n\nMany sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used. Moreover, the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents. Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.\n\nWhether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \"primary\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \"secondary\".\n\nAttempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further \"levels\". One such model is the UNISIST model of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.\n\nSome other modern languages use more than one word for the English word \"source\". German usually uses \"Sekundärliteratur\" (\"secondary literature\") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving \"Sekundärquelle\" (\"secondary source\") to historiography. A \"Sekundärquelle\" is a source which can tell about a lost \"Primärquelle\" (\"primary source\"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.\n\nIn general, secondary sources are self-described as review articles or meta-analysis.\n\nPrimary source materials are typically defined as \"original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study.\" An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in IMRAD style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study. In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature. A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.\n\nA book review that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book. A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.\n\nIn library and information sciences, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to primary sources in the context of the particular information or idea under study.\n\nAn important use of secondary sources in the field of mathematics has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public; in other sciences tertiary sources are expected to fulfill the introductory role.\n\nSecondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or scholarly journals, from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a peer reviewed article is always a secondary source.\nThe delineation of sources as primary and secondary first arose in the field of historiography, as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing. In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. In original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.\n\nFollowing the Rankean model established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use archives of primary sources. Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.\n\nIn the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the headnotes of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias. Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and precedential, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.\n\n\"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor.\" Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event \"when the fallibility of memory is an important factor\" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.\n\nAn autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in World War I written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.\n\n\n"}

Organisms' capability of reproduction leads to self-perpetuation of the species, if not to the individual. Populations self-perpetuate and grow. Entire ecosystems show homeostasis, and thus perpetuate themselves. The slow modifying effect of succession and similar shifts in the composition of the system can, however, not be neglected in the long run. Overall, life's object's capabilities of self-perpetuation are always accompanied by evolution, a perfect steady state of the biological system is never reached. Sexual reproduction is also a form of imperfect self-replication and thus imperfect self-perpetuation because of recombination and mutation. Organisms are not like self-replicating machine but amass random modifications from generation to generation. The property of self-perpetuation in the strict sense thus only applies to life itself.\n\nIn a social context, self-perpetuation is tied to reflexivity and (usually) positive feedback loops:\nDepending on the time scope or the context, self-perpetuation either depends on self-sustainability, or is equivalent to it. While we may talk about the self-sustainability of an ecosystem, this depends amongst other factor on the self-perpetuation of its constituting species.\n\nIn computer science, self-reproducing programs constitute an incomplete metaphor for self-perpetuation. A better analogue can be seen in computer viruses which are actually able to self-reproduce - given a suitable computing environment.\n\n"}

In translation, a source text is the original text that is to be translated into another language.\n\nIn historiography, distinctions are commonly made between three kinds of source texts:\n\nPrimary sources are firsthand written evidence of history made at the time of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study. These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with \"direct, unmediated information about the object of study.\" Primary sources are sources which, usually, are recorded by someone who participated in, witnessed, or lived through the event. These are also usually authoritative and fundamental documents concerning the subject under consideration. This includes published original accounts, published original works, or published original research. They may contain original research or new information not previously published elsewhere. They have been distinguished from secondary sources, which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. They serve as an original source of information or new ideas about the topic. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\", however, are relative terms, and any given source may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how it is used. Physical objects can be primary sources.\n\nSecondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. \n\nTertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources. These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are encyclopedias and textbooks.\n\nThe distinction between \"primary source\" and \"secondary source\" is standard in historiography, while the distinction between these sources and \"tertiary sources\" is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself.\n\nBelow are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes \"generally\" the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). \"P\" is for Primary sources, \"S\" is for Secondary sources, and \"T\" is for Tertiary sources. (ed., those with \"?\"s are indeterminate.)\nIn translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given source language which is to be, or has been, translated into another language. In translation the source text (ST) is transformed into a target text (TT), written in a given target language. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, \"the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)\". \n\nTranslation scholars including Eugene Nida and Peter Newmark have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.\n"}
{"id": "26681002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26681002", "title": "Text annotation", "text": "Text annotation\n\nText Annotation is the practice and the result of adding a note or gloss to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and editing, commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text. Text annotations are sometimes referred to as marginalia, though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.\n\nThis article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also Web annotation.\n\nText annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in Talmudic commentaries and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.\n\nWith the rise of the printing press and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text. Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or textual footnotes or endnotes rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.\n\nComputer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, learning, social reading, writing and editing, and other practices. Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and storage that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.\n\nText annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article \"From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation,\" scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)\"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks,\" which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)\"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers,\" which involves sharing of annotations; (3)\"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators,\" which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)\"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages,\" for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function. Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, motivation, and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support memory and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.\n\nEducational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and communication. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports comprehension and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.\n\nOther areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for collaborative learning, both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products. In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of critical reading and stance-taking necessary for effective argumentative writing.\n\nWhile shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, \"since the 1920s, literacy theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy.\" Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.\n\nMore recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at Carnegie Mellon University. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.\n\nSimilarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, critical thinking, and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.\n\nA meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them English, sport psychology, and hypermedia. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, metacognition, and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.\n\nText annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text. In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called \"queries\"). Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks. Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.\n\nMuch research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of computer-supported cooperative work.\n\nResearch in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.\n\nThe structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a \"body\", an \"anchor\", and a \"marker\". The body of an annotation includes reader-generated symbols and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.\n\nIT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:\nAnnotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions. Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as \"anchored discussion\".\n\nIT-based annotation systems include standalone and client-server systems. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of libraries, patent offices, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce taxonomies of annotation forms. Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in Palo Alto and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995 at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).\n\nAnnotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer and Microsoft Word. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as Adobe Acrobat, which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.\n\nTim Berners-Lee had already implemented the concept of directly editing web documents in 1990 in WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability. An early version of NCSA Mosaic in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability, though it was quickly removed. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, WebDAV, was then reintroduced as an extension.\n\nA different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document. This approach was pioneered by Stet, the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the GNU General Public License. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The co-ment system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using Django/Python on the server side and various AJAX libraries such as JQuery on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nSince 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project has offered the free, open web annotation service Hypothes.is. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a LMS or CMS. Both webpages and PDFs can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, HyLighter supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on NLP tasks as Named-entity recognition, relationship extraction or normalization. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via supervised learning.\n\nSpecialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal PLoS ONE, published by the Public Library of Science, has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.\n\n\n"}

It was released in the UK and US in August 2009 by Penguin Books through its Rough Guides imprint.\n\n\"The Rough Guide to True Crime\" is a compilation of a variety of cases, including historic crimes, with sections broken down by the type of offenses and who committed them. It includes black-and-white photos as illustration. Psychological profiles are included throughout by forensic expert Dr. Louis B. Schlesinger, who explains the psychology of serial killers, murderers, hit men and burglars. The book features serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, mob hitman Richard \"The Iceman\" Kuklinski, John Wayne Glover \"The Granny Killer,\" and British \"Doctor of Death\" Harold Shipman.\n\nScott's story from \"The Rough Guide to True Crime\" about mob enforcer Herbert Blitzstein was selected for inclusion in the July 2012 retrospective of crime writing, \"Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre\".\n\nThe author appeared on BlogTalkRadio's \"True Murder\" show and described some of the crimes included in the book that were committed in the 19th century as \"a different time in America, where people like Billy the Kid could walk in and just rob a bank\" and get away with it. And while \"there was nothing glamorous about what they did, they are a part of lore.\"\n\nThe book was featured at BookExpo America 2009's trade fair in DK Publishing's booth in New York City.\n\nIn a review, \"True Crime Book Reviews\" wrote, \"From the Moors murders and Harold Shipman, to the murder of 2pac, this guide illuminates the psychology in play behind the most intriguing crimes in history, from the absurd to the appalling. \"The Rough Guide to True Crime\" explores the best of the haunting genre of True Crime.\"\n\n\n"}
