They were invented by Lee Sallows, who also coined the word \"autogram\". An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as “one”, “two”, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called ‘self-enumerating’ or ‘self-documenting’ sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:\n\nThe first autogram to be published was composed by Sallows in 1982 and appeared in Douglas Hofstadter's \"Metamagical Themas\" column in \"Scientific American\".\n\nThe task of producing an autogram is perplexing because the object to be described cannot be known until its description is first complete.\n\nA type of autogram that has attracted special interest is the autogramic pangram, a self-enumerating sentence in which every letter of the alphabet occurs at least once. Certain letters do not appear in either of the two autograms above, which are therefore not pangrams. The first ever self-enumerating pangram appeared in a Dutch newspaper and was composed by Rudy Kousbroek. Sallows, who lives in the Netherlands, was challenged by Kousbroek to produce a self-enumerating ‘translation’ of this pangram into English—an impossible-seeming task. This prompted Sallows to construct an electronic Pangram Machine. Eventually the machine succeeded, producing the example below which was published in Scientific American in October 1984:\n\nSallows wondered if one could produce a pangram that counts its letters as percentages of the whole sentence–a particularly difficult task since such percentages usually won't be exact integers. He mentioned the problem to Chris Patuzzo and in late 2015 Patuzzo produced the following solution:\n\nAutograms exist that exhibit extra self-descriptive features. Besides counting each letter, here the total number of letters appearing is also named:\n\nJust as an autogram is a sentence that describes itself, so there exist closed chains of sentences each of which describes its predecessor in the chain. Viewed thus, an autogram is such a chain of length 1. Here follows a chain of length 2:\nA special kind of autogram is the ‘reflexicon’ (short for “reflexive lexicon”), which is a self-descriptive word list that describes its own letter frequencies. The constraints on reflexicons are much tighter than on autograms because the freedom to choose alternative words such as “contains”, “comprises”, “employs”, and so on, is lost. However, a degree of freedom still exists through appending entries to the list that are strictly superfluous.\n\nFor example, “Sixteen e's, six f's, one g, three h's, nine i's, nine n's, five o's, five r's, sixteen s's, five t's, three u's, four v's, one w, four x's” is a reflexicon, but it includes what Sallows calls “dummy text” in the shape of “one g” and “one w”. The latter might equally be replaced with “one #”, where “#” can be any typographical sign not already listed. Sallows has made an extensive computer search and conjectures that there exist but three and only three pure (i.e., no dummy text) English reflexicons.\n\n"}

The opposite is a heterological word, one that does not apply to itself (e.g. \"long\" is not long, \"monosyllabic\" has five syllables).\n\nUnlike more general concepts of autology and self-reference, this particular distinction and opposition of \"autological\" and \"heterological words\" is uncommon in linguistics for describing linguistic phenomena or classes of words, but is current in logic and philosophy where it was introduced by Kurt Grelling and Leonard Nelson for describing a semantic paradox, later known as Grelling's paradox or the Grelling–Nelson paradox. \n\nOne source of autological words is ostensive definition: the reference to a class of words by an example of the member of the class, as it were by synecdoche: such as mondegreen, oxymoron, eggcorn, bahuvrihi, etc.\nA word's status as autological may change over time.

Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use. Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference. Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;\n\nis circular but not without meaning. Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's Law of non-contradiction, a fundamental philosophical axiom. In this view, without self-reference, logic and mathematics become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.\n\nCircular references can appear in computer programming when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:\n\nFunction A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called. So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is. Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.\n\nThe entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever. This leads to what is technically known as a livelock. It also appears in spreadsheets when two cells require each other's result. For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed. (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference. It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)\n\nA circular reference represents a big problem in computing.\n\nIn ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See CREATE TABLE for PostgreSQL and DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.\n\nA distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output. The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.\n\nCircular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the Colebrook equation and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.\n\n"}

Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.\nCitation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available.

The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online.

Kennedy's assassination in 1963. From the early 1980s through 2004 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted about 2,500 analyses on cases submitted by law-enforcement groups. The results of these analyses had often been questioned by defence lawyers and the press, so the FBI finally asked the United States National Academy of Science's Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy to research the scientific merit of the process.\n\nIn 2004 the Board's study was summarized in \"Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence.\" The Board determined that the chemical analyses were being performed correctly and were probably sufficient to determine correlation between two bullets from separate sources (the analysis used plasma-optical emission spectroscopy to identify trace elements in the bullets). The report also concluded that the seven trace elements selected for the analyses (arsenic, antimony, tin, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium) are acceptable for sample correlation. The report finally concluded that the procedure is the best available method for such correlations. The greatest caveat in the report was that the statistical tests as applied by the FBI could cause confusion and misinterpretation when transmitted to prosecutors or when explained to a trial jury. Because of the significance of this weakness, the report concluded that the analysis should be used with caution. This report helped the FBI decide in 2004 to voluntarily cease offering the analysis to law-enforcement entities. The National Academy of Sciences never required that the FBI stop using the test.\n\n\"CNN PRESENTS Encore Presentation: Reasonable Doubt\" examined the unreliability of this technique. It has been discontinued as of September 1, 2005.\n\nThe U.S. government has fought releasing the list of the estimated 2,500 cases over three decades in which it performed the analysis, which may have led to false convictions. According to the FBI, only 20% of the 2,500 tests performed introduced the CBLA results into evidence at trial.\n\nOn 17 December 2008, Jimmy Ates was released from a Florida prison after serving ten years on the conviction of having murdered his wife, a conviction obtained largely on the strength of a bullet-lead analysis.

Similarly, gene activity in the human brain is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Brain Science (see link below), yielding the freely available Allen Brain Atlas. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of comparative genomics. Increasing emphasis in psychology and ethology on the biological aspects of perception and behavior is bridging the gap between genomics and behavioral analysis.\n\nIn order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals.

{"id": "9435784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9435784", "title": "Comparative physiology", "text": "Comparative physiology\n\nComparative physiology is a subdiscipline of physiology that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of organisms. It is closely related to evolutionary physiology and environmental physiology. Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to Clifford Ladd Prosser, \"Comparative Physiology\nis not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy.\"\n\nOriginally, physiology focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve medical practices. When physiologists first began comparing different species it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles. This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the Krogh Principle.\n\nC. Ladd Prosser, a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in Garland and Carter):\n\n1. To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.\n\n2. The use of physiological information to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of organisms.\n\n3. To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.\n\n4. To identify \"model systems\" for studying particular physiological functions.\n\n5. To use the \"kind of animal\" as an experimental variable.\n\nComparative physiologists often study organisms that live in \"extreme\" environments (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation. One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.\n\nSimilarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to \"unusual\" organisms, such as very large or small ones. As an example, of the latter, hummingbirds have been studied. As another example, giraffe have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of blood pressure. More generally, ectothermic vertebrates have been studied to determine how blood acid-base balance and pH change as body temperature changes.\n\nIn the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\nA number of scientific societies feature sections on comparative physiology, including:\n\nKnut Schmidt-Nielsen (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at Duke University for many years and training a large number of students (obituary). He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.\n\nGrover C. Stephens (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the University of Minnesota until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the University of California at Irvine in 1964. He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field (obituary). He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "380406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380406", "title": "Comparative psychology", "text": "Comparative psychology\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.\n\nComparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single organism to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both proximate and ultimate causation. \n\nUsing a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen. First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.\n\nThird, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see Tinbergen's four questions.\n\nThe 9th century scholar al-Jahiz wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants. The 11th century Arabic writer Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the \"Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals\", an early treatise dealing with the effects of music on an imals. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of music, and shows other examples of how music can affect animal behavior, experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the Western world continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.\n\nCharles Darwin was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of \"pre-\" and \"post-Darwin\" because his contributions were so influential. theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the \"anecdotal movement\" led by George Romanes who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a \"rudimentary human mind\". Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. Douglas Alexander Spalding was called the \"first experimental biologist\", and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. Jacques Loeb emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, Sir John Lubbock is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and Conwy Lloyd Morgan is thought to be \"the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word\".\n\nThroughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term \"comparative psychology\" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.\n\nA persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare. However, the definition of \"intelligence\" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems. In the literature, \"intelligence\" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. echolocation). Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).\n\nA wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. Ivan Pavlov's early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. Thorndike began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical rat, which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.\n\nSkinner introduced the use of pigeons, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of primate; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by Harry F. Harlow's studies of maternal deprivation in rhesus monkeys. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named Gua was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.\n\nNonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee Washoe 350 words in American Sign Language. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, Loulis. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated. All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.\n\nInterest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be intelligent have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of corvid, parrots — especially the grey parrot — and dolphins. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg, who found that the African gray parrot Alex did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid found that a Border Collie named Chaser was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.\n\nResearchers who study animal cognition are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans. For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and animal cognition are heavily overlapping research categories.\n\nVeterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.\n\nCommon causes of disordered behavior in captive or pet animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, rats who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human psychosis, like biting their owners.\n\nThe way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the breed as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, huskies have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity. Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.\n\nThe systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on ethological studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.\n\nThe relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. Domestication has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.\nIngold remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as \"not people,\" and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: \"Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals.\" With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.\n\n\"The New York Times\" ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals, more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, \"It made the children more cooperative and sharing.\" It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.\n\nFurthermore, in an edition of \"Social Science and Medicine\" it was stated, \"A random survey of 339 residents from Perth, Western Australia were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales.\" Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.\n\nNoted comparative psychologists, in this broad sense, include:\n\nMany of these were active in fields other than animal psychology; this is characteristic of comparative psychologists.\n\nFields of psychology and other disciplines that draw upon, or overlap with, comparative psychology include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1719952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719952", "title": "Comparative research", "text": "Comparative research\n\nComparative research is a research methodology in the social sciences that aims to make comparisons across different countries or cultures. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of poverty).\n\nAs Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of \"episteme\" and \"philo-sophia\", as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. \"Episteme\", as a form and activity in the field of \"logos\", marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.\n\nMoreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic \"polis\". Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ \"Histories\" demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. \"isegoria\" and \"parrhesia\"), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.\n\nAccording also to Karl Deutsch, we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time. Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.\n\nTextbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after World War II. There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. Globalization has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. Information technology has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.\n\nComparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research. The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a \"seamless whole.\" \n\nThere are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data. The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful. \n\nSecondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent. A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.\n\nIn line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate \"grand theories,\" such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.\n\nComparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to. Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.\n\nThe historical comparative research involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.\n\nWhen it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2466507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2466507", "title": "Comparative sociology", "text": "Comparative sociology\n\nComparative sociology involves comparison of the social processes between nation states, or across different types of society (for example capitalist and socialist). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance. For example, structural Marxists have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies. The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.\n\nOne sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was Max Weber, whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" and Sociology of religion).\n\nThere is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. Emile Durkheim argued in \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called cross-national research.\n\n"}
{"id": "11797804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11797804", "title": "Comparison (grammar)", "text": "Comparison (grammar)\n\nComparison is a feature in the morphology or syntax of some languages, whereby adjectives and adverbs are inflected or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The comparative expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the superlative is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.\n\nThe grammatical category associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. The usual degrees of comparison are the \"positive\", which simply denotes a property (as with the English words \"big\" and \"fully\"); the \"comparative\", which indicates \"greater degree (as \"bigger\" and \"more fully\"); and the \"superlative\", which indicates \"greatest degree (as \"biggest\" and \"most fully\"). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. \"beautiful\", \"less beautiful\", \"least beautiful\".\n\nThe comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the \"-er\" suffix or modifying word \"more\" or \"less\" (e.g., \"faster\", \"more intelligent\", \"less wasteful\"); it can also, however, appear when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., \"more men than women\"). One preposition, \"near\", also has a superlative form, as in \"Find the restaurant nearest your house\".\n\nComparatives and superlatives may be formed morphologically, by inflection, as with the English and German \"-er\" and \"-(e)st\" forms, or syntactically, as with the English \"more...\" and \"most...\" and the French \"plus...\" and \"le plus...\" forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as \"better\" and \"best\" (from \"good\") and \"less\" and \"least\" (from \"little/few\") in English, and \"meilleur\" (from \"bon\") and \"mieux\" (from the adverb \"bien\") in French.\n\nMost if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.\n\nComparatives are often used with a conjunction or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with \"than\" in English, \"als\" in German, etc. In Russian and Greek (Ancient, Koine and Modern) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the genitive case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in \"the best swimmer out of all the girls\".\n\nLanguages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include \"as... as\" and \"less/least...\".\n\nА few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is Bulgarian, where expressions like \"по̀ човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)\" (literally \"more person\", \"most person\", \"less person\" but normally \"better kind of a person\", \"best kind of person\", \"not that good kind of a person\") and \"по̀ обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)\" (\"I like more\", \"I like the least\") are quite usual.\n\nIn many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, \"May the better man win\" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form \"May the best man win\" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.\n\nIn some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common rhetorical device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes considered ungrammatical.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnglish has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs \"more\" and \"most\".\n\nAs a general rule, words with one syllable require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require \"more\" or \"most\", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, \"e.g.\" 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.\n\nMorphological comparison uses the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"). These inflections are of Germanic origin and are cognate with the Latin suffixes -\"ior\" and -\"issimus\" and Ancient Greek -\"īōn\" and -\"istos\". They are typically added to shorter words, words of Anglo-Saxon origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these inflections have fewer than three syllables.\n\nThis system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like \"good\", \"better\", and \"best\", contain suppletive forms. These irregular forms include:\n\nThe second system of comparison in English appends the grammatical particles \"more\" and \"most\", themselves the irregular comparatives of \"many\" and \"much\", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the diminutives \"less\" and \"least\".\n\nThis system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than \"-ly\" (e.g., \"beautiful\"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:\n\nSome adjectives, the absolute or ungradable adjectives do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either \"present\" or \"absent\", such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything \"very Cretaceous\", or to characterize something as \"more igneous\" than something else.\n\nSome grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as \"full\", \"complete\", \"unique\", or \"empty\", which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute. However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a figurative than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nMany prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as \"more perfect\", \"most unique\", and \"most parallel\" as illogical pleonasms: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be \"very unique\", or \"more unique\" than something else.\n\nOther style guides argue that terms like \"perfect\" and \"parallel\" never apply \"exactly\" to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean \"nearly perfect\", \"nearly parallel\", and so on; in this sense, \"more perfect\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and \"more parallel\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.\n\nIn most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.\n\nIn Bulgarian, comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics \"по-\" (\"more\") and \"най-\" (\"most\"):\n\nIn Czech, Polish, Slovak and Slovene, comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).\n\nIn Russian, comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:\n\nIn contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. \"the most beautiful\") and absolute (e.g. \"very beautiful\").\n\nFrench: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (\"mon\", \"ton\", \"son\", etc.), before \"plus\" or \"moins\" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: \"Elle est la plus belle femme\" → (she is the most beautiful woman); \"Cette ville est la moins chère de France\" → (this town is the least expensive in France); \"C'est sa plus belle robe\" → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix \"-issime\" but only with certain words, for example: \"C'est un homme richissime\" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.\n\nPortuguese and Italian distinguish comparative superlative \"(superlativo relativo)\" and absolute superlative \"(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).\nFor the comparative superlative they use the words \"mais\" and \"più\" between the article and the adjective, like \"most\" in English.\nFor the absolute superlative they either use \"muito\"/\"molto\" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding \"issimo\" (singular masculine), \"issima\" (singular feminine), \"íssimos\"/\"issimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íssimas\"/\"issime\" (plural feminine). For example:\nThere are some irregular forms for some words ending in \"-re\" and \"-le\" (deriving from Latin words ending in \"-er\" and \"-ilis\") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending \"-re\" and they gain the endings \"errimo\" (singular masculine), \"errima\" (singular feminine), \"érrimos\"/\"errimi\" (plural masculine), or \"érrimas\"/\"errime\" (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the \"-l\"/\"-le\" ending and gain \"ílimo\"/\"illimo\" (singular masculine), \"ílima\"/\"illima\" (singular feminine), \"ílimos\"/\"illimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íli\nRomanian, similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word \"mai\" before the adjective, which operates like \"more\" or \"-er\" in English. For example: \"luminos\" → bright, \"mai luminos\" → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word \"puțin\" (little) is added between \"mai\" and the adjective, for example \"mai puțin luminos\" → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant \"cel\" precedes \"mai,\" conjugated as \"cel / cei\" for male singular / plural and \"cea / cele\" for female singular / plural. For example: \"cea mai luminoasă stea\" → the brightest star; \"cele mai frumoase fete\" → the most beautiful girls; \"cel mai mic morcov\" → the smallest carrot.\n\nScottish Gaelic: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an \"e\" to the end and \"i\" before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by \"nas\" to say \"more,\" and \"as\" to say \"most.\" (The word \"na\" is used to mean \"than\".) Adjectives that begin with \"f\" are lenited. and \"as\" use different syntax constructions. For example:\nTha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.\" → I am taller than my sisters.\nIs mi as àirde.\" → I am the tallest.\n\nAs in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.\n\nIn other tenses, \"nas\" is replaced by \"na bu\" and \"as\" by \"a bu,\" both of which lenite the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an \"f\" followed by a vowel, the word \"bu\" is reduced to \"b\"'. For example:\n\n\nWelsh is similar to English in many respects. The ending \"-af\" is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English \"-est\", and with (most) long words \"mwyaf\" precedes it, as in the English \"most\". Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular. Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative \"must\" be used, e.g. of two people - \"John ydy'r talaf\" (John is the tallest).\n\nIn Akkadian cuneiform, (on a 12 paragraph clay tablet), from the time period of the 1350 BC Amarna letters (a roughly 20-year body of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral \"10,\" as well as \"7 and 7.\" The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.\n\nThe term \"7 and 7\" means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds \"more\" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, \"Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):\" \"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times\" more, \"...\". The word 'more' is Akkadian \"mila\", and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is \"...over and over again, overflowing,\" (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).\n\nThe numeral 10 is used for \"ten times greater\" in EA 19, \"Love and Gold\", one of King Tushratta's eleven letters to the Pharaoh-(Amenhotep IV-\"Akhenaton\"). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):\n\nThe actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, \"to light up, to rise\"), uses: -e-le-né-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: \"...may it be, flourish-our (relations).\"\n\nIn Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with \"kõige\" followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of \"sinine\" 'blue' is \"sinisem\" and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is \"kõige sinisem\". There is also a synthetic (\"short\") superlative form, which is formed by adding \"-m\" to the end of the plural partitive case. For \"sinine\" the plural partitive form is \"siniseid\" and so \"siniseim\" is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the \"kõige\"-form, has a lot of exceptions.\n\n"}

{"id": "1338683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1338683", "title": "Corecursion", "text": "Corecursion\n\nIn computer science, corecursion is a type of operation that is dual to recursion. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is \"generative recursion\" which may lack a definite \"direction\" inherent in corecursion and recursion.\n\nWhere recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as streams, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of \"finite\" steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-\"productive\". Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example recurrence relations such as the factorial.\n\nCorecursion can produce both finite and infinite data structures as results, and may employ self-referential data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation, to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in functional programming, where corecursion and codata allow total languages to work with infinite data structures.\n\nCorecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the generator facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and assigned values imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.\n\nA classic example of recursion is computing the factorial, which is defined recursively by \"0! := 1\" and \"n! := n × (n - 1)!\".\n\nTo \"recursively\" compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) \"itself\" with a different (\"smaller\" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the \"base case\" has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute \"fac(3)\", this recursively calls in turn \"fac(2)\", \"fac(1)\", \"fac(0)\" (\"winding up\" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with \"fac(0) = 1\", and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame \"fac(3)\" that uses the result of \"fac(2) = 2\" to calculate the final result as \"3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)\" and finally return \"fac(3) = 6\". In this example a function returns a single value.\n\nThis stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial \"corecursively\", as an iterator, where one \"starts\" with the case of formula_1, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers \"1, 2, 3...\" as in the above recursive definition with \"time arrow\" reversed, as it were, by reading it \"backwards\" as The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a \"stream\" of \"all\" factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a generator. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both \"n\" and \"f\" (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:\nor in Haskell, \n\nmeaning, \"starting from formula_3, on each step the next values are calculated as formula_4\". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the formula_5 emphasizes that the factorial values are being built \"up\", going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, \"down\" to the base case, with a formula_6 decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial formula_7 values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index \"n\" in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.\n\nNote the connection with denotational semantics, where the denotations of recursive programs is built up corecursively in this way.\n\nIn Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:\n\nThis could then be called for example as codice_1 to compute \"5!\".\n\nA corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:\n\nThis generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:\n\nThis could then be called to produce the factorials up to \"5!\" via:\n\nIf we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,\n\nAs can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting codice_2 for the only codice_3 there) to the accumulator argument technique for tail recursion, unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.\n\nIn the same way, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as:\nNote that because the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the formula_9 corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the formula_10 corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using parallel assignment):\n\nIn Haskell, \n\nTree traversal via a depth-first approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, breadth-first traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.\n\nWithout using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure. If the data structure is a stack (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and if the data structure is a queue (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.\n\nUsing recursion, a (post-order) depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.\n\nUsing corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value, then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the \"whole list\" of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc. In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, \"n\") was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of \"n\"!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:\nmeaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, \nThese can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a \"leaf node\" (at the \"bottom\") as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and \"analyzes\" a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off \"below\"). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a \"root node\" (at the \"top\") as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being \"synthesized\" of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off \"above\"). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.\n\nNotably, given an infinite tree, the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.\n\nIn Python, this can be implemented as follows.\nThe usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:\n\nThis can then be called by codice_4 to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.\n\nThe breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:\n\nThis can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:\n\nInitial data types can be defined as being the least fixpoint (up to isomorphism) of some type equation; the isomorphism is then given by an initial algebra. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the greatest fixpoint of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final coalgebra.\n\nIf the domain of discourse is the category of sets and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, non-wellfounded values, whereas initial types do not. On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of complete partial orders and continuous functions, which corresponds roughly to the Haskell programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.\n\nCorecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary recursion recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.\n\nThe discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell. Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.\n\nThe rule for \"primitive corecursion\" on codata is the dual to that for primitive recursion on data. Instead of descending on the argument by pattern-matching on its constructors (that \"were called up before\", somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. \"fields\"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its \"destructors\" (or \"observers\", that \"will be called afterwards\", somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion \"creates\" (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion \"analyses\" (necessarily finite) data. Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate. Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.\n\nIn \"Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes\" we find\n\nwhere primes \"are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)\". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as \nor in Haskell, \n\nThe authors discuss how the definition of codice_5 is not guaranteed always to be \"productive\", and could become stuck e.g. if called with codice_6 as the initial stream.\n\nHere is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of Fibonacci numbers in linear time:\nThis infinite list depends on lazy evaluation; elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.\n\nThis can be done in Python as well:\nThe definition of codice_7 can be inlined, leading to this:\n\nThis example employs a self-referential \"data structure\". Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential \"functions\", but does not accommodate self-referential data. However, this is not essential to the Fibonacci example. It can be rewritten as follows:\n\nThis employs only self-referential \"function\" to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with non-strict list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.\n\nCorecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue is a particularly good example of this phenomenon. The following definition produces a breadth-first traversal of a binary tree in linear time:\n\nThis definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees. This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result ( produces its output notches after its input back-pointer, , along the ). It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite. The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination; this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees. \n\nAnother particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling. The function codice_8 visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion, and replaces each label with an integer, each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one. This solution employs a self-referential data structure, and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.\n\nAn apomorphism (such as an anamorphism, such as unfold) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a paramorphism (such as a catamorphism, such as fold) is a form of recursion.\n\nThe Coq proof assistant supports corecursion and coinduction using the CoFixpoint command.\n\nCorecursion, referred to as \"circular programming,\" dates at least to , who credits John Hughes and Philip Wadler; more general forms were developed in . The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.\n\n\n"}

It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.\n\nA broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.\n\nThere is also a contrast between \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\" dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. \"informal\" or \"vulgar\") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.\n\nAlthough the first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of \"astonishing\" lack of method and critical-self reflection.\n\nThe oldest known dictionaries were Akkadian Empire cuneiform tablets with bilingual Sumerian–Akkadian wordlists, discovered in Ebla (modern Syria) and dated roughly 2300 BCE. The early 2nd millennium BCE \"Urra=hubullu\" glossary is the canonical Babylonian version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A Chinese dictionary, the c. 3rd century BCE \"Erya\", was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE Shizhoupian as a \"dictionary\", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of Chinese characters from Zhou dynasty bronzes. Philitas of Cos (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary \"Disorderly Words\" (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, \"\") which explained the meanings of rare Homeric and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms. Apollonius the Sophist (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon. The first Sanskrit dictionary, the Amarakośa, was written by Amara Sinha c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", the first Japanese dictionary was the long-lost 682 CE \"Niina\" glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE \"Tenrei Banshō Meigi\", was also a glossary of written Chinese. In \"Frahang-i Pahlavig\", Aramaic heterograms are listed together with their translation in Middle Persian language and phonetic transcription in Pazand alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, Sanas Cormaic, contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, Amir Khusro compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with Hindustani and Persian words.\nArabic dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the \"Lisan al-`Arab\" (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and \"al-Qamus al-Muhit\" (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The \"Qamus al-Muhit\" is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the \"Lisan\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nIn medieval Europe, glossaries with equivalents for Latin words in vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The \"Catholicon\" (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino's \"Dictionarium\" was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\", which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by Sebastián Covarrubias' \"Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española\", published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the \"Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca\", for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the \"Dictionnaire Universel\" by Antoine Furetière for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie française\". Between 1712 and 1721 was published the \"Vocabulario portughez e latino\" written by Raphael Bluteau. The Real Academia Española published the first edition of the \"Diccionario de la lengua española\" in 1780, but their \"Diccionario de Autoridades\", which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The \"Totius Latinitatis lexicon\" by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.\n\nThe first edition of \"A Greek-English Lexicon\" by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches Wörterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the \"Dizionario della lingua italiana\" by Niccolò Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of \"A magyar nyelv szótára\" (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. Émile Littré published the Dictionnaire de la langue française between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl published the \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language\". The Duden dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the \"Svenska Akademiens ordbok\" was taken in 1787.\n\nThe earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word \"dictionary\" was invented by an Englishman called John of Garland in 1220 — he had written a book \"Dictionarius\" to help with Latin \"diction\". An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the \"Elementarie\", created by Richard Mulcaster in 1582.\n\nThe first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written by English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is \"a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.\" \n\nIn 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his \"English Expositor\". \"Glossographia\" by Thomas Blount, published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. Edward Phillips wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled \"The New World of English Words: Or a General Dictionary\" which boldly plagiarized Blount's work, and the two denounced each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. John Wilkins' 1668 essay on philosophical language contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by William Lloyd. Elisha Coles published his \"English Dictionary\" in 1676.\n\nIt was not until Samuel Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy. By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first \"modern\" dictionary.\n\nJohnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the Oxford University Press began writing and releasing the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in short fascicles from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete \"OED\" in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, William Chester Minor, a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.\n\nIn 1806, American Noah Webster published his first dictionary, \"\". In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language;\" it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit.\n\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced American English spellings, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", substituting \"wagon\" for \"waggon\", and printing \"center\" instead of \"centre\". He also added American words, like \"skunk\" and \"squash\", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.\n\nIn a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.\n\nIn many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the undeclined or unconjugated form appears as the headword in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like StarDict and the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" are dictionary software running on PDAs or computers. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the Internet.\n\nAccording to the \"Manual of Specialized Lexicographies\", a specialized dictionary, also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in \"The Bilingual LSP Dictionary\", lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between \"minimizing dictionaries\" and \"maximizing dictionaries\", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, \"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\" and \"Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms\") whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (\"The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\").\n\nAnother variant is the glossary, an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine (medical dictionary).\n\nThe simplest dictionary, a defining dictionary, provides a core glossary of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English idioms and metaphors, can be defined.\n\nLexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\". Noah Webster, intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why American English now uses the spelling \"color\" while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers \"colour\". (Similarly, British English subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at American and British English spelling differences.)\n\nLarge 20th-century dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) and \"Webster's Third\" are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. \"Merriam-Webster\" is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, \"sometimes offensive\" or \"stand\" (nonstandard). \"American Heritage\" goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous \"usage notes.\" \"Encarta\" provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, \"an offensive term for...\" or \"a taboo term meaning...\".\n\nBecause of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to \"El otro, el mismo\": \"It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.\"\n\nSometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the \"Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary\" is \"at war with itself\": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as \"hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít\" (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas \"hi taharóg otí\", literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.\n\nA historical dictionary is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.\n\nIn contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.\n\n\nIn many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word \"dictionary\" might be followed by the International Phonetic Alphabet spelling . American English dictionaries often use their ownpronunciation respelling systems with diacritics, for example \"dictionary\" is respelled as \"dĭk′shə-nĕr′ē\" in the American Heritage Dictionary. The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, \"dictionary\" may be respelled as . Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.\n\nHistories and descriptions of the dictionaries of other languages on Wikipedia include:\n\n\nThe age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. David Skinner in 2013 noted that \"Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.' Teaching users about words they don’t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well.\"\nThere exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of neologisms. Some of the more notable examples include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1902180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1902180", "title": "Digital reference", "text": "Digital reference\n\nDigital reference (or virtual reference) is a service by which a library reference service is conducted online, and the reference transaction is a computer-mediated communication. It is the remote, NextNextcomputer-mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word \"reference\" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using reference works, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a \"virtual\" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations.\n\nThe terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition. The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is \"virtual reference\", with the secondary non-preferred term \"digital reference\" having gone out of use in recent years. \"Chat reference\" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, \"synchronous virtual reference\" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.\n\nThe earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by e-mail. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology.\n\nWith the advent of the graphical World Wide Web, libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email.\n\nIn the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as \"AskA\" services. Examples of AskA services are the Internet Public Library, Ask Dr. Math, and Ask Joan of Art.\n\nProviding remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years. For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries. Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services. \nThe rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services. Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current cyberculture and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the \"Google Generation\", of users who have grown up with the internet. For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded Web 2.0 (online social media such as Facebook, YouTube, blogs, del.icio.us, Flickr, etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services. As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users.\n\nThe range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.\n\nWebforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question. This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for. Creation of webforms requires design consideration. Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function.\n\nAspects commonly found within webforms:\n\n\nSeveral applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Some of these applications are: QuestionPoint, OmniReference, Tutor.com, LibraryH3lp, AspiringKidz.com, and Vienova.com. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk applications. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co-browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre-scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting.\n\nInstant messaging (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free. Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet. This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian. On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron. IM reference services may be for the use of in-house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public.\n\nSuccessful IM reference services will:\n\nAt times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.\n\nThe article Live, Digital Reference Marketplace by Buff Hirko contains a comparison of the features of applications for chat-based reference.\n\nSee the entries in the Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section, including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference.\n\nVirtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs. However, each program may have several distinct features. A knowledge base is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of frequently asked questions (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure.\n\nOnline chat, or instant messaging (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature. Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language. Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff.\n\nThe use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years. Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat. In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response.\n\nWith the increase in use of text messaging (Short Message Service or SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. Librarians can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging.\n\nCo-browsing, or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images.\n\nVirtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services. A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service.\n\nUK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995, in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK-wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide), and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council), and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. It uses the Online Computer Library Center's QuestionPoint software.\n\nThe definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components:\n\n\nIn January 2011 QuestionPoint and the American Library Association were in talks about offering a National Ask A Librarian service across the whole United States of America. At present the Ask services in the US are run at a local level.\n\nIn Europe some countries offer services in both their own national language and in English. European countries include: Finland, the Netherlands (in Dutch only), Denmark, and France.\n\nOther countries which offer virtual reference services include: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the state of Colorado in the United States.\n\nA collaboration between UK and Australian library services, entitled Chasing the Sun, has been initiated using QuestionPoint software so that an all-hours digital reference chat service can be offered. Targeted at health libraries where reference queries from health professionals could occur at any time of the day or night due to medical emergencies, the collaboration between the two countries means that someone will be on hand to field the query at any time. Although the UK libraries involved are currently based in England the programme may expand to other countries and health services if successful.\n\n\n\n\nThe following provide software and technology infrastructure for digital/virtual reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "500948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=500948", "title": "Field guide", "text": "Field guide\n\nA field guide is a book designed to help the reader identify wildlife (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. minerals). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects. Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.\n\nIt will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include identification keys to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.\n\nPopular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 \"How to Know the Wildflowers\" by \"Mrs. William Starr Dana\" (Frances Theodora Parsons). In 1890, Florence Merriam published \"Birds Through an Opera-Glass\", describing 70 common species. Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides. In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist Vernon Bailey), she published \"Handbook of Birds of the Western United States\". By contrast, the \"Handbook\" is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by taxonomic order and had clear descriptions of species size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.\n\nFrom this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by Chester A. Reed and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.\n\nIn 1934, Roger Tory Peterson, using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the \"Peterson Identification System\", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from animal tracks to seashells and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.\n\nToday, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization. Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the Audubon Society, the RSPB, the Field Studies Council, National Geographic, HarperCollins, and many others all produce quality field guides.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.\n\nFor general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.\n\nGuides for students often introduce the concept of identification keys. Plant field guides such as \"Newcomb's Wildflower Guide\" (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search. Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.\n\nMany taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:\n\nField guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.\n\n"}

Volumes on particular topics were published from the 1960s and 1970s under the general editorship of Robert Wauchope. Separate volumes with particular volume editors deal with a number of general topics, including archeology, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, linguistics, with the last four substantive volumes treating various topics in Mesoamerican ethnohistory, under the editorship of Howard F. Cline. Select volumes have become available in e-book format.\n\nA retrospective review of the HMAI by two anthropologists discusses its history and evaluates it. One review calls it a fundamental work. Another reviewer says \"since the first volume of the HMAI appeared in 1964 is far and away the most comprehensive and erudite coverage of native cultures of any region in the Americas.\" A review in the journal \"Science\" says that \"There can be little doubt that, like the \"Handbook of South American Indians\", this monumental synthesis will provide a sound basis for new generalizations and will stimulate additional research to fill the gaps in knowledge and understanding that will become apparent.\n\nStarting in 1981, six volumes in the Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians were published under the general editorship of Victoria Bricker.\n\nVolume 1.

{"id": "4807639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4807639", "title": "Microsoft Bookshelf", "text": "Microsoft Bookshelf\n\nMicrosoft Bookshelf was a reference collection introduced in 1987 as part of Microsoft's extensive work in promoting CD-ROM technology as a distribution medium for electronic publishing. The original MS-DOS version showcased the massive storage capacity of CD-ROM technology, and was accessed while the user was using one of 13 different word processor programs that Bookshelf supported. Subsequent versions were produced for Windows and became a commercial success as part of the Microsoft Home brand. It was often bundled with personal computers as a cheaper alternative to the Encarta Suite. The Encarta Deluxe Suite / Reference Library versions also bundled Bookshelf.\n\nMicrosoft Bookshelf was discontinued in 2000. In later editions of the Encarta suite (Encarta 2000 and onwards), Bookshelf was replaced with a dedicated \"Encarta Dictionary\", a superset of the printed edition. There has been some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in Bookshelf which many found to be a useful reference, such as the dictionary of quotations (replaced with a quotations section in \"Encarta\" that links to relevant articles and people) and the Internet Directory, although the directory is now a moot point since many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist.\n\nThe original 1987 edition contained \"The Original Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases\", \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", World Almanac and Book of Facts, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, The Chicago Manual of Style (13th Edition), the U.S. ZIP Code Directory, Houghton Mifflin Usage Alert, Houghton Mifflin Spelling Verifier and Corrector, Business Information Sources, and Forms and Letters. Titles in non-US versions of Bookshelf were different. For example, the 1997 UK edition included the Chambers Dictionary, Bloomsbury Treasury of Quotations, and Hutchinson Concise Encyclopedia.\n\nThe Windows release of Bookshelf added a number of new reference titles, including \"The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia\" and an Internet Directory. Other titles were added and some were dropped in subsequent years. By 1994, the English-language version also contained the \"Columbia Dictionary of Quotations\"; \"The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia\"; the \"Hammond Intermediate World Atlas\"; and \"The People's Chronology\". By 2000, the collection came to include the \"Encarta Desk Encyclopedia\", the \"Encarta Desk Atlas\", the \"Encarta Style Guide\" and a specialized \"Computer and Internet Dictionary\" by Microsoft Press.\n\nBookshelf 1.0 used a proprietary hypertext engine that Microsoft acquired when it bought the company Cytation in 1986. Also used for Microsoft Stat Pack and Microsoft Small Business Consultant, it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program that ran alongside a dominant program, unbeknownst to the dominant program. Like Apple's similar Hypercard reader, Bookshelf engine's files used a single compound document, containing large numbers of subdocuments (\"cards\" or \"articles\"). They both differ from current browsers which normally treat each \"page\" or \"article\" as a separate file.\n\nThough similar to Apple's Hypercard reader in many ways, the Bookshelf engine had several key differences. Unlike Hypercard files, Bookshelf files required compilation and complex markup codes. This made the files more difficult to pirate, addressing a key concern of early electronic publishers. Furthermore, Bookshelf's engine was designed to run as fast as possible on slow first-generation CD-ROM drives, some of which required as much as a half-second to move the drive head. Such hardware constraints made Hypercard impractical for high-capacity CD-ROMs. Bookshelf also had full text searching capability, which made it easy to find needed information.\n\nCollaborating with DuPont, the Microsoft CD-ROM division developed a Windows version of its engine for applications as diverse as document management, online help, and a CD-ROM encyclopedia. In a skunkworks project, these developers worked secretly with Multimedia Division developers so that the engine would be usable for more ambitious multimedia applications. Thus they integrated a multimedia markup language, full text search, and extensibility using software objects, all of which are commonplace in modern internet browsing.\n\nIn 1992, Microsoft started selling the Bookshelf engine to third-party developers, marketing the product as Microsoft Multimedia Viewer. The idea was that such a tool would help a burgeoning growth of CD-ROM titles that would spur demand for Windows. Although the engine had multimedia capabilities that would not be matched by Web browsers until the late 1990s, Microsoft Viewer did not enjoy commercial success as a standalone product. However, Microsoft continued to use the engine for its Encarta and WinHelp applications, though the multimedia functions are rarely used in Windows help files.\n\nIn 1993, the developers who were working on the next generation viewer were moved to the Cairo systems group which was charged with delivering Bill Gates' 'vision' of 'Information at your fingertips'. This advanced browser was a fully componentized application using what are now known as Component Object Model objects, designed for hypermedia browsing across large networks and whose main competitor was thought to be Lotus Notes. Long before Netscape appeared, this team, known as the WEB (web enhanced browser) team had already shipped a network capable hypertext browser capable of doing everything that HTML browsers would not be able to do until the turn of the century. Nearly all technologies of Cairo shipped. The WEB browser was not one of them, though it influenced the design of many other common Microsoft technologies.\n\n\"BYTE\" in 1989 listed Microsoft Bookshelf as among the \"Excellence\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it \"is the first substantial application of CD-ROM technology\" and \"a harbinger of personal library systems to come\".\n\n"}
{"id": "10550174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10550174", "title": "Observer's Books", "text": "Observer's Books\n\nThe Observer's Books were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by Frederick Warne & Co in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds. \n\nThe books were produced with paper dust covers up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as \"Glossies\". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.\n\nThe first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds. This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.\n\nIn 1942 a special edition book was brought out on \"airplanes\" . This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes. It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. \n\nThe first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like \"Aircraft\", \"Automobiles\" and \"Railway Locomotives\" proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. \n\nWhen Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).\n\nAfter a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled \"Observer's Book of Observer's Books\" in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of \"Wayside and Woodland\" in 2003.\n"}

{"id": "25407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25407", "title": "Recursion", "text": "Recursion\n\nRecursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:\n\nFor example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nMany mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the natural numbers by the Peano axioms can be described as: \"0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.\" By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.\n\nRecursively defined mathematical objects include functions, sets, and especially fractals.\n\nThere are various more tongue-in-cheek \"definitions\" of recursion; see recursive humor.\n\nRecursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.\n\nTo understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps. An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.\n\nRecursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a sourdough recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a maze. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.\n\nLinguist Noam Chomsky among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language. This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: \"Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous\", in which the sentence \"witches are dangerous\" occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.\n\nThis provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: \"Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...\". There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.\n\nRecently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by Daniel Everett on the basis of his claims about the Pirahã language. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this. Literary self-reference can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.\n\nRecursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in natural language semantics. The word \"and\", for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, \"and\" is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one. \n\nA recursive grammar is a formal grammar that contains recursive production rules.\n\nRecursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a circular definition or self-reference, in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an infinite regress. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their glossary along the lines of:\n\nA variation is found on page 269 in the index of some editions of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language\"; the index entry recursively references itself (\"recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269\"). The earliest version of this joke was in \"Software Tools\" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in \"The UNIX Programming Environment\" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of \"The C Programming Language\".\n\nAnother joke is that \"To understand recursion, you must understand recursion.\" In the English-language version of the Google web search engine, when a search for \"recursion\" is made, the site suggests \"Did you mean: \"recursion\".\" An alternative form is the following, from Andrew Plotkin: \"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to Douglas Hofstadter than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is.\"\n\nRecursive acronyms can also be examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator.\" and GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\".\n\nThe canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the natural numbers:\n\nAnother interesting example is the set of all \"true reachable\" propositions in an axiomatic system.\n\n\nThis set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also Gödel's incompleteness theorems.\n\nFinite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create fractal-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the Cantor set is a subdivision rule, as is barycentric subdivision.\n\nA function may be partly defined in terms of itself. A familiar example is the Fibonacci number sequence: \"F\"(\"n\") = \"F\"(\"n\" − 1) + \"F\"(\"n\" − 2). For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case \"F\"(0) = 0 and \"F\"(1) = 1.\n\nA famous recursive function is the Ackermann function, which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.\n\nApplying the standard technique of proof by cases to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields structural induction, a powerful generalization of mathematical induction widely used to derive proofs in mathematical logic and computer science.\n\nDynamic programming is an approach to optimization that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the Bellman equation, which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).\n\nIn set theory, this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist. Given a set \"X\", an element \"a\" of \"X\" and a function formula_7, the theorem states that there is a unique function formula_8 (where formula_4 denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that\nfor any natural number \"n\".\n\nTake two functions formula_8 and formula_13 such that:\n\nwhere \"a\" is an element of \"X\".\n\nIt can be proved by mathematical induction that formula_18 for all natural numbers \"n\":\n\nBy induction, formula_18 for all formula_25.\n\nA common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a computer programming technique, this is called divide and conquer and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is dynamic programming. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.\n\nA classic example of recursion is the definition of the factorial function, given here in C code:\n\nIf not having reached the base case and returning with value every instantiation of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by (), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of , analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.\n\nRecursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in parsers for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.\n\nRecurrence relations are equations to define one or more sequences recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be \"solved\" to obtain a non-recursive definition.\n\nUse of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is usually simplicity. The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.\n\nThe Russian Doll or Matryoshka Doll is a physical artistic example of the recursive concept.\n\nRecursion has been used in paintings since Giotto's \"Stefaneschi Triptych\", made in 1320. Its central panel contains the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych itself as an offering.\n\nM. C. Escher's \"Print Gallery\" (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains the picture, and so \"ad infinitum\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8912106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8912106", "title": "Reference scenario", "text": "Reference scenario\n\nA reference scenario is an imagined situation where a library patron brings a question to a librarian and there is then a conversation, called in the field a reference interview, where the librarian works to help the patron find what he or she wants. These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons. Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.\n\nA great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions. This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions. Scenarios are something different. They focus the student on the interaction with patrons. In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.\n\nScenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start. Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer. Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand. Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide. This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23499848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23499848", "title": "Secondary source", "text": "Secondary source\n\nIn scholarship, a secondary source is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a primary source, which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. \n\nA secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. \nThe most accurate classification for any given source is not always obvious. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\" are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used. A third level, the tertiary source, such as an encyclopedia or dictionary, resembles a secondary source in that it contains analysis, but attempts to provide a broad introductory overview of a topic.\n\nInformation can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called symbolic sources. Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone. Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a midden, regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document. \n\nMany sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used. Moreover, the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents. Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.\n\nWhether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \"primary\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \"secondary\".\n\nAttempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further \"levels\". One such model is the UNISIST model of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.\n\nSome other modern languages use more than one word for the English word \"source\". German usually uses \"Sekundärliteratur\" (\"secondary literature\") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving \"Sekundärquelle\" (\"secondary source\") to historiography. A \"Sekundärquelle\" is a source which can tell about a lost \"Primärquelle\" (\"primary source\"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.\n\nIn general, secondary sources are self-described as review articles or meta-analysis.\n\nPrimary source materials are typically defined as \"original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study.\" An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in IMRAD style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study. In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature. A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.\n\nA book review that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book. A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.\n\nIn library and information sciences, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to primary sources in the context of the particular information or idea under study.\n\nAn important use of secondary sources in the field of mathematics has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public; in other sciences tertiary sources are expected to fulfill the introductory role.\n\nSecondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or scholarly journals, from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a peer reviewed article is always a secondary source.\nThe delineation of sources as primary and secondary first arose in the field of historiography, as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing. In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. In original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.\n\nFollowing the Rankean model established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use archives of primary sources. Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.\n\nIn the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the headnotes of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias. Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and precedential, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.\n\n\"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor.\" Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event \"when the fallibility of memory is an important factor\" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.\n\nAn autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in World War I written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28545", "title": "Self-reference", "text": "Self-reference\n\nSelf-reference occurs in natural or formal languages when a sentence, idea or formula refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some encoding. In philosophy, it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, the word \"I\" in English.\n\nSelf-reference is studied and has applications in mathematics, philosophy, computer programming, and linguistics. Self-referential statements are sometimes paradoxical, and can also be considered recursive.\n\nIn classical philosophy, paradoxes were created by self-referential concepts such as the omnipotence paradox of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The Epimenides paradox, 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.\n\nIn mathematics and computability theory, self-reference (also known as Impredicativity) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. Gödel's theorem uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. The halting problem equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as Russell's paradox and Berry's paradox, and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.\n\nIn game theory undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.\n\nIn computer programming, self-reference occurs in reflection, where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data. Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in recursion (related to the mathematical recurrence relation) in functional programming, where a code structure refers back to itself during computation. 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of computer science, and is now used routinely in, for example, writing compilers using the 'meta-language' ML. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as bootstrapping. Self-modifying code is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with assembler and with functional languages such as Lisp, but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in flip-flops, the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as GNU ('Gnu's not Unix') and PINE ('Pine is not Elm'). The GNU Hurd is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.\n\nTupper's self-referential formula is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.\n\nThe biology of self-replication is self-referential, as embodied by DNA and RNA replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational Game of life, and have inspired engineering systems such as the RepRap self-replicating 3d printer.\n\nSelf-reference occurs in literature and film when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\", Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"The Tempest\" and \"Twelfth Night\", Denis Diderot's \"Jacques le fataliste et son maître\", Italo Calvino's \"If on a winter's night a traveler\", many stories by Nikolai Gogol, \"Lost in the Funhouse\" by John Barth, Luigi Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" and Federico Fellini's \"8½\". Perhaps the earliest example is in Homer's Iliad, where Helen of Troy laments: \"for generations still unborn/we will live in song\" (appearing in the song itself).\n\nSelf-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of breaking the fourth wall and meta-reference, which often involve self-reference. The short stories of Jorge Luis Borges play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the rubber reality movement, notably in Charlie Kaufman's films Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.\n\nVarious creation myths invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the Egyptian creation myth has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. Ouroboros is a mythical dragon which eats itself.\n\nThe surrealist painter René Magritte is famous for his self-referential works. His painting \"The Treachery of Images\", includes the words \"this is not a pipe\", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word \"ceci\" (in English, \"this\") refers to the pipe depicted—or to the painting or the word or sentence itself. M.C. Escher's art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.\n\nA word that describes itself is called an \"autological word\" (or \"autonym\"). This generally applies to adjectives, for example sesquipedalian (i.e. \"sesquipedalian\" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as TLA, as a three-letter abbreviation for \"three-letter abbreviation\".\n\nA sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an autogram.\n\nThere is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. \"This is a sentence.\" can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However \"This sentence is false\" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential paradox. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. Kurt Gödel claimed to have found such a paradox in the US constitution at his citizenship ceremony.\n\nSelf-reference occasionally occurs in the media when it is required to write about itself, for example the BBC reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as Wikipedia's article on Wikipedia.\n\nFumblerules are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as \"Avoid cliches like the plague\" and \"Don't use no double negatives\". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by William Safire.\n\nSeveral academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example historiography (or \"meta-history\") is history's study of its own past; meta-sociology occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and meta-mathematics is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In law, self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around constitutional issues. (The game of nomic begins as a model of this process.) The prefix \"meta\" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.\n\n\n"}

In open nomenclature it indicates that available material or evidence suggests that the proposed species is \"related to\", has an \"affinity\" to, but is \"not identical to\", the species with the binomial name that follows. The Latin word \"affinis\" can be translated as \"closely related to\", or \"akin to\".\n\nAn author who inserts \"n.sp.,\" or \"sp. nov., aff\" before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously undescribed species, but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the holotype but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.\n\nAn example would be: a gastropod shell listed as \"Lucapina\" aff. \"aegis\" would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of \"Lucapina aegis\", but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling \"Lucapina aegis\". In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been described.\n\nThe use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as cf., sp., or ?, but the latter indicate that the species is \"uncertain\" rather than undescribed.\n\n"}

The main purpose of such reference works for users \"to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed\" – to quote Peter Mark Roget, architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.\n\nAlthough including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a dictionary, a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.\n\nIn library science and information science, thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models. Recently, thesauri have been implemented with Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).\n\nThe word \"thesaurus\" is derived from 16th-century New Latin, in turn from Latin \"thēsaurus\", which is the Latinisation of the Greek (\"thēsauros\"), \"treasure, treasury, storehouse\". The word \"thēsauros\" is of uncertain etymology. Douglas Harper derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι \"tithenai\", \"to put, to place.\" Robert Beekes rejected an Indo-European derivation and suggested a Pre-Greek suffix .\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term \"thesaurus\" was applied to any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" (1532), and the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\" (1572). The meaning \"collection of words arranged according to sense\" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and \"thesaurer\" is attested in Middle English for \"treasurer\".\n\nIn antiquity, Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In Sanskrit, the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. Eventhough Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, they have all been lost.\n\nThe first modern thesaurus was \"Roget's Thesaurus\", first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world. Entries in \"Roget's Thesaurus\" are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\nThesauri have been used to perform automatic word-sense disambiguation and text simplification for machine translation systems.\n\n"}

These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as \"etc.\" and \"Mrs.\" are not three-letter acronyms, but \"TLA\" is a TLA (an example of an autological abbreviation).\n\nMost three-letter abbreviations are \"initialisms\": all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in \"APA\" . Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in \"CAT scan\".\n\n\nThe exact phrase \"three-letter acronym\" appeared in the sociology literature in 1975. Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA. The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982. In 1988, in a paper titled \"On the cruelty of really teaching computer science\", eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote \n\"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA ...\" By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.\n\nThe number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or permutations) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.\n\nIn English, WWW is the longest possible TLA to pronounce, typically requiring nine syllables. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the acronym instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, \"www\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"dubdubdub\" in speech.\n\n\n"}

When applied to the unbounded positive range 0 ≤ \"y\", the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps. One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.\n\nThe constant \"k\" is a simple monochrome bitmap image of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17. If \"k\" is divided by 17, the least significant bit encodes the upper-right corner (\"k\", 0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "303405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303405", "title": "Universal set", "text": "Universal set\n\nIn set theory, a universal set is a set which contains all objects, including itself. In set theory as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a paradox (Russell's paradox) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.\n\nThere is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include V, U and ξ.\n\nZermelo–Fraenkel set theory and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the cumulative hierarchy, do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the axiom of regularity, and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.\n\nRussell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and other set theories that include Zermelo's axiom of comprehension.\nThis axiom states that, for any formula formula_1 and any set , there exists another set \nthat contains exactly those elements of that satisfy formula_3. If a universal set  existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then\nthere would also exist another set formula_4, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as Bertrand Russell observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.\n\nA second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the power set of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist. However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.\n\nThe difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.\n\nThere are set theories known to be consistent (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set does exist (and formula_5 is true). In these theories, Zermelo's axiom of comprehension does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of naive set theory is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a non-well-founded set theory.\nThe most widely studied set theory with a universal set is Willard Van Orman Quine's New Foundations. Alonzo Church and also published work on such set theories. Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,\n\nAnother example is positive set theory, where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the positive formulas (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.\n\nThe idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see universal quantifier). One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe and similar large collections as proper classes rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a universal class is that the universal class does not contain itself, because proper classes cannot be elements of other classes. Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.\n\nThe category of sets can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. \nAgain, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.\n\n\n"}
