# Categorization of Wikipedia articles

## Abstract
In this project we want to implement a solution that is capable of grouping Wikipedia articles based on the articles content or other features.  We want to find feasible metrics to cluster articles into differentcategories.  In the beginning we want to find very general categories e.g.  science,  politics,  sports,movies, etc. and if possible, we want specify the categories into more detail, e.g. football player, actionmovie, midterm election, etc.. For this approach we want to use clustering.Possible extension: After we created a cluster we want to find a way to propose tags of related clustersfor a new article which is not in the cluster itself
