Most of the show alternates between [[Aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]]s performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400&nbsp;mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The highest speed flown during an air show is 700&nbsp;mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back. belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the [[Delta Formation]].\n\nThe parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the ''high'' show is performed; in overcast conditions a ''low'' show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the ''flat'' show is presented. The ''high'' show requires at least an {{convert|8000|ft|m|-2|adj=on}} [[Ceiling (cloud)|ceiling]] and visibility of at least {{convert|3|nmi|km|0}} from the show's centerpoint.

The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots serve two to three years,<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members.

Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9 and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> After serving with the squadron, members return to fleet assignments.\n\nThe officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and flight records. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified. Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.gosportpensacola.com/gosport-03-02-2012.pdf |title=Gosport article, March 02, 2012, \"Blue Angels Seek Officer Applicants\", page 2 |publisher=Gosport NAS Pensacola Base Newspaper }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nApplicants \"rush\" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs, post-show activities, and social events. Rushes are asked to tell a joke prior to the brief and are graded by the team as part of the rigorous selection process. Team members vote in secret on the next year's members, with no accountability to the higher Navy authority why an applicant was or was not selected. Selections must be unanimous. There have been female and racial minority staff officers as official Blue Angel members. The most recent minority Blue Angel pilot was Lt.

Pilots of numbers 2\u20137 are Navy Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders, or Marine Corps Captains or Majors. The number 7 pilot narrates for a year, and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years, respectively. The number 3 pilot moves to the number 4 (slot) position for his second year. Blue Angel No. 4 serves as the demonstration safety officer, due largely to the perspective he is afforded from the slot position within the formation, as well as his status as a second-year demonstration pilot.\n\n===Commanding officer===\n[[File:Commander Eric Doyle.jpg|thumb|Commander Eric Doyle<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/team/officers.asp|title=Official Blue Angels Webpage|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\n\nCommander Eric C. Doyle is from League City, Texas and graduated from Texas A&M with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 1996. After college, Eric went to [[Officer Candidate School (United States Navy)|Officer Candidate School]] in Pensacola, Florida, where he was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy in December 1996.\n\nDoyle has accumulated more than 3,000 flight hours and has 600 carrier-arrested landings. His decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, seven Strike/Flight Air Medal, five Navy Commendation Medal, a Navy Achievement Medal and various personal, unit and service awards.  He joined the Blue Angels in September 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/team/officers.asp |title=Blue Angels webpage, Officers |last= |first= |date= |website= |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Training and weekly routine==\nAnnual winter training takes place at [[NAF El Centro]], California, where new and returning pilots hone skills learned in the fleet. During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, in order to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in [[Pensacola]], [[Florida]], in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting \"circle and arrival\" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a \"practice\" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is the Blues' day off.\n\nPilots maneuver the flight stick with their right hand and operate the throttle with their left. They do not wear [[G-suit]]s because the air bladders inside repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with that stability. To prevent blood from pooling in their legs, Blue Angel pilots have developed a method for tensing their muscles to prevent blood from pooling in their lower extremities, possibly rendering them unconscious.<ref name=\"ba_faq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|title=Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Blueangels.navy.mil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404171459/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|The original team insignia]]\n\nFormed as the ''Flight Exhibition Team'' in March 1946 at  [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville]], Florida by Chief of Naval Operations, [[Admiral Chester Nimitz]], in an effort to raise awareness of naval aviation and boost morale. The team performed their first flight demonstration on June 15, 1946 in [[Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat]] aircraft.  The squadron was officially redesignated as the ''United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron'' in December 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://a4skyhawk.org/3e/blues/blues.htm |title=  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326154653/http://a4skyhawk.org/3e/blues/blues.htm |archivedate=26 March 2012|deadurl=yes |accessdate=2012-03-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Blue Angels name was suggested by Right Wing Pilot Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll after reading about the  Blue Angel nightclub in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. The first official Blue Angels team insignia or \u201ccrest\u201d was designed in 1949 by Flight Leader Lt. Cmdr. Raleigh \"Dusty\" Rhodes. The aircraft silhouettes change as the team changes aircraft.<ref name=\"OFFICIAL\" />\n\nOriginally, demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering. The current shades of blue and yellow were adopted when the team transitioned to the Bearcat in 1946. For a single year, in 1949, the team performed in an all-yellow scheme with blue markings.<ref>Campbell, ''War Paint'', p. 171.</ref>\n\n===1940s===\nOn 24 April 1946, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin \"Butch\" Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, \"if anything happened, just the alligators would know\". The team's first demonstration before Navy officials took place on 10 May 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.\n\n[[File:F6F-5 Blue Angels NAN10 46.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]] in 1946]]\nOn 15 June Voris led a trio of [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]], specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at their Florida home base, [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]].<ref name=\"OFFICIAL\" /> The team employed a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the \"Beetle Bomb\". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the [[Spike Jones#Murdering the Classics|Spike Jones]]' ''Murdering the Classics'' series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the [[William Tell Overture]] as a thoroughbred horse race scene, with \"Beetle Bomb\" being the \"trailing horse\" in the lyrics.\n\nThe team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by \"keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career.\" The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]].\n\n[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat]]s in \"diamond\" formation in 1947]]\nOn 25 August 1946 the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat|Grumman F8F-1 Bearcat]]. In May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team and introduced the famous Diamond Formation, now considered the Blue Angels' trademark.\n\nIn 1949, the team acquired a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas R4D Skytrain]] for logistics to and from show sites. The team's SNJ was also replaced by a F8F-1 \"Bearcat\", painted yellow for the air combat routine, inheriting the \"Beetle Bomb\" nickname. The Blues transitioned to the straight-wing Grumman [[Grumman F9F Panther|Grumman F9F-2 Panther]] on 13 July 1949, wherein the F8F-1 \"Beetle Bomb\" was relegated to solo aerobatics before the main show, until it crashed on takeoff at a training show in Pensacola in 1950.\n\nTeam headquarters shifted from [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, to [[Naval Air Station Whiting Field|NAAS Whiting Field]], Florida, in the fall of 1949, announced 14 July 1949.<ref>Fort Walton, Florida, \"'''Blue Angels' To Pensacola \u2013 Navy Flight Exhibition Team Is Transferred''\", Playground News, Thursday 14 July 1949, Volume 4, Number 24, page 2.</ref>\n\n===1950s===\nThe \"Blues\" continued to perform nationwide until the start of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, when (due to a shortage of pilots, and no planes were available) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty.

Later that year, they embarked on a European tour to a dozen sites, including the [[Paris Air Show]], where they were the only team to receive a standing ovation.\n\nThe ''Blues'' toured Europe again in 1967 touring six sites. In 1968 the C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft was replaced with a [[Lockheed C-121 Constellation|Lockheed VC-121J Constellation]]. The ''Blues'' transitioned to the two-seat [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4J Phantom II]] in 1969, nearly always keeping the back seat empty for flight demonstrations. The ''Phantom'' was the only plane to be flown by both the \"Blues\" and the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]]. That year they also upgraded to the [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed C-121 Super Constellation]] for logistics.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Golden Crown and Blue Angles.jpg|thumb|Members from the Imperial Iranian Air Force [[Golden Crown]] and the Blue Angels during the joint airshow; [[Kushke Nosrat Airbase]], 1973]]\n\nThe ''Blues'' received their first U.S. Marine Corps [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed KC-130F Hercules]] in 1970. An all-Marine crew manned it. That year, they went on their first South American tour. In 1971, the team conducted its first Far East Tour, performing at a dozen locations in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1972, the Blue Angels were awarded the Navy's [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for the two-year period from 1 March 1970 \u2013 31 December 1971.

The [[New Revised Standard Version]] prefers this latter translation,<ref name = \"MSM\" /> and both the King James Version and the [[Revised Version]] give it as an alternative in the margins. Hoskyns argues that it is to be preferred as the fundamental meaning and he drew attention to phrases such as \"birth of the Spirit ({{bibleref2|Jn|1:5|KJV|v.5}})\", \"birth from God (cf. {{bibleref2|Jn|1:12-13|KJV}}; {{bibleref2|1Jn|2:29|KJV}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Jn|3:9|KJV}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Jn|4:7|KJV}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Jn|5:18|KJV}})\" but maintains that this necessarily carries with it an emphasis upon the newness of the life as given by God himself.<ref>Hoskyns, Sir Edwyn C. and Davy, F.N.(ed), ''The Fourth Gospel'', Faber & Faber 2nd ed. 1947, pp. 211,212</ref>\n\nThe final use of the phrase occurs in the [[First Epistle of Peter]], rendered in the King James Version as:\n{{Quote|Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently: / Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.{{Bibleref2c|1Peter|1:22-23|KJV|1 Peter 1:22-23}}}}\n\nHere, the Greek word translated as \"born again\" is {{lang|el|\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9}} ({{transl|el|''anagegenn\u0113m\u00e9noi''}}).<ref name = \"SJF\">Fisichella, SJ., ''Taking Away the Veil: To See Beyond the Curtain of Illusion'', iUniverse, 2003, pp. 55-56.</ref>\n\n===Interpretations===\nThe traditional Jewish understanding of the promise of salvation is interpreted as being rooted in \"the seed of Abraham\"; that is, physical lineage from Abraham. Jesus explained to Nicodemus that this doctrine was in error\u2014that every person must have two births\u2014natural birth of the physical body and another of the water and the spirit.<ref>Emmons, Samuel B. ''A Bible Dictionary.'' BiblioLife, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-554-89108-8}}.</ref> This discourse with Nicodemus established the Christian belief that all human beings\u2014whether Jew or Gentile\u2014must be \"born again\" of the spiritual seed of Christ. The [[Apostle Peter]] further reinforced this understanding in {{Bibleref2|1Peter|1:23|KJV|1 Peter 1:23}}.<ref name=\"SJF\" /> The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that \"[a] controversy existed in the primitive church over the interpretation of the expression ''the [[seed of Abraham]]''. It is [the Apostle Paul's] teaching in one instance that all who are Christ's by faith are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to promise. He is concerned, however, with the fact that the promise is not being fulfilled to the seed of Abraham (referring to the Jews).\"<ref>Driscoll, James F. \"Divine Promise (in Scripture).\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 November 2009.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12453a.htm]</ref>\n\n[[Charles Hodge]] writes that \"The subjective change wrought in the soul by the grace of God, is variously designated in Scripture\" with terms such as ''new birth'', ''resurrection'', ''new life'', ''new creation'', ''renewing of the mind'', ''dying to sin and living to righteousness'', and ''translation from darkness to light''.<ref name=Hodge1>Hodge, Charles. \"Regeneration.\" ''Systematic Theology-Volume III.'' Web: http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology3.iii.i.i.html</ref>\n\nJesus used the \"birth\" analogy in tracing spiritual newness of life to a divine beginning. Contemporary Christian theologians have provided explanations for \"born from above\" being a more accurate translation of the original Greek word transliterated ''an\u014dthen.''<ref>[http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/anothen.html ''The New Testament Greek Lexicon.''] 30 July 2009.</ref> [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] cites two reasons why the newer translation is significant:\n# The emphasis \"from ''above''\" (implying \"from ''Heaven''\") calls attention to the source of the \"newness of life\". Stagg writes that the word \"again\" does not include the ''source'' of the new kind of beginning;\n# More than personal improvement is needed. \"a new destiny requires a new origin, and the new origin must be from God.\"<ref>Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}</ref>\n\nAn early example of the term in its more modern use appears in the sermons of [[John Wesley]]. In the sermon entitled ''A New Birth'' he writes, \"none can be holy unless he be born again\", and \"except he be born again, none can be happy even in this world. For ... a man should not be happy who is not holy.\" Also, \"I say, [a man] may be born again and so become an heir of salvation.\" Wesley also states infants who are baptized are born again, but for adults it is different:\n{{quote|our church supposes, that all who are baptized in their infancy, are at the same time born again. ... But ... it is sure all of riper years, who are baptized, are not at the same time born again.<ref>Wesley, J., ''The works of  the Reverend John Wesley'', Methodist Episcopal Church, 1831, pp. 405\u2013406.</ref>}}\n\nThe quotation from the Gospel of John has raised some questions about the meaning and authenticity of the phrase \"born again\". In the chapter, [[Nicodemus]] is puzzled and asks Jesus what he means by saying that \"Ye must be born again\". He questions: \"How can a man re-enter his mother's womb?\" Scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] says that this confusion is because in Greek (the language of the gospel) the word ''again'' is ambiguous. It might mean ''again'' or ''a second time'' or ''from above'', which would explain Nicodemus' confusion. However, the Jews at Jesus' time were actually speaking Aramaic, in which there would not have been a double meaning.

'Would you say you have been 'born again' or have had a 'born-again' experience?\" The Handbook says that \"Evangelical, black, and Latino Protestants tend to respond similarly, with about two-thirds of each group answering in the affirmative.

Moody]]. Individuals were encouraged to change their lives and 'come to Jesus'. Even with these early revivalists, the use of the term \"born again\" to describe this experience of conversion was still not widespread.\n\nHistorically, the classic text from [[John 3]] was consistently interpreted by the early church fathers as a reference to baptism.<ref>Joel C. Elworthy, Ed. ''Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament IVa'', ''John 1-10'', (Downers Grove: Intervarsity Press,2007), p. 109-110</ref> Modern Catholic interpreters have noted that the phrase 'born from above' or 'born again' (John 3:3) is clarified as 'being born of water and Spirit' (John 3:5).\n\nCatholic commentator John F. McHugh notes, \"Rebirth, and the commencement of this new life, are said to come about \u1f10\u03be \u1f55\u03b4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, of water and spirit. This phrase (without the article), refers to a rebirth which the early Church regarded as taking place through baptism (1 Pet 1.3, 23; Tit 3.5).\"<ref>John F. McHugh, ''John 1-4, The International Critical Commentary'', (New York: T&T Clark,2009), p. 227</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' notes that the essential elements of Christian initiation are: \"proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic communion\" (CCC 1229). Baptism gives the person the grace of forgiveness for all prior sins; it makes the newly baptized person a new creature and an adopted son of God (2 Corinthians 5:17; 2 Peter 1:4); it incorporates them into the Body of Christ (Ephesians 4:25) and creates a sacramental bond of unity leaving an indelible mark on our souls (CCC 1262-1274). \"Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation. Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated\" (CCC 1272). The Holy Spirit is involved with each aspect of the movement of grace. \"The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion. ... Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high\" (CCC 1989).\n\nThe Catholic Church also teaches that under special circumstances the need for water baptism can be superseded by the Holy Spirit in a 'baptism of desire', such as when [[catechumen]]s die or are martyred prior to receiving baptism (CCC 1260).\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]] wrote about \"the problem of children baptized in infancy [who] come for catechesis in the parish without receiving any other initiation into the faith and still without any explicit personal attachment to Jesus Christ\" (''Catechesi Tradendae'' 19).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_16101979_catechesi-tradendae.html|title=Catechesi Tradendae (October 16, 1979) - John Paul II|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> He noted that \"being a Christian means saying 'yes' to Jesus Christ, but let us remember that this 'yes' has two levels: It consists of surrendering to the word of God and relying on it, but it also means, at a later stage, endeavoring to know better&mdash;and better the profound meaning of this word\" (CT 20).\n\nThe modern expression being \"born again\" is really about the concept of \"conversion\".\n\t\nThe National Directory of Catechesis (published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB) defines conversion as, \"the acceptance of a personal relationship with Christ, a sincere adherence to him, and a willingness to conform one's life to his.\"<ref name=\"Catholic Bishops 2005 p. 48\">''United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory of Catechesis'' (2005) p. 48</ref> To put it more simply \"Conversion to Christ involves making a genuine commitment to him and a personal decision to follow him as his disciple.\"<ref name=\"Catholic Bishops 2005 p. 48\"/>\n \t\nEchoing the writings of Pope John Paul II, the ''National Directory of Catechesis'' describes a new intervention required by our modern world called the \"New Evangelization\".

It is commonly called the \"Bone\" (from \"B-One\"). It is one of three [[strategic bomber]]s in the U.S. Air Force fleet {{as of|2018|lc=yes}}, the other two being the [[B-2 Spirit]] and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]].\n\nThe B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the [[B-58 Hustler]] with the range and payload of the B-52, and would ultimately replace both bombers. After a long series of studies, [[Rockwell International]] (now part of [[Boeing]]) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A. This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high cost of the aircraft, the introduction of the [[AGM-86 ALCM|AGM-86]] [[cruise missile]] that flew the same basic profile, and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1. This led to the program being canceled in 1977, after the B-1A prototypes had been built.\n\nThe program was restarted in 1981, largely as an interim measure until the stealth bomber entered service. This led to a redesign as the B-1B, which had lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25, but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign, and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load. The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) as a nuclear bomber in 1986. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered.\n\nIn the early 1990s, following the [[Gulf War]] and concurrent with the disestablishment of SAC and its reassignment to the newly formed [[Air Combat Command]], the B-1B was converted to conventional bombing use. It first served in combat during [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|Operation Desert Fox]] in 1998 and again during the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO action in Kosovo]] the following year. The B-1B has supported U.S. and [[NATO]] military forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].  The Air Force had 66 B-1Bs in service as of September 2012.  The B-1B is expected to continue to serve into the 2030s, with the [[Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider]] to begin replacing the B-1B after 2025. The B-1s currently in inventory will be retired by 2036.<ref>[http://www.airforcemag.com/Features/Pages/2018/February%202018/USAF-to-Retire-B-1-B-2-in-Early-2030s-as-B-21-Comes-On-Line.aspx USAF to Retire B-1, B-2 in Early 2030s as B-21 Comes On-Line].

This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances through the use of [[terrain mask#Terrain masking|terrain masking]]; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys, the line-of-sight from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar (and human observers) incapable of seeing it.<ref name=Spick_1986_p6-8/> Additionally, radars of the era were subject to \"[[clutter (radar)|clutter]]\" from stray returns from the ground and other objects, which meant a minimum angle existed above the horizon where they could detect a target. Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from the radar sites. This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low-flying aircraft.<ref name=Spick_1986_p6-8>{{harvnb|Spick|1986|pp=6\u20138.}}</ref><ref name=\"Schwartz p.119\"/> The same effects also meant that low-flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher-flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against the clutter from ground reflections (lack of [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability).\n\nThe switch from high-altitude to low-altitude flight profiles severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned to provide the desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher [[aerodynamic drag]] at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range.<ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21/> The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President [[John F. Kennedy]],<ref name=\"Schwartz p.118\">{{harvnb|Schwartz|1998|p=118.}}</ref><ref>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950002358_1995102358.pdf \"NASA-CR-115702, B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report, Vol. I, p.

The B-52's huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times, and the large airframe allowed the addition of improved [[radar jamming and deception]] suites to deal with radars.<ref>{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=279\u2013280.}}</ref> During the [[Vietnam War]], the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head, and the \"big belly\" modifications increased the B-52's total bomb load to {{convert|60000|lb|kg}},<ref>{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=256.}}</ref> turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.119\"/> The much smaller bomb bay of the B-70 would have made it much less useful in this role.\n\n===Design studies and delays===\nAlthough effective, the B-52 was not ideal for the low-level role. This led to a number of aircraft designs known as [[penetrator (aircraft)|penetrators]], which were tuned specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions.<ref>Gunston 1978, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well, notably the [[BAC TSR-2]], and later, [[Panavia Tornado]] and [[Sukhoi Su-24]]. A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed.\n\nThe first post-B-70 strategic penetrator study was known as the Subsonic Low-Altitude Bomber (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that looked more like an airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, [[T-tail]], and large [[turbofan|high-bypass engines]].<ref>Taylor, Gordon.

The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the [[nuclear triad]] concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe [[counterforce]] option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman III]], had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets.

After the nose gear failed to deploy, the crew attempted to lower the nose gear via the alternate emergency gear-extension method.  After several hours of attempting different means to lower the nose gear, the decision was made to perform a nose-gear-up landing on [[Rogers Dry Lake]] at Edwards. The lower portion of the forward bulkhead used to mount the radar antenna was the only part of the aircraft to suffer damage, and after repairs, the jet was returned to Dyess in January 1990 by the same crew which performed the emergency landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.targetlock.org.uk/b-1/service-part1.html|title=Target Lock: B-1B : Squadron Service 1985 to 1992|work=targetlock.org.uk|accessdate=1 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172809/http://www.targetlock.org.uk/b-1/service-part1.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* In October 1990, while flying a training route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the [[384th Bomb Wing]], 28th Bomb Squadron, [[McConnell AFB]], experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine was shut down and its [[fire extinguisher]] was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft.<ref name=Jenkins_p114/>\n* In December 1990, B-1B (s/n 83-0071) from the 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, experienced a jolt that caused the #3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating. This event, coupled with the October 1990 engine incident, led to a 50+ day grounding of the B-1Bs not on [[Second strike#Implementation|nuclear alert]] status. The problem was eventually traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, and all B-1Bs were equipped with modified engines.<ref name=Jenkins_p114/>\n* In June 1994, B-1B (s/n 84-0057) from the [[7th Bomb Wing]], [[9th Bomb Squadron]], made an emergency diversion to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]], Germany due to a wing sweep malfunction.  The crew made a high-speed landing at Rhein-Main and stopped {{cvt|100|ft}} short of the end of the runway.  Afterwards the overheated brakes led to a fire in the right main landing gear, but it was quickly extinguished.<ref>Dorr, Robert F.

The investigation into the incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32&nbsp;million.<ref>Stemple, Master Sgt. John.

A resulting fire was quickly extinguished and the crew escaped through the top hatch with only a minor back injury to the co-pilot. The air force investigation concluded that the crew \"forgot to lower the [[landing gear]]\" based on the following reasons: 1) co-pilot task oversaturation, 2) co-pilot's wanting to complete a long mission, 3) neither pilot completed the landing checklist, 4) co-pilot's belief that the pilot had lowered the landing gear when he had not, 5) pilot had turned over control to the co-pilot on the final approach and the pilot had reported to base that the landing gear was down when it was not \u2013 indicator lights showing the landing gear was still up were working and apparently ignored. As a result, the B-1B impacted and slid on the runway, which caused approximately $8 million of damage to the aircraft and runway.<ref>[http://www.acc.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/5725/Article/202974/report-pilot-error-caused-b-1b-crash.aspx \"Report: pilot error caused B-1B crash.\"] ''Air Combat Command Public Affairs'', USAF, 18 September 2006.

of Common Prayer''''' ('''''BCP''''') is the short title of a number of related [[prayer book]]s used in the [[Anglican Communion]], as well as by other [[Christianity|Christian]] churches historically related to Anglicanism. The original book, published in 1549 in the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], was a product of the [[English Reformation]] following the break with [[Catholic Church|Rome]]. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English. It contained [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], the [[Litany]], and [[Holy Communion]] and also the occasional services in full: the orders for [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Marriage]], \"[[Anointing of the Sick|prayers to be said with the sick]]\", and a [[funeral]] service. It also set out in full the \"[[propers]]\" (that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or, at times, daily throughout the Church's Year): the [[introit]]s, [[collect]]s, and [[epistle]] and [[gospel]] readings for the Sunday service of Holy Communion. [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the [[Psalms]]; and [[canticles]], mostly biblical, that were provided to be said or sung between the readings.<ref> {{harv|Careless|2003| p=26}}</ref>\n\nThe 1549 book was soon succeeded by a more reformed revision in 1552 under the same editorial hand, that of [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. It was used only for a few months, as after Edward VI's death in 1553, his half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] restored Roman Catholic worship. Mary died in 1558 and, in 1559, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] reintroduced the 1552 book with modifications to make it acceptable to more traditionally minded worshippers.\n\nIn 1604, [[James I of England|James I]] ordered some further changes, the most significant being the addition to the Catechism of a section on the Sacraments. Following the tumultuous events surrounding the [[English Civil War]], when the Book was again abolished, another modest revision was published in 1662 {{harv|Church of England|1662}}. That edition remains the official prayer book of the [[Church of England]], although through the later twentieth century alternative forms which were technically supplements largely displaced the ''Book of Common Prayer'' for the main Sunday worship of most English [[Parish (Church of England)|parish]] churches.\n\nA ''Book of Common Prayer'' with local variations is used in churches around, or deriving from, the [[Anglican Communion]] in over 50 different countries and in over 150 different languages.<ref>{{harv|Careless|2003| p=23}}</ref> In some parts of the world, the 1662 Book remains technically authoritative but other books or patterns have replaced it in regular  worship.\n\nTraditional English [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Presbyterian]] prayer books have borrowed from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the English language. Like the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] and the works of [[Shakespeare]], many words and phrases from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' have entered common parlance.\n\n==Full name==\n\nThe full name of the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'' is ''The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the use of the Church of England, Together with the Psalter or Psalms of David, pointed as they are to be Sung or said in churches: And the Form and Manner of Making, ordaining, and Consecrating of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the use of the Church of England, Together with the Psalter or Psalms of David, pointed as they are to be Sung or said in churches: And the Form and Manner of Making, ordaining, and Consecrating of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons|url=https://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/4409457|website=brbl-dl.library.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University [[Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library]]|accessdate=11 December 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe forms of parish worship in the late medieval church in England, which followed the Latin [[Roman Rite]], varied according to local practice. By far the most common form, or \"use\", found in Southern England was that of [[Use of Sarum|Sarum]] (Salisbury). There was no single book; the services that would be provided by the ''Book of Common Prayer'' were to be found in the [[Missal]] (the Eucharist), the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]] (daily offices), Manual (the occasional services of Baptism, Marriage, Burial etc.), and [[Pontifical]] (services appropriate to a [[bishop]]\u2014Confirmation, Ordination) {{harv|Harrison|Sansom|1982|p=29}}. The chant ([[plainsong]], [[plainchant]]) for worship was contained in the [[Roman Gradual]] for the Mass and in the [[Antiphoner]] for the offices. The ''Book of Common Prayer'' has never contained prescribed music or chant; however, [[John Merbecke]] produced his ''Booke of Common Praier noted'' in 1550 which set what would have been the proper of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Creed, etc.) in the new BCP to simple plainchant inspired by Sarum Use. The work of producing a liturgy in the English language books was largely done by [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], starting cautiously in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and then more radically under his son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. In his early days Cranmer was somewhat conservative: an admirer, if a critical one, of [[John Fisher]]. It may have been his visit to Germany in 1532 (where he secretly married) which began the change in his outlook. Then in 1538, as Henry began diplomatic negotiations with Lutheran princes, Cranmer came face to face with a Lutheran embassy {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=215}}. The [[Exhortation and Litany (1544)|Exhortation and Litany]], the earliest English-language service of the Church of England, was the first overt manifestation of his changing views. It was no mere translation from the Latin: its [[Protestant]] character is made clear by the drastic reduction of the place of saints, compressing what had been the major part into three petitions {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=31}}. Published in 1544, it borrowed greatly from [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Litany]] and [[Myles Coverdale]]'s [[New Testament]] and was the only service that might be considered to be \"[[Protestant]]\" to be finished within the lifetime of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].\n\n===Prayer Books of Edward VI===\n\n====1549====\n[[File:Book of common prayer 1549.jpg|thumb|250px|Cranmer's 1549 ''Book of Common Prayer'']]\nIt was only on Henry's death in 1547 and the accession of Edward VI that revision could proceed faster. [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] finished his work on an English [[Eucharist|Communion]] rite in 1548, obeying an order of [[Convocation]] of the previous year that communion was to be given to the people as both bread and wine. The ordinary Roman Rite of the Mass had made no provision for any congregation present to receive communion in both species.  So, Cranmer composed in English an additional rite of congregational preparation and communion (based on the form of the Sarum rite for Communion of the Sick), to be undertaken immediately following the communion, in both kinds, of the priest. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFurther developed, and fully translated into English, this Communion service 'commonly called the Mass' was included, one year later, in 1549, in a full prayer book, set out with daily offices, readings for Sundays and Holy Days, the Communion Service, Public [[Baptism]], of [[Confirmation]], of [[Matrimony]], The Visitation of the Sick, At a Burial and the Ordinal (added in 1550) {{harv|Gibson|1910}}. The Preface to this edition, which contained Cranmer's explanation as to why a new prayer book was necessary, began: \"There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted.\" Although the work is commonly attributed to Cranmer, its detailed origins are obscure {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=45}} {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=414}}. A group of bishops and divines met first at Chertsey and then at Windsor in 1548, drawn from both conservatives and reformers, agreed only \"the service of the church ought to be in the mother tongue\" {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=47}}. Cranmer collected the material from many sources; even the opening of Preface (above) was borrowed {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=225}}. He borrowed much from German sources, particularly from work commissioned by [[Hermann of Wied|Hermann von Wied]], Archbishop of Cologne; and also from [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]] (to whom he was related by marriage) {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=414}}. The Church Order of Brandenberg and Nuremberg was partly the work of the latter. Many phrases are characteristic of the German reformer [[Martin Bucer]], or of the Italian [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr]], (who was staying with Cranmer at the time of the finalising of drafts), or of his chaplain, [[Thomas Becon]]. However, to Cranmer is \"credited the overall job of editorship and the overarching structure of the book\" including the systematic amendment of his materials to remove any idea that human merit contributed to their salvation {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=417}}.\n\nThe Communion service of 1549 maintained the format of distinct rites of [[consecration]] and [[Communion rite|communion]], that had been introduced the previous year; but with the Latin rite of the Mass (chiefly following the familiar structure in the [[Use of Sarum]]), translated into English. By outwardly maintaining familiar forms, Cranmer hoped to establish the practice of weekly congregational communion, and included exhortations to encourage this; and instructions that communion should never be received by the priest alone. This represented a radical change from late medieval practice\u2014whereby the primary focus of congregational worship was taken to be attendance at the consecration, and adoration of the elevated consecrated host. In late medieval England, congregations regularly received communion only at [[Easter]]; and otherwise individual lay people might expect to receive communion only when gravely ill, or in the form of a [[Nuptial Mass]] on being married. Doctrinally and most importantly Cranmer deleted any reference that the Eucharist is the Church's offering and an objective and material sacrifice by the Church to God in union with Christ was omitted from the Prayer of Consecration as had been the belief since the mid-second century as stated in the Consecration Prayers. Although fully aware of this Cranmer demonstrated his opposition to ancient practice (The Study of Liturgy, Editors, Jones, Wainwright, Yarnold SJ and Bradshaw, Revised Edition 1992, p. 101-105) by omitting oblationary language in the prayer as it continued immediately after the Words of the Institution, \"wherefore O Lord and Heavenly Father, according to the institution of thy dearly beloved Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make here  thy Divine Majesty, with these they holy gifts, the memorial thy Son has willeth to make.\" Absent is an oblation of the gifts signified by language such as \"which we present unto thee,\" or \"bring before thee\" or \"offer unto thee.\"  He made sure in the Second Prayer Book Rite that no possible association could be made: the Prayer of Consecration ended with the Words of Institution. He also omitted the Epiclesis from the Second Book. The recovery of oblation and the epiclesis would have to wait until the Scottish Non-Jurors in the 18th century did so, \"which we now offer unto thee,\" placed after \"holy gifts.\" The Episcopal Church USA adopted the formula in 1789: six words added to a modified version of the 1549 Prayer in effect repudiated Cranmer's theology of sacrifice which restricted to the communicants' offering themselves in an optional thanksgiving prayer. As for his theology of Christ's Presence it was Calvinistic Virtualism: Christ is present by the power of the Holy Spirit. However the 1549 Rite is ambiguous about this referring to the Eucharist as spiritual food but in to the Real Presence in the Words of Administration, \"The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ,\" \"The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" The Non-Juror Rite asserted a kind of Virtualism while making the Eucharist a proper sacrifice, op. cit. p. 108{{cn|date=September 2017}}, while the Elizabethan Settlement in one of the first moves to undo Cranmer left open the question of the Real Presence because the Queen insisted that the Words of Administration be from the 1549 Book where the doctrine was implicit and include also the words from the 1552 Book which are Receptionism. The 1559 Book retained the truncated Prayer of Consecration which omitted any notion of objective sacrifice. It would be a long road back for the Church of England with no clear indication that it would retreat from the 1559 Settlement except for minor official changes. However, from the 17th century some prominent Anglican theologians tried  to cast a more traditional interpretation onto it though the words of the rite might not carry. It not be until the Oxford Movement of the 19th century and 20th century revisions that the Church of England would attempt to deal with the Eucharisitic doctrines of Cranmer - focused on Receiving Christ, Virtiual Presence, Receptionism, and the eucharistic sacrifice confined to an optional Thanksgiving Prayer said by the communicants empowered to do so by having received - by bringing the Church back to \"pre-Reformation doctrine,\" ibid. p. 108, which among other matters sees the congregation first offering itself through the Consecrated Elements, the Gifts of God, before receiving the same.                \n\nCranmer's work of simplification and revision was also applied to the Daily Offices, which were to become [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]], and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]]; and which he hoped would also serve as a daily form of prayer to be used by the Laity, thus replacing both the late medieval lay observation of the Latin [[Book of Hours|Hours of the Virgin]], and its English equivalent, the ''Primer''. This simplification was anticipated by the work of Cardinal [[Francis Qui\u00f1ones]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]], in his abortive revision of the Roman Breviary published in 1537 {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=27}}. Cranmer took up Qui\u00f1ones's principle that everything should be sacrificed to secure continuity in singing the Psalter and reading the Bible. His first draft, produced during Henry's reign, retained the traditional seven distinct [[Canonical hours]] of Office prayer; but in his second draft, while he retained the Latin, he consolidated these into two {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=34}}. The 1549 book then dispensed with the Latin, and with all non-biblical readings; and established a rigorously biblical cycle of readings for Morning and Evening Prayer (set according to the calendar year, rather than the ecclesiastical year) and a Psalter to be read consecutively throughout each month. The readings provided that the New Testament (other than the [[Book of Revelation]]) be read through three times in a year, while the [[Old Testament]], including the [[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocrypha]] would be read through once. Of the set canticles, only the [[Te Deum]] was retained of the non-biblical material.\n\nIntroduced on Whitsunday 1549, after considerable debate and revision in Parliament\u2014but there is no evidence that it was ever submitted to either Convocation\u2014it was said to have pleased neither reformers nor their opponents, indeed the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]] could say of it was that it \"was patient of a catholic interpretation\". It was clearly unpopular in the parishes of Devon and Cornwall where, along with severe social problems, its introduction was one of the causes of the \"commotions\", or rebellions in the summer of that year, partly because many Cornish people lacked sufficient English to understand it {{harv|Duffy (b)|2003| pp=131ff}},{{harv|Caraman|1994}}. [It appears that it was far less significant in the other \"commotions\" in the Home Counties and the \"Eastern Rebellion\".]{{harv|MacCulloch|1996|pp=431ff}} Particularly unpopular was the banning of processions and the sending out of commissioners to enforce the new requirements. There was widespread opposition to the introduction of regular congregational Communion, partly because the extra costs of bread and wine that would fall on the parish;{{dubious|reason=later speculation rather than hard evidence?|date=November 2011}} but mainly out of an intense resistance to undertaking in regular worship, a religious practice previously associated with marriage or illness.\n\n====1552====\n[[File:Book of common prayer 1552.jpg|thumb|left|Cranmer's Prayer book of 1552]]\nThe 1549 book was, from the outset, intended only as a temporary expedient, as Bucer was assured having met Cranmer for the first time in April 1549: 'concessions...made both as a respect for antiquity and to the infirmity of the present age' as he wrote {{harv|MacCulloch |1996| p=411}}. Both Bucer and Peter Martyr wrote detailed proposals for modification; Bucer's ''Censura'' ran to 28 chapters which influenced Cranmer significantly though he did not follow them slavishly and the new book was duly produced in 1552, making \"fully perfect\" what was already implicit {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=71}} {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=505}}. The policy of incremental reform was now unveiled: more Roman Catholic practices were now excised, as doctrines had in 1549 been subtly changed. Thus, in the [[Eucharist]], gone were the words [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[altar]]; the '[[Kyrie|Lord have mercy]]' was interleaved into a recitation of the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] was removed to the end of the service. The Eucharistic prayer was split in two so that Eucharistic bread and wine were shared immediately after the words of institution (This is my Body..This is my blood...in remembrance of me.); while its final element, the Prayer of Oblation, (with its reference to an offering of a 'Sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving'), was transferred, much changed, to a position after the priest and congregation had received Communion, and was made optional to an alternative prayer of thanksgiving. The Elevation of the Host had been forbidden in 1549; all manual acts were now omitted. The words at the administration of Communion which, in the prayer book of 1549 described the Eucharistic species as 'The body of our Lorde Jesus Christe...', 'The blood of our Lorde Jesus Christe...' were replaced with the words 'Take, eat, in remembrance that Christ died for thee..' etc. The Peace, at which in the early Church the congregation had exchanged a greeting, was removed altogether. Vestments such as the [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[chasuble]] and [[cope]] were no longer to be worn, but only a [[surplice]],  removing all elements of sacrificial offering from the Latin Mass; so that it should cease to be seen as a ritual at which the priest, on behalf of the flock gave Christ to God; and might rather be seen as a ritual whereby Christ shared his body and blood, according to a different sacramental theology, with the faithful.\n\nCranmer recognized that the 1549 rite of Communion was capable of conservative misinterpretation and misuse in that the consecration rite might still be undertaken even when no congregational Communion followed. Consequently, in 1552 he thoroughly integrated Consecration and Communion into a single rite, with congregational preparation preceding the words of institution\u2014such that it would not be possible to mimic the Mass with the priest communicating alone. He appears nevertheless, to have been resigned to being unable for the present to establish in parishes the weekly practice of receiving Communion; so he restructured the service so as to allow ante-Communion as a distinct rite of worship\u2014following the Communion rite through the readings and offertory, as far as the intercessory \"Prayer for the Church Militant\".\n\nDiarmaid MacCulloch suggests that Cranmer's own Eucharistic theology in these years approximated most closely to that of [[Heinrich Bullinger]]; but that he intended the Prayer Book to be acceptable to the widest range of Reformed Eucharistic belief, including the high sacramental theology of [[Bucer]] and [[John Calvin]] {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=615}}. At the same time, however, Cranmer intended that constituent parts of the rites gathered into the Prayer Book should still, so far as possible, be recognizably derived from traditional forms and elements.\n\nIn the baptism service, the signing with the cross was moved until after the baptism and the exorcism, the anointing, the putting-on of the chrysom robe and the triple immersion were omitted. Most drastic of all was the removal of the Burial service from church: it was to take place at the graveside {{harv|Spinks|1999|p=187}}. In 1549, there had been provision for a Requiem (not so called) and prayers of commendation and committal, the first addressed to the deceased. All that remained was a single reference to the deceased, giving thanks for their delivery from 'the myseryes of this sinneful world'. This new Order for the Burial of the Dead was a drastically stripped-down memorial service designed to undermine definitively the whole complex of traditional beliefs about Purgatory and intercessory prayer {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=81}} {{harv|Duffy (a)|1992| pp=472\u20135}}.\n\nIn other respects, however, both the Baptism and Burial services imply a theology of salvation that accords notably less with [[Reformed]] teachings than do the counterpart passages in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]]. In the Burial service, the possibility that a deceased person who has died in the faith may nevertheless not be counted amongst God's [[predestination|elect]], is not entertained. In the Baptism service the priest explicitly pronounces the baptised infant as being now ''[[baptismal regeneration|regenerate]]''. In both cases, conformity with strict Reformed Protestant principles would have resulted in a conditional formulation. The continued inconsistency between the Articles of Religion and the Prayer Book remained a point of contention for Puritans; and would in the 19th century come close to tearing the Church of England apart, through the course of the [[Gorham judgement]].\n\nThe Orders of Morning and Evening Prayer were extended by the inclusion of a penitential section at the beginning including a corporate confession of sin and a general absolution, although the text was printed only in Morning Prayer with rubrical directions to use it in the evening as well. The general pattern of Bible reading in 1549 was retained (as it was in 1559) except that distinct Old and New Testament readings were now specified for Morning and Evening Prayer on certain feast days. Following the publication of the 1552 Prayer Book, a revised English Primer was published in 1553; adapting the Offices and Morning and Evening Prayer, and other prayers, for lay domestic piety {{harv|MacCulloch|1996| p=510}}.\n\n===English Prayer Book during the reign of Mary I===\nThe 1552 book, however, was used only for a short period, as Edward VI had died in the summer of 1553 and, as soon as she could do so, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], restored union with Rome. The Latin Mass was re-established, altars, roods and statues were reinstated; an attempt was made to restore the English Church to its Roman affiliation. Cranmer was punished for his work in the [[English Reformation]] by being burned at the stake on 21 March 1556. Nevertheless, the 1552 book was to survive. After Mary's death in 1558, it became the primary source for the Elizabethan Book of Common Prayer, with subtle if significant changes only.\n\nHundreds of Protestants fled into exile\u2014establishing an English church in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. A bitter and very public dispute ensued between those, such as [[Edmund Grindal]] and [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]], who wished to preserve in exile the exact form of worship of the 1552 Prayer Book; and those, such as [[John Knox]] the minister of the congregation, who regarded that book as still partially tainted with compromise. Eventually, in 1555, the civil authorities expelled Knox and his supporters to [[Geneva]], where they adopted a new prayer book, ''The Form of Prayers'', which derived principally from Calvin's French ''La Forme des Pri\u00e8res'' {{harv|Maxwell|1965| p=5}}. Consequently, when the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] re-asserted the dominance of the reformed Church of England, there remained a significant body of more Protestant believers who were nevertheless hostile to the ''Book of Common Prayer''. John Knox took ''The Form of Prayers'' with him to Scotland, where it formed the basis of the Scottish ''[[Book of Common Order]]''.\n\n===1559 Prayer Book===\n[[File:Book of common prayer 1559.jpg|thumb|250px|Prayer book of 1559.]]\n<!--Thus, u-->Under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], a more permanent enforcement of the reformed Church of England was undertaken and the 1552 book was republished, scarcely altered, in 1559 {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=94}}.\n\nThe alterations, though minor, were however to cast a long shadow in the development of the Church of England. One, the \"[[Ornaments Rubric]]\", related to what clergy were to wear while conducting services. Instead of the banning of all vestments except the rochet for bishops and the [[surplice]] for parish clergy, it permitted \"such ornaments...as were in use...in the second year of K. Edward VI\". This allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain some of the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration (at least until the Queen gave further instructions under the [[Act of Uniformity]] of 1559). It was to be the basis of claims in the 19th century that vestments such as chasubles, albs and stoles were legal. At Holy Communion, the words from the 1549 book, \"the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ\" etc. were  combined with the words of Edward's second book, \"Take eat in remembrance\" \"suggesting on the one hand a real presence to those who wished to find it and on the other, the communion as memorial only\",{{harv|MacCulloch|1990| p=27}} i.e. an objective presence and subjective reception. The instruction to the congregation to kneel when receiving communion was retained; but the [[Black Rubric]] (#29 in the Forty-Two Articles of Faith which were reduced to 39) which denied any \"real and essential presence\" of Christ's flesh and blood, was removed  to \"conciliate traditionalists\" and aligned with Queen's sensibilities, {{harv|MacCulloch|1996|p=528}}. The removal of the Black Rubric complements the dual words of administration of communion and permits an action, kneeling to receive, which people were used to doing. The Prayer Book \"...was a masterpiece of theological engineering,\" (arv.{{harv|MacCulloch|1990| p=27}}. The doctrines in the Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion would set the tone of Anglicanism which would prefer to steer a Middle Way between Roman Catholicism and radical forms of Protestantism, and avoid being identified as a Confessional Church like Calvinists and Lutherans. The conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that reformed principles were by no means universally popular&nbsp;\u2013 a fact that the Queen recognised: her revived [[Act of Supremacy]], giving her the ambiguous title of [[Supreme Governor]], passed without difficulty but the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]], giving statutory force to the Prayer Book, passed through the House of Lords by only three votes.{{harv|Starkey|2001|p=284f}} It made constitutional history in being imposed by the laity alone, as all the bishops, except those imprisoned by the Queen and unable to attend, voted against it {{harv|Guy|1988| p=262}}. Convocation had made its position clear by affirming the traditional doctrine of the Eucharist, the authority of the Pope, and the reservation by divine law to clergy \"of handling and defining concerning the things belonging to faith, sacraments, and discipline ecclesiastical\" {{harv|Clarke|1954| p=182}}.\n\nAfter the several innovations and reversals, the new forms of worship took time to settle in. Among Cranmer's innovations, retained in the new book was the requirement of weekly Holy Communion services. In practice, as before the English Reformation, many received communion rarely, as little as once a year in some cases; [[George Herbert]] estimated it as no more than six times. {{harv|Marsh|1998| p=50}}. Practice, however, varied from place to place: very high attendance at festivals was the order of the day in many parishes and in some regular communion was very popular, in other places families stayed away or sent \"a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household.\" {{harv|Maltby|1998| p=123}} {{harv|Furlong|2000| p=43}}. Few parish clergy were initially licensed to preach by the bishops; in the absence of a licensed preacher, Sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the [[Book of Homilies|homilies]] written by Cranmer {{harv|Chapman|2006| p=29}}. George Herbert was, however, not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching, which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest {{harv|Maltby|1998| p=67}}. Music was much simplified and a radical distinction developed between, on the one hand, parish worship where only the [[metrical psalms]] of Sternhold and Hopkins might be sung and, on the other hand, worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations, where the music of [[John Marbeck]] and others was developed into a rich choral tradition {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=125}} {{harv|Marsh|1998| p=31}}. The whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours; and accordingly, churches were equipped with [[pew]]s in which households could sit together (whereas in the medieval church, men and women had worshipped separately). Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the new act of worship as, \"a morning marathon of prayer, scripture reading, and praise, consisting of mattins, litany, and ante-communion, preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week.\" {{harv|Furlong|2000| p=43}}.\n\nMany ordinary churchgoers\u2014that is those who could afford a copy as it was expensive\u2014would own a copy of the prayer book. Judith Maltby cites a story of parishioners at Flixton in Suffolk who brought their own prayer books to church in order to shame their vicar into conforming with it: they eventually ousted him {{harv|Maltby|1998| p=44}}. Between 1549 and 1642, roughly 290 editions of the prayer book were produced {{harv|Maltby|1998| p=24}}. Before the end of the [[English Civil War]] (1642-1651) and the introduction of the 1662 prayer book, something like a half a million prayer books are estimated to have been in circulation {{harv|Maltby|1998| p=24}}.\n\nA (re)translation into Latin of the 1559 Book of Common Prayer was made in the form of [[Walter Haddon]]'s ''Liber Precum Publicarum'' of 1560.  Its use was destined for the universities.\n\nThe Welsh edition of the Book of Common Prayer was published in 1567.  It was translated by [[William Salesbury]] assisted by [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]].<ref name=\"DictWelshBiog\" />\n\n===Changes in 1604===\nOn Elizabeth's death in 1603, the 1559 book, substantially that of 1552 which had been regarded as offensive by some, such as Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]], as being a break with the tradition of the Western Church, had come to be regarded in some quarters as unduly Catholic. On his accession and following the so-called \"[[Millenary Petition]]\", [[James I of England|James I]] called the [[Hampton Court Conference]] in 1604\u2014the same meeting of bishops and Puritan divines that initiated the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible. This was in effect a series of two conferences: (i) between James and the bishops; (ii) between James and the Puritans on the following day. The Puritans raised four areas of concern: purity of doctrine; the means of maintaining it; church government; and the ''Book of Common Prayer''. Here Confirmation, the cross in baptism, private baptism, the use of the surplice, kneeling for communion, reading the ''Apocrypha''; and subscription to the BCP and Articles were all touched on. On the third day, after James had received a report back from the bishops and made final modifications, he announced his decisions to the Puritans and bishops.{{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe business of making the changes was then entrusted to a small committee of bishops and the Privy Council and, apart from tidying up details, this committee introduced into Morning and Evening Prayer a prayer for the Royal Family; added several thanksgivings to the Occasional Prayers at the end of the Litany; altered the rubrics of Private Baptism limiting it to the minister of the parish, or some other lawful minister, but still allowing it in private houses (the Puritans had wanted it only in the church); and added to the Catechism the section on the sacraments. The changes were put into effect by means of an explanation issued by James in the exercise of his prerogative under the terms of the 1559 Act of Uniformity and Act of Supremacy. {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| pp=140\u2013143}}\n\nThe accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625\u20131649) brought about a complete change in the religious scene in that the new king used his supremacy over the established church \"to promote his own idiosyncratic style of sacramental Kingship\" which was \"a very weird aberration from the first hundred years of the early reformed Church of England\". He questioned \"the populist and parliamentary basis of the Reformation Church\" and unsettled to a great extent \"the consensual accommodation of Anglicanism\"{{harv| Davies|1992| p=2,3}} and this led to the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and republican [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].\n\nWith the defeat of Charles I (1625\u20131649) in the Civil War, the Puritan pressure, exercised through a much-changed Parliament, had increased. Puritan-inspired petitions for the removal of the prayer book and episcopacy \"[[Root and Branch|root and branch]]\" resulted in local disquiet in many places and, eventually, the production of locally organized counter petitions. The parliamentary government had its way but it became clear that the division was not between Catholics and Protestants, but between Puritans and those who valued the Elizabethan settlement. {{harv|Maltby|1998| p=24}}. The 1604 book was finally outlawed by Parliament in 1645 to be replaced by the [[Directory of Public Worship]], which was more a set of instructions than a prayer book. How widely the Directory was used is not certain; there is some evidence of its having been purchased, in churchwardens' accounts, but not widely. The Prayer Book certainly was used clandestinely in some places, not least because the Directory made no provision at all for burial services. Following the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Lord Protector [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], it would not be reinstated until shortly after the restoration of the monarchy to England.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] records, in ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]]'', receiving communion according to the 1604 Prayer Book rite:\n:''Christmas Day 1657. I went to London with my wife to celebrate Christmas Day... Sermon ended, as [the minister] was giving us the holy sacrament, the chapel was surrounded with soldiers, and all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away... These wretched miscreants held their muskets against us as we came up to receive the sacred elements, as if they would have shot us at the altar.''\n\n===Changes made in Scotland===\n[[File:Book of common prayer Scotland 1637.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Laud's abortive 1637 Prayer book.]]\nIn 1557, the Scots Protestant lords had adopted the English Prayer Book of 1552, for [[reformed worship]] in Scotland. However, when [[John Knox]] returned to Scotland in 1559, he continued to use the ''Form of Prayer'' he had created for the English exiles in [[Geneva]] and, in 1564, this supplanted the ''Book of Common Prayer'' under the title of the ''[[Book of Common Order]]''.\n\nFollowing the accession of King [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] to the throne of England his son, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with the assistance of Archbishop Laud, sought to impose the prayer book on Scotland {{harv|Perry|1922}}. The book concerned was not, however, the 1559 book but very much that of 1549, the first book of Edward VI. First used in 1637, it was never accepted, having been [[Jenny Geddes|violently rejected]] by the Scots. During one reading of the book at mass in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], the [[Walter Whitford| Bishop of Brechin]] was forced to protect himself while reading from the book by pointing loaded pistols at the congregation<ref>Durston 1998, p. 27.</ref>.  Following the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (including the [[English Civil War]]), the [[Church of Scotland]] was re-established on a [[presbyterianism|presbyterian]] basis but by the Act of Comprehension 1690, the rump of [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]] were allowed to hold onto their [[benefice]]s. For liturgy they looked to Laud's book and in 1724 the first of the \"wee bookies\" was published, containing, for the sake of economy, the central part of the Communion liturgy beginning with the offertory {{harv|Perry|1922|loc=Chapter 4}}.\n\nBetween then and 1764, when a more formal revised version was published, a number of things happened which were to separate the Scottish Episcopal liturgy more firmly from either the English books of 1549 or 1559. First, informal changes were made to the order of the various parts of the service and inserting words indicating a sacrificial intent to the Eucharist clearly evident in the words,\"we thy humble servants do celebrate and make before thy Divine Majesty with these thy holy gifts which we now OFFER unto thee, the memorial thy Son has commandeth us to make;\" secondly, as a result of Bishop Rattray's researches into the liturgies of St James and St Clement, published in 1744, the form of the invocation was changed. These changes were incorporated into the 1764 book which was to be the liturgy of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] (until 1911 when it was revised) but it was to influence the liturgy of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]]. A completely new revision was finished in 1929 and several alternative orders of the Communion service and other services have been prepared since then.\n\n===1662===\nThe 1662 Prayer Book was printed only two years after the restoration of the monarchy, following the [[Savoy Conference]] between representative [[Presbyterians]] and twelve bishops which was convened by Royal Warrant to \"advise upon and review the ''Book of Common Prayer''\" {{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=169,170}}. Attempts by the Presbyterians, led by [[Richard Baxter]], to gain approval for an alternative service book failed. Their major objections (exceptions) were: firstly, that it was improper for lay people to take any vocal part in prayer (as in the Litany or Lord's Prayer), other than to say \"amen\"; secondly, that no set prayer should exclude the option of an extempore alternative from the minister; thirdly, that the minister should have the option to omit part of the set liturgy at his discretion; fourthly, that short [[collect]]s should be replaced by longer prayers and exhortations; and fifthly, that all surviving \"Catholic\" ceremonial should be removed.{{harv|Harrison|Sansom|1982| p=53}}. The suggested changes intent was to achieve a greater correspondence between liturgy and Scripture. The bishops gave a frosty reply. They declared that liturgy could not be circumscribed by Scripture, but rightfully included those matter which were \"generally received in the Catholic church.\" They rejected extempore prayer as apt to be filled with \"idle, impertinent, ridiculous, sometimes seditious, impious and blasphemous expressions.\" The notion that the Prayer Book was defective because it dealt in generalizations brought the crisp response that such expressions were \"the perfection of the liturgy\".{{harv|Thompson|1961|p=378}}\n\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer (1662).jpg|thumb|left|Title page of the 1662 Prayer Book]]\nThe Savoy Conference ended in disagreement late in July 1661, but the initiative in prayer book revision had already passed to the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocations]] and from there to Parliament.{{harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=192f}} The Convocations made some 600 changes, mostly of details, which were \"far from partisan or extreme\".{{harv|Spurr|1991|p=40}}  However, Edwards states that more of the changes suggested by high Anglicans were implemented (though by no means all {{harv|Edwards|1983| p=312}}) and Spurr comments that (except in the case of the Ordinal) the suggestions of the \"Laudians\" ([[John Cosin|Cosin]] and [[Matthew Wren]]) were not taken up possibly due to the influence of moderates such as Sanderson and Reynolds. For example, the inclusion in the intercessions of the Communion rite of prayer for the dead was proposed and rejected. The introduction of \"Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth\" remained unaltered and only a thanksgiving for those \"departed this life in thy faith and fear\" was inserted to introduce the petition that the congregation might be \"given grace so to follow their good examples that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom\". Griffith Thomas commented that the retention of the words \"militant here in earth\" defines the scope of this petition: we pray for ourselves, we thank God for them, and adduces collateral evidence to this end.{{harv|Griffith Thomas|1963|pp=508\u2013521}} Secondly, an attempt was made to restore the [[Offertory]]. This was achieved by the insertion of the words \"and oblations\" into the prayer for the Church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the table (instead of being put in the poor box) and the bread and wine placed upon the table. Previously it had not been clear when and how bread and wine got onto the altar. The so-called \"manual acts\", whereby the priest took the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration, which had been deleted in 1552, were restored; and an \"amen\" was inserted after the words of institution and before communion, hence separating the connections between consecration and communion which Cranmer had tried to make. After communion, the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away for the priest's own use. By such subtle means were Cranmer's purposes further confused, leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite. One change made that constituted a concession to the Presbyterian Exceptions, was the updating and re-insertion of the so-called \"[[Black Rubric]]\", which had been removed in 1559. This now declared that kneeling in order to receive communion did not imply adoration of the species of the Eucharist nor \"to any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood\"\u2014which, according to the rubric, were in heaven, not here.\n\nUnable to accept the new book, 936 ministers were deprived. ({{harvnb| Spurr| 1991| p=43}}: {{efn|Widely varying figures are quoted. {{harvtxt|Procter|Frere|1902}} gave 2000; {{harvtxt|Neill|1960|p=165}},1760. Spurr gives the following breakdown for the period 1660\u201363: Total ministers forced out of English parishes about 1760. This includes 695 parish ministers ejected under the 1660 act for settling clergy; 936 more forced out under the 1662 Act of Uniformity. In addition 200 non-parochial ministers from lectureships, universities and schools, and 120 in Wales were excluded. He adds that 171 of the 1760 are \"known to have conformed later\". In a footnote he cites {{harvtxt|Pruett|1978|p=17,18,23}}.}} ) In effect, the 1662 Prayer Book marked the end of a period of just over 100 years, when a common form of liturgy served for almost all reformed public worship in England and the start of the continuing division between [[Anglican]]s and [[Nonconformist]]s.{{harv|Edwards|1983| p=313}} The actual language of the 1662 revision was little changed from that of Cranmer. With two exceptions, some words and phrases which had become archaic were modernised; secondly, the readings for the [[epistle]] and [[gospel]] at Holy Communion, which had been set out in full since 1549, were now set to the text of the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible. The [[Psalter]], which had not been printed in the 1549, 1552 or 1559 books\u2014was in 1662 provided in [[Miles Coverdale]]'s translation from the [[Great Bible]] of 1538.\n\nIt was this edition which was to be the official ''Book of Common Prayer'' during the growth of the British Empire and, as a result, has been a great influence on the prayer books of Anglican churches worldwide, [[Liturgy|liturgies]] of other denominations in English, and of the English people and language as a whole.\n\n===Further attempts at revision===\n\n====1662\u20131832====\n[[File:1689 Prayerbook Collect for 5 November.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A Collect for 5 November in the ''Book of Common Prayer'' published in London in 1689, referring to the [[Gunpowder Plot]] and the arrival of [[William III of England|William III]].]]\nBetween 1662 and the 19th century, further attempts to revise the ''Book'' in England stalled <!--Too colloquial?: ; that [they] did was, however, a bit of a close-run thing-->. On the death of Charles II, his brother James, a Roman Catholic, became [[James II of England|James II]]. James wished to achieve toleration for those of his own Roman Catholic faith, whose practices were still banned. This, however, drew the Presbyterians closer to the Church of England in their common desire to resist 'popery'; talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air. But with the flight of James in 1688 and the arrival of the Calvinist [[William III of England|William of Orange]] the position of the parties changed. The Presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to Roman Catholics and without, therefore, their having to submit to the Church of England, even with a liturgy more acceptable to them. They were now in a much stronger position to demand changes that were ever more radical. [[John Tillotson]], Dean of Canterbury pressed the king to set up a commission to produce such a revision {{harv|Fawcett|1973| p=26}}. The so-called ''Liturgy of Comprehension'' of 1689, which was the result, conceded two thirds of the Presbyterian demands of 1661; but, when it came to [[convocation]] the members, now more fearful of William's perceived agenda, did not even discuss it and its contents were, for a long time, not even accessible {{harv|Fawcett|1973| p=45}}. This work, however, did go on to influence the prayer books of many British colonies.\n\n====1833\u20131906====\n[[File:Edward Bouverie Pusey.jpg|thumb|left|215px|[[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], a leader of the [[Oxford Movement]].]]\nBy the 19th century, pressures to revise the 1662 book were increasing. Adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]], begun in 1833, raised questions about the relationship of the Church of England to the apostolic church and thus about its forms of worship. Known as [[Tractarians]] after their production of ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'' on theological issues, they advanced the case for the Church of England being essentially a part of the \"Western Church\", of which the Roman Catholic Church was the chief representative. The illegal use of elements of the Roman rite, the use of candles, vestments and incense \u2013&nbsp;practices collectively known as [[Ritualism in the Church of England|Ritualism]]&nbsp;\u2013 had become widespread and led to the establishment of a new system of discipline, intending to bring the \"Romanisers\" into conformity, through the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]] {{harv|Carpenter|1933|p=234}}. The Act had no effect on illegal practices: five clergy were imprisoned for contempt of court and after the trial of the much loved Bishop [[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]] of Lincoln, it became clear that some revision of the liturgy had to be embarked upon {{harv|Carpenter|1933|p=246}}.\n\nOne branch of the Ritualism movement argued that both \"Romanisers\" and their Evangelical opponents, by imitating, respectively, the Church of Rome and Reformed churches, transgressed the Ornaments Rubric of 1559 (\"...that such Ornaments of the Church, and of the Ministers thereof, at all Times of their Ministration, shall be retained, and be in use, as were in this Church of England, by the Authority of Parliament, in the Second Year of the Reign of King Edward the Sixth\"). These adherents of ritualism, among whom were [[Percy Dearmer]] and others, claimed that the Ornaments Rubric prescribed the ritual usages of the [[Sarum Rite]] with the exception of a few minor things already abolished by the early reformation.\n\nFollowing a Royal Commission report in 1906, work began on a new prayer book. It took twenty years to complete, prolonged partly due to the demands of the [[First World War]] and partly in the light of the 1920 constitution of the Church Assembly, which \"perhaps not unnaturally wished to do the work all over again for itself\" {{harv|Neill|1960|p=395}}.\n\n====1906\u20132000====\n{{see|1928 Prayer Book}}\nIn 1927, the work on a new version of the prayer book reached its final form. In order to reduce conflict with traditionalists, it was decided that the form of service to be used would be determined by each congregation. With these open guidelines, the book was granted approval by the Church of England Convocations and Church Assembly in July 1927. However, it was defeated by the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] in 1928.\n\nThe effect of the failure of the 1928 book was salutary: no further attempts were made to revise the ''Book of Common Prayer''. Instead a different process, that of producing an alternative book, led to the publication of Series 1, 2 and 3 in the 1960s, the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]] and subsequently to the 2000 ''[[Common Worship]]'' series of books. Both differ substantially from the ''Book of Common Prayer,'' though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service, largely along the lines proposed for the 1928 Prayer Book. Order One follows the pattern of the modern [[Liturgical Movement]].\n\n==In the Anglican Communion==\n\nWith British colonial expansion from the 17th century onwards, Anglicanism spread across the globe. The new Anglican churches used and revised the use of the ''Book of Common Prayer'', until they, like the English church, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries which come under the general heading of the [[Liturgical Movement]].\n\n===Africa===\n\nIn South Africa a ''Book of Common Prayer''  was \"Set Forth by Authority for Use in the [[Church of the Province of South Africa]]\" in 1954. This prayerbook is still in use in some churches Southern Africa, however it has been largely replaced by ''An Anglican Prayerbook -1989'' and its translations to the other languages in use in Southern Africa.\n\n===Asia===\n\n====China and Hong Kong====\nThe ''Book of Common Prayer'' is translated literally as {{lang|zh|\u516c\u79b1\u66f8}} in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]: ''G\u014dng d\u01ceo sh\u016b''; [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]: ''G\u016bng t\u00f3u sy\u016b''). The former dioceses in the now defunct [[Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui]] had their own Book of Common Prayer. The General Synod and the College of Bishops of Chung Hwa Sheng Kung Hui planned to publish a unified version for the use of all Anglican churches in China in 1949, which was the 400th anniversary of the first publishing of the ''Book of Common Prayer''. After the communists took over mainland China, the '''[[Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao|Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao]]''' became independent of the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui, and continued to use the edition issued in Shanghai in 1938 with a revision in 1959. This edition, also called the \"Black-Cover Book of Common Prayer\" \u9ed1\u76ae\u516c\u79b1\u66f8 because of its black cover, still remains in use after the establishment of the '''[[Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui]]''' (Anglican province in Hong Kong). The language style of \"Black-Cover Book of Common Prayer\" is closer to [[Classical Chinese]] than contemporary Chinese.\n\n====India====\nThe '''[[Church of South India]]''' was the first modern Episcopal uniting church, consisting as it did, from its foundation in 1947, at the time of Indian independence, of Anglicans, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Reformed Christians. Its liturgy, from the first, combined the free use of Cranmer's language with an adherence to the principles of congregational participation and the centrality of the Eucharist, much in line with the Liturgical Movement. Because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non-Christian culture (except in [[Kerala]], where Christianity has a long history), practice varied wildly.\n\n====Japan====\nThe BCP is called '''\"Kit\u014dsho\"''' ({{Lang-ja|\u7948\u7977\u66f8}}) in Japanese. The initial effort to compile such a book in Japanese goes back to 1859 when the [[Christian mission|missionary societies]] of the [[Church of England]] and of the [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] started their work in Japan, later joined by the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] in 1888.

In the fifty years after World War II, there were several efforts to translate the Bible into modern [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] Japanese, the most recent of which was the publication in 1990 of the [[Japanese New Interconfessional Translation Bible]]. The ''Kit\u014dsho'' using the colloquial Japanese language and [[horizontal writing]] was published in the same year.  It also used the [[Revised Common Lectionary]].

In 1994, the prayers announced \"allowed\" by the 1982 Bishops Council of the Anglican Church of Korea was published in a second version of the ''Book of Common Prayers'' In 2004, the National Anglican Council published the third and the current Book of Common Prayers known as \"seong-gong-hwe gi-do-seo (\uc131\uacf5\ud68c\uae30\ub3c4\uc11c)\" or the \"Anglican Prayers\", including the Daily Masses, Special Masses, Baptism, Confirmation, Funeral Mass, Wedding Mass, Rite of Ordination Mass, and all of the other events the Anglican Church of Korea celebrates.\nThe Diction of the books has changed from the 1965 version to the 2004 version. For example, the word \"God\" has changed from classical Chinese term \"Cheon-ju (\ucc9c\uc8fc)\" to native Korean word \"ha-neu-nim (\ud558\ub290\ub2d8),\" in accordance with to the Public Christian translation, and as used in 1994 Common Translation Bible (gong-dong beon-yeok-seong-seo) that the Church currently uses.\n\n====Philippines====\n[[File:Book of Common Prayers in a Church in Sagda.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Philippine ''Book of Common Prayer'' in the Church of Saint Mary, [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]], [[Mountain Province]], Philippines.]]\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer Chinese-English Diglot.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[diglot]]ic English\u2013Chinese ''Book of Common Prayer'' used by the Filipino\u2013Chinese community of [[St. Stephen's Parish, Manila|St Stephen's Pro-Cathedral]] in [[Manila]], Philippines.]]\nAs the Philippines is connected to the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] through the [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines]], the main edition of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in use throughout the islands is the same as that of the United States.\n\nAside from the American version and the newly published Philippine Book of Common Prayer, [[Filipino-Chinese]] congregants of Saint Stephen's Pro-Cathedral in the [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines#Dioceses|Diocese of the Central Philippines]] uses the English-Chinese ''Diglot Book of Common Prayer'', published by the Episcopal Church of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe ECP has since published its own Book of Common Prayer upon gaining full autonomy on 1 May 1990.

It was founded in 1880 and since 1980 has been an [[Extra-provincial Anglican churches|extra-provincial church]] under the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan authority]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

A translation by [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]], bishop of [[St David's]] and the scholar [[William Salesbury]] was published in 1567{{harv|Procter|Frere |1902|p=125}} by [[Humphrey Toy]] as ''Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin''. A new revision&nbsp;\u2014 based on the 1662 English revision and probably by [[George Griffith (bishop)|George Griffith]], Bishop of [[St Asaph]]&nbsp;- was published in 1664.{{harv|Muss-Arnolt|1914|loc=Ch VII}}  The 1662 book and its Welsh equivalent continued to be used,{{cn|date=April 2017}} even after the [[Church in Wales]] was disestablished in 1920.\n\nThe Church in Wales began revising the book of Common Prayer in the 1950s. The first material authorised for experimental use was a lectionary in 1956, followed by a baptism and confirmation service in 1958, an order for Holy matrimony in 1960, and an order for the burial of the Dead in 1962. These did not however enjoy widespread use. In 1966 an experimental order for the Holy Eucharist was authorised. This was the first to enjoy widespread use. Revision continued throughout the 60s and 70s with an experimental version of morning and evening prayer in 1969. In 1971 a definitive version of baptism and confirmation was authorised replacing the equivalent in the 1662 book of Common Prayer. This was followed in 1974 with a definitive order for the burial of the Dead and in 1975 with a definitive order for Holy matrimony. It was hoped that a new book of Common Prayer for the church in Wales would be produced in 1981. This hope suffered a major setback in 1979 when a definitive version of the Holy Eucharist failed to gain a two-thirds majority in the house of clergy and the house of laity at the Governing Body. A light revision of the 1966 experimental Eucharist did get through the Governing Body and the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales was authorised in 1984. This Prayer Book is unique in that it is in traditional English. The Church in Wales first considered a modern language Eucharist in the early 70s but this received a lukewarm reception. A modern language Eucharist (The Holy Eucharist in modern language) was authorised alongside the new prayer book in 1984 but this did not enjoy widespread use. In 1990 new initiation services were authorised followed in 1992 by an alternative order for morning and evening prayer in 1994 by an alternative order for the holy Eucharist and in 1995 by the alternative calendar lectionary and collects. These enjoyed widespread use. In 2003 a new calendar and collects was made part of the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales. This was followed in 2004 by an order for the holy Eucharist, Services for Christian initiation in 2006 and in 2009 by daily prayer. Experimental services continued with an ordinal was produced in 2004, Ministry to the sick and housebound in 2007, healing services in 2008, Funeral services in 2009, and in 2010 marriage services which became part of the Book of Common Prayer in 2013. The ordinal was made part of the prayer book the following year. In 2017 prayers for a child were produced which are only available online.<ref>https://www.churchinwales.org.uk/structure/representative-body/publications/liturgy/child-prayers-for-a/</ref>\n\n====Isle of Man====\nThe first [[Manx language|Manx]] translation of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was made by [[John Phillips (Bishop of Sodor and Man)]] in 1610. A more successful \"New Version\" by his successor [[Mark Hiddesley]] was in use until 1824 when English liturgy became universal on the island.{{harv|Muss-Arnolt|1914|loc=Ch VII}}\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Aotearoa, New Zealand, Polynesia====\nAs for other parts of the British Empire, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer was initially the standard of worship for Anglicans in New Zealand. The 1662 Book was first translated into Maori in 1830, and has gone through several translations and a number of different editions since then. The translated 1662 BCP has commonly been called Te Rawiri (\"the David\"), reflecting the prominence of the Psalter in the services of Morning and Evening Prayer, as the Maori often looked for words to be attributed to a person of authority. The Maori translation of the 1662 BCP is still used in New Zealand, particularly among older Maori living in rural areas.\n\nAfter earlier trial services in the mid-twentieth century, in 1988 the '''[[Anglican Church of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia]]''' authorised through its General Synod [http://anglicanprayerbook.nz ''A New Zealand Prayer Book, He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa'']{{cbignore}} intended to serve the needs of New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and the Cook Island Anglicans. \n\nThis book is unusual for its cultural diversity; it includes passages in the Maori, Fijian, Tongan and English languages. In other respects it reflects the same ecumenical influence of the [[Liturgical Movement]] as in other new Anglican books of the period, and borrows freely from a variety of international sources.\n\nThis Book is not presented as a definitive or final liturgical authority, such as use of the definite article in the title might have implied. While the preface is ambiguous regarding the status of older forms and books, the implication however is that this book is now the norm of worship for Anglicans in Aotearoa/New Zealand. \n\nThe Book has has also been revised in a number of minor ways since the initial publication, such as by the inclusion of the [[Revised Common Lectionary]], and an online edition is offered freely as the standard for reference.\n\n====Australia====\nThe '''[[Anglican Church of Australia]]''', known officially, until 1981, as the ''Church of England in Australia and Tasmania'', became self-governing in 1961. Its General Synod agreed that the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was to \"be regarded as the authorised standard of worship and doctrine in this Church\". After a series of experimental services offered in many dioceses during the 1960s and 70s, in 1978, ''An Australian Prayer Book'' was produced, formally as a supplement to the Book of 1662, although in fact it was widely taken up in place of the old Book. The AAPB sought to adhere to the principle that, where the Liturgical Committee could not agree on a formulation, the words or expressions of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' were to be used {{harv|The Church of England in Australia Trust Corporation|1978}}, if in a modern idiom. The result was a conservative revision, including two forms of eucharistic rite: a First Order that was essentially the 1662 rite in more contemporary language, and a Second Order that reflected the [[Liturgical Movement]] norms, but without elements such as a eucharistic epiclesis or other features that would have represented a departure from the doctrine of the old Book.\n\n''A Prayer Book for Australia'', produced in 1995 and again not technically a substitute for 1662, nevertheless departed from both the structure and wording of the ''Book of Common Prayer'', prompting conservative reaction. Numerous objections were made and the notably conservative evangelical [[Sydney Anglicans|Diocese of Sydney]] drew attention both to the loss of ''BCP'' wording and of an explicit \"biblical doctrine of substitutionary atonement\".{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Sydney delegates to the General Synod sought and obtained various concessions but that Diocese never adopted the Book. The Diocese of Sydney has instead developed its own prayer book, called ''[[Sunday Services]]'', to \"supplement\" the 1662 prayer book (which, as elsewhere in Auatralia, is rarely used), and preserve the original theology which the Sydney diocese asserts has been changed.\n\n===North and Central America===\n\n====Canada====\nThe '''[[Anglican Church of Canada]]''', which until 1955 was known as the Church of England in the Dominion of Canada or simply the Church of England in Canada, developed its first Book of Common Prayer separately from the English version in 1918, which received final authorization from General Synod on April 16, 1922.{{harv|Armitage|1922|p=}} The revision of 1959 was much more substantial, bearing a family relationship to that of the abortive 1928 book in England. The language was conservatively modernized, and additional seasonal material was added. As in England, while many prayers were retained though the structure of the Communion service was altered: a Prayer of Oblation was added to the Eucharistic prayer after the 'words of institution', thus reflecting the rejection of Cranmer's theology in liturgical developments across the Anglican Communion. More controversially, the Psalter included in the book omitted certain sections, including the entirety of Psalm 58. (According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090903180111/http://www.prayerbook.ca:80/bcp/psalmstables.html Tables of Proper Psalms]{{cbignore}}, \"The following passages in the Psalter as hitherto used are omitted: Psalm 14. 5-7; 55. 16; 58 (all); 68. 21-23; 69. 23-29; 104. 35 (in part); 109. 5-19; 136. 27; 137. 7-9; 140. 9-10; 141. 7-8. The verses are renumbered.\" See also the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090521143044/http://prayerbook.ca:80/bcp/psalter.html Psalter from 1962 Canadian Book of Common Prayer]{{cbignore}}). General Synod gave final authorization to the revision in 1962, to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. A French translation, ''Le Recueil des Pri\u00e8res de la Communaut\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tienne'', was published in 1967.\n\nAfter a period of experimentation with the publication of various supplements, the ''[[Book of Alternative Services]]'' was published in 1985. This book (which owes much to Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and other sources) has widely supplanted the 1959 book, though the latter remains authorized. As in other places, there has been a reaction and the Canadian version of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' has found supporters.\n\n====Indigenous languages====\nThe ''Book of Common Prayer'' has also been translated into these North American indigenous languages: Cowitchan, Cree, Haida, Ntlakyapamuk, Slavey, Eskimo-Aleut, Dakota, Delaware, Mohawk, Ojibwe.{{efn| See {{cite web |last=Wohlers |first=Charles |title=The Book of Common Prayer in other Languages |work=The Book of Common Prayer |accessdate=2008-10-15 |date=2008-09-23 |url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/languages.html}} }}\n\n=====Ojibwa=====\n[[Joseph Gilfillan]] was the chief editor of the 1911 [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwa]] edition of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' entitled ''Iu Wejibuewisi Mamawi Anamiawini Mazinaigun'' (''Iw Wejibwewizi Maamawi-anami'aawini Mazina'igan'') {{harv|Wohlers|2007 |loc=Chapter 68}}.\n\n====United States====\n\n[[File:1979 BCP title.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|The 1979 Book of Common Prayer]]\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, the first church in the American colonies having been founded in 1607 {{harv|Cross|Livingstone|1975}}. The first Book of Common Prayer of the new body, approved in 1789, had as its main source the 1662 English book, with significant influence also from the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which [[Samuel Seabury (1729\u20131796)|Bishop Seabury]] of Connecticut brought to the USA following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784. \n\nThe preface to the 1789 Book of Common Prayer says, \"this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require.\" There were some notable differences. For example, in the Communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the Scottish orders derived from 1549 {{harv|Shepherd|1965|loc=82}} and found in the 1764 Book of Common Prayer. The compilers also used other materials derived from ancient liturgies especially Eastern Orthodox ones such as the Liturgy of St. James.{{harv|Shepherd|1965|loc=82}} An [[epiclesis]] or invocation of the Holy Spirit in the eucharistic prayer was included, as in the Scottish book, though modified to meet reformist objections. Overall however, the book was modelled on the English Prayer Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at more radical deletion and revision.{{harv|McGarvey|Gibson|1907}} The 1789 American BCP reintroduced explicit sacrificial language in the Prayer of Consecration by adding the words \"which we now offer unto Thee\", after \"with these thy holy gifts\" from the 1549 BCP. The insertion undid Cranmer's rejection in his second book of 1552 of the Eucharist as a material sacrifice by which the Church offers itself to God in an unbloody liturgical representation in and with the very same sacrifice of Christ who is both priest and victim, both offering and offered. This reworking thereby aligned the church's eucharistic theology more closely to that of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.\n\nFurther revisions occurred in 1892 and 1928, in which minor changes were made, removing, for instance, some of [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]]'s Exhortations and introducing such innovations as prayers for the dead.\n\nIn 1979, a more substantial revision was made under the influence of the [[Liturgical Movement]]. Its most distinctive feature may be the presentation of two rites for the Holy Eucharist and for Morning and Evening Prayer. The Rite I services keep most of the language of the 1928 and older books, while Rite II uses contemporary language and offers a mixture of newly composed texts, some adapted from the older forms, and some borrowed from other sources, notably Byzantine rites. The Book also offers changed rubrics and the shapes of the services, which were generally made for both the traditional and contemporary language versions.\n\nArticle X of the Canons of the Episcopal Church provides that \"[t]he Book of Common Prayer, as now established or hereafter amended by the authority of this Church, shall be in use in all the Dioceses of this Church,\" which, of course, is a reference to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.{{efn|Some parishes continued to use the 1928 book either regularly or occasionally, for pastoral sensitivity, for doctrinal reasons and for the beauty of its language.

In 1991 The Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont, PA published a book entitled, the ''[[Anglican Service Book]]'' which is \"a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and Additional Devotions.\" In 2000, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church]] issued an apology to those \"offended or alienated during the time of liturgical transition to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.\" \n\nThe Prayer Book Cross was erected in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in 1894 as a gift from the [[Church of England]].{{efn|A picture of the Prayer Book Cross can be seen at{{cite web|url=http://www.lightight.com/GGP/mem_images/Mem3P02.html |title=Prayer Book Cross |accessdate=2008-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211102722/http://www.lightight.com/GGP/mem_images/Mem3P02.html |archivedate=2005-02-11 |df= }}  }} Created by [[Ernest Coxhead]], it stands on one of the higher points in Golden Gate Park. It is located between John F. Kennedy Drive and Park Presidio Drive, near Cross Over Drive. This {{convert|57|ft|m|abbr=on}} sandstone cross commemorates the first use of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in California by Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s chaplain on June 24, 1579.\n\n==Roman Catholic adaptations==\n\nIn 2003, a Roman Catholic liturgical book, the ''[[Book of Divine Worship]]'', was published in the United States. The book's development began in the early 1980s for former Anglicans within the [[Anglican Use]] parishes in the USA. It was published in a single volume, primarily for their own use, in 2003. The book is composed of  material drawn from the proposed 1928 BCP, the 1979 ''Book of Common Prayer'' of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] and the [[Roman Missal]]. Since 2011, the ''Book of Divine Worship'' has undergone additional revision to bring it more coherently in line with the language of the American BCP, while also incorporating elements of the English Missal and the Anglican Missal. The updated edition was mandated for use in all [[personal ordinariate]]s for former Anglicans in the USA from Advent 2013, although further revision is expected to incorporate most of the BCP propers as well.\n\n==Religious influence==\n\nThe ''Book of Common Prayer'' has had a great influence on a number of other denominations. While theologically different, the language and flow of the service of many other churches owe a great debt to the prayer book. In particular, many Christian prayer books have drawn on the [[Collect]]s for the Sundays of the Church Year\u2014mostly freely translated or even \"rethought\" {{harv|Neill|1960|p=69}} by Cranmer from a wide range of Christian traditions, but including a number of original compositions\u2014which are widely recognized as masterpieces of compressed liturgical construction.\n\n[[John Wesley]], an Anglican priest whose revivalist preaching led to the creation of [[Methodism]] wrote in his preface to ''The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America'' (1784), \"I believe there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety than the Common Prayer of the Church of England.\" cited in {{harvtxt|Westerfield Tucker|2006|p=209}} Many Methodist churches in England and the United States continued to use a slightly revised version of the book for communion services well into the 20th century. In the [[United Methodist Church]], the liturgy for Eucharistic celebrations is almost identical to what is found in the ''Book of Common Prayer'', as are some of the other liturgies and services.\n\nA unique variant was developed in 1785 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] when the historic [[King's Chapel]] (founded 1686) left the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and became an independent [[Unitarianism|Unitarian church]]. To this day, King's Chapel uniquely uses ''The Book of Common Prayer According to the Use in King's Chapel'' in its worship.\n\n==Literary influence==\n\nTogether with the [[King James Version]] of the Bible and the works of [[Shakespeare]], the ''Book of Common Prayer'' has been one of the three fundamental underpinnings of modern English. As it has been in regular use for centuries, many phrases from its services have passed into everyday English, either as deliberate quotations or as unconscious borrowings. They have often been used metaphorically in non-religious contexts, and authors have used phrases from the prayer book as titles for their books.\n{{Quote box\n |title = The Form of Solemnization of Matrimony\n |quote = ... Therefore if any man can shew any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now '''speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace''' ...\n |align = right\n |width = 50%\n}}\n{{Quote box\n |title = The Second Sunday in Advent - The Collect\n |quote = Blessed Lord, who hast caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning: Grant that we may in such wise hear them, '''read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest''' them, that by patience and comfort of thy holy Word, we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which thou hast given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.\n |align = right\n |width = 50%\n}}\nSome examples of well-known phrases from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' are:\n*\"Speak now or forever hold your peace\" from the [[marriage]] liturgy.\n*\"Till death us do part\", from the marriage liturgy.{{efn|The phrase \"till death us do part\" (\"till death us depart\" before 1662) has been changed to \"till death do us part\" in some more recent prayer books, such as the 1962 Canadian Book of Common Prayer.}}\n*\"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust\" from the [[funeral]] service.\n*\"From all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil\" from the [[litany]].\n*\"Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest\" from the [[collect]] for the second Sunday of [[Advent]].\n*\"Evil liver\" from the rubrics for Holy Communion.\n*\"All sorts and conditions of men\" from the Order for Morning Prayer.\n*\"Peace [[Peace for our time|in our time]]\" from Morning Prayer, Versicles.\n{{clear}}\n\nReferences and allusions to Prayer Book services in the works of Shakespeare were tracked down and identified by Richmond Noble {{harv|Noble|1935| p = 82}}. Derision of the Prayer Book or its contents \"in any interludes, plays, songs, rhymes, or by other open words\" was a criminal offence under the 1559 [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]], and consequently Shakespeare avoids too direct reference; but Noble particularly identifies the reading of the Psalter according to the [[Great Bible]] version specified in the Prayer Book, as the biblical book generating the largest number of [[Biblical allusions in Shakespeare|Biblical references]] in Shakespeare's plays. Noble found a total of 157 allusions to the Psalms in the plays of the [[First Folio]], relating to 62 separate Psalms\u2014all, save one, of which he linked to the version in the Psalter, rather than those in the [[Geneva Bible]] or [[Bishops' Bible]]. In addition, there are a small number of direct allusions to liturgical texts in the Prayer Book; e.g. Henry VIII 3:2 where Wolsey states \"Vain Pomp and Glory of this World, I hate ye!\", a clear reference to the rite of Public Baptism; where the Godparents are asked \"Doest thou forsake the vaine pompe and glory of the worlde..?\"\n\nAs novelist [[P. D. James]] observed, \"We can recognize the Prayer Book\u2019s cadences in the works of [[Isaac Walton]] and [[John Bunyan]], in the majestic phrases of [[John Milton]], [[Sir Thomas Browne]] and [[Edward Gibbon]]. We can see its echo in the works of such very different writers as [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], the [[Bront\u00eb family|Bront\u00ebs]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and even [[Dorothy L. Sayers]].\" {{harv|James|2011|p=48}} James herself used phrases from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' and made them into bestselling titles \u2013 ''[[Devices and Desires]]'' and ''[[The Children of Men]]'' \u2013 while [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]]'s 2006 film ''[[Children of Men]]'' placed the phrase onto cinema marquees worldwide.\n\n==Copyright status==\nIn England there are only three bodies entitled to print the ''Book of Common Prayer'': the two [[privileged presses]] ([[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Oxford University Press]]), and The [[Queen's Printer]]. Cambridge University Press holds [[letters patent]] as The Queen's Printer and so two of these three bodies are the same. The Latin term ''{{lang|la|cum privilegio}}'' (''with privilege'') is printed on the title pages of Cambridge editions of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (and the King James Version of the Bible) to denote the charter authority or privilege under which they are published.\n\nThe primary function for Cambridge University Press in its role as Queen\u2019s Printer is preserving the integrity of the text, continuing a long-standing tradition and reputation for textual scholarship and accuracy of printing. Cambridge University Press has stated that as a university press, a charitable enterprise devoted to the advancement of learning, it has no desire to restrict artificially that advancement, and that commercial restrictiveness through a partial monopoly is not part of its purpose. It therefore grants permission to use the text, and license printing or the importation for sale within the UK, as long as it is assured of acceptable quality and accuracy.{{efn| See {{cite web|title=The Queen's Printer's Patent|url=http://www.cambridge.org/about-us/who-we-are/queens-printers-patent/|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2016-03-20}} }}\n\nThe Church of England, supported by the [[Prayer Book Society (England)|Prayer Book Society]], publishes an online edition of the Book of Common Prayer with permission of Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn accordance with Canon II.3.6(b)(2) of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], the church relinquishes any copyright for the version of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' currently adopted by the Convention of the church (although the text of proposed revisions remains copyrighted).{{efn|See the {{cite web|title=Constitution & Canons|url=https://extranet.generalconvention.org/staff/files/download/15057.pdf|website=generalconvention.org|publisher=The General Convention of the Episcopal Church|accessdate=2016-03-20}} }}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anglicanism}}\n* [[Anglican devotions]]\n* [[Prayer Book Rebellion]]\n* [[Prayer Book Society of Canada]]\n* [[The Books of Homilies]]\n\n==Editions==\n<!--We need to cite the various BCP text editions and variations.

It is usually the size and shape of a ''[[katana]]'', but is sometimes shaped like other [[sword]]s, such as the ''[[wakizashi]]'' and ''[[tant\u014d]]''. Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings.  Sometimes it is spelled \"boken\" in English.\n''Bokken'' should not be confused with ''[[shinai]]'', practice swords made of flexible bamboo.\n\n==History==\n''Bokken'' were designed to lessen the damage caused by fighting with real swords and were used for the training of [[samurai]] warriors in feudal Japan. Bokken eventually became lethal weapons themselves in the hands of trained experts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ratti|first1=Oscar|last2=Westbrook|first2=Adele|title=Secrets of the Samurai; A Survey of the Martial Arts of Feudal Japan|date=1991|publisher=C.E.

In a famous legend, he defeated [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d|Sasaki Kojiro]] with a bokken he had carved from an [[oar]] while traveling on a boat to the [[Ganry\u016bjima|predetermined island]] for the duel.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William Scott|title=The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi|date=2004|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=9784770029423|page=19|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0p0C7Y8lkH8C&pg=PA18&dq=musashi+came+late+and+unkempt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Nv-UT--UBomC8ATMqsn9Aw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=musashi%20came%20late%20and%20unkempt&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is hard to determine precisely when the first Bokken appeared due to the nature of secrecy in ancient martial arts training, the oldest Bokken known to have been used as training tools date from the Edo period. Before the Meiji era, Bokken very likely manufactured by woodworkers not specialized in Bokken manufacture. It is at the beginning of the 20th century that Bokken manufacture started, mainly in Miyakonojo (Kyushu region). Today, the last four workshops of Japan are still located in Miyakonojo.\n\nThe \"standard Bokken\", mostly used in Kendo and Aikido was created by master Aramaki in collaboration with the All Japan Kendo Federation in the 50's and was the first standardized Bokken ever created. <ref>{{Citation|last=Seido - Budo Equipment & Practice in Japan|title=[Interview] Aramaki Yasuo - Bokken Manufacture 3rd Generation Craftsman (Part 1/2)|date=2017-10-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvbS_4p7Jy8|accessdate=2018-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Several bokken.jpg|thumb|130px|Various styles of bokken]]\nThe ''bokken'' is used as an inexpensive and relatively safe substitute for a real sword in several [[martial arts]] such as ''[[aikido]]'', ''[[kendo]]'',  ''[[iaido]]'', ''[[kenjutsu]]'' and ''[[jodo]]''. Its simple wooden construction demands less care and maintenance than a katana. In addition, training with a bokken does not carry the same mortal risk associated with that of a sharp metal sword, both for the user and other practitioners nearby. While its use has several advantages over use of a live edged weapon, it can still be deadly, and any training with a bokken should be done with due care. Injuries occurring from bokken are very similar to those caused by clubs and similar battering weapons and include compound fractures, ruptured organs, and other such blunt force injuries. In some ways, a bokken can be more dangerous as the injuries caused are often unseen and inexperienced practitioners may underestimate the risk of harm. It is not a sparring weapon, but is intended to be used in [[kata]] and to acclimate the student to the feel of a real sword. For sparring, a bamboo [[shinai]] is typically used instead for obvious safety reasons.\n\nIn 2003, the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] (AJKF) introduced a set of basic exercises using a ''bokuto'' called ''Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho''. This form of practice is intended primarily for kendo practitioners up to [[Dan (rank)#Ranks in Japanese|Nidan]] ranking, but can be beneficial for all kendo students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zenkenren-shop.com/jp/kendo/book.html#010110 |title=\u5168\u65e5\u672c\u5263\u9053\u9023\u76df\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a\u5263\u9053\u66f8\u7c4d |publisher=Zenkenren-shop.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}</ref>\n\n''[[Suburito]]'' are ''bokken'' designed for use in ''[[suburi]]''. ''Suburi'', literally \"bare swinging,\" are solo cutting exercises. Suburito are thicker and heavier than normal ''bokken'' and users of suburito must therefore develop both strength and technique. Their weight makes them unsuitable for paired practice and solo forms. One famous user of the suburi-sized bokken is [[Miyamoto Musashi]] who used one in his duel against [[Sasaki Kojiro]].\n\nAs late as 2015, bokken were issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/lapd_equipment |title=LAPD Equipment - Los Angeles Police Department |publisher=Lapdonline.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Holly|title=Mounted Patrols Train for Handling Unrest at Convention|page=N3|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=August 6, 2000}}</ref><!-- April 8, 2011 - The August 6, 2000 Daily News cite is only for that the bokken were issued. It does not confirm that they are for use as batons. The Daily News article itself only has \"The officers are also trained to use a bokken, a long wooden sword used only by mounted police.\" The LAPD's Mounted Unit is currently overseen by Captain Incontro (see http://www.lapdonline.org/metropolitan_division). I contacted him via e-mail and asked if the Wikipedia article claim \"Bokken are currently issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons\" was true. He replied back with \"We do use the bokken.\" -->\n\n==Types of bokken==\nBokken can be made to represent any style of weapon required such as [[nagamaki]], [[Nodachi|no-dachi]], [[yari]], [[naginata]], [[kama (weapon)|kama]], etc. The most widely used styles are:\n\n* ''dait\u014d'' or ''tachi'' ([[katana]]-sized), long sword\n* ''shoto'' or ''kodachi'' or ''wakizashi bo'', short sword, ([[wakizashi]]-sized)\n* ''tant\u014d bo'' ([[tant\u014d]]-sized)\n* ''suburito'' can be made in ''dait\u014d'' and ''shoto'' sizes\n\nAdditionally, various [[koryu]] (traditional Japanese martial arts) have their own distinct styles of bokken which can vary slightly in length, tip shape, or in whether or not a tsuba (hilt guard) is added.\n\nThe [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] specify the dimensions of ''bokken'' for use in the modern kendo kata, called ''Nippon kendo kata''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zenkenren-shop.com/en/eigo/index.html#050106 |title=AJKF Online-shop : English version |publisher=Zenkenren-shop.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}</ref>\n*[[Tachi]]: Total length, approx. 102&nbsp;cm; ''tsuka'' (handle) approx. 24&nbsp;cm.\n*[[Kodachi]]: Total length, approx. 55&nbsp;cm; ''tsuka'' (handle) approx. 14&nbsp;cm.\n\n==Bokken in fiction==\nBokken have been depicted in film, manga, anime, and comic books.\n\n*In the film ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', the bokken is seen in multiple instances. In one scene a group of children are playing/sparring with them. Later in the film, Nathan Algren (played by [[Tom Cruise]]) is seen undergoing sword training with a bokken.\n*In Hiroyuki Takei's manga and anime series ''[[Shaman King]]'', Umemiya Ryunosuke possesses a wooden sword and uses it as his main weapon, and is accordingly known as \"Wooden Sword\" Ryu.\n*In the anime \"[[Outlaw Star]]\"  Twilight Suzuka utilizes a bokken with immense skill and is able to use it more efficiently than an actual sword.\n*In the anime \"[[Demon City Shinjuku]]\", the hero Kyoya Izayoi wields a bokken which he can infuse with spiritual energy.\n*In the [[Wolverine (comic book)|''Wolverine'' limited series]] (1982) by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, Wolverine is nearly killed by [[Shingen Yashida]], using a bokken to deliver nerve strikes.\n*In the anime and the manga, ''[[Gin Tama]]'', the protagonist, [[Gintoki Sakata]], uses a bokken as his main weapon. His skills with it are powerful enough to overpower even real swords.\n*In the anime and manga, ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', [[Kamiya Kaoru]] uses a bokken as her main weapon.\n*In the anime and light novel series, ''[[Toradora!]]'', Aisaka Taiga can be seen wielding a bokken.\n*In the anime and manga, ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]'', [[Kuno Tatewaki]] wields a bokken and occasionally a [[shinai]].\n*In the anime and manga, ''[[Highschool of the Dead]]'', [[List of Highschool of the Dead characters#Saeko Busujima|Saeko Busujima]] initially wields a bokken. She replaces it with a katana later in the series.\n*In the anime and manga, ''[[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter|Hunter x Hunter]],'' [[List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters#Kurapika|Kurapika]] wields two ''wakizashi''-sized bokken attached via rope.

It was formed by a group of fourteen gunsmith members of the Birmingham Small Arms Trade Association specifically to manufacture guns by machinery. They were encouraged to do this by the [[War Office]] which gave the BSA gunsmiths free access to technical drawings and to the War Office's [[Board of Ordnance]]'s [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] factory at [[Enfield Town|Enfield]]. New machinery developed in the USA installed at Enfield had greatly increased its output without needing more skilled craftsmen.<ref>Taylerson, A. W. F.

P. T. 2002 p. 48\"/> The gun factory proved remarkably  adaptable to the manufacture of cycle parts. What cycles needed was large quantities of standard parts accurately machined at low prices.<ref name=WBSVCH/> In 1880 BSA manufactured the [http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/diwheel/diwheel.htm Otto Dicycle], In the 1880s the company began to manufacture [[safety bicycle]]s on their own account and not until 1905 was the company's first experimental [[motorcycle]] constructed. Bicycle production ceased in 1887 as the company concentrated on producing the [[Lee\u2013Metford]] magazine-loading rifle for the War Office which was re-equipping the British Army with it. The order was for 1,200 rifles per week. BSA recommenced manufacturing bicycles on their own behalf from 1908. BSA Cycles Ltd was set up in 1919 for the manufacture of both bicycles and motorcycles. BSA sold the bicycle business to [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] in 1957 after separating the bicycle and motorcycle business in 1953.\n\n====Bicycle components====\nIn 1893, BSA commenced making bicycle hubs<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/> and continued to supply the cycle trade with bicycle parts up to 1936. BSA bought [[Royal Enfield#history|The Eadie Manufacturing Company]] of Redditch in 1907 and so began to manufacture the Eadie two speed hub gear and the Eadie [[coaster brake]] hub. BSA also signed an agreement with the Three Speed Gear Syndicate in 1907 to manufacture a 3 speed hub under licence. This was later classified as the [[Sturmey Archer]] Type X. BSA introduced a 'Duo' hub in the late 1930s which was capable of one fixed gear and one gear with a freewheel. All BSA hub gear production temporarily ceased in 1939, until they recommenced making their 3 speed hub around 1945. The Eadie coaster hub made a brief return in 1953 on two BSA bicycle models. BSA forever ceased production of their hub gears in 1955.\n\n====Ammunition====\nBSA sold its ammunition business in 1897 to Birmingham Metal and Munitions Company Limited part of the Nobel-Dynamite Trust, through [[Kynoch]] a forerunner of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]].<ref>Ryerson, Barry (1980).

By the autumn of that year BSA was in some difficulty. They had purchased the [[Sparkbrook]] [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] from the War Office, and in return, the War Office undertook to give BSA a quarter of all orders for Lee\u2013Enfield rifles. But, the War Office did not honour their undertaking.<ref>Davenport-Hines, R. P. T. (2002). ''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 49. {{ISBN|0-521-89400-X}}</ref> The ensuing financial crisis did not prevent BSA from signing an agreement to purchase control of bicycle component manufacturer, the Eadie Manufacturing Company of [[Redditch]], on 11 February 1907. That decision was ratified by the shareholders of both companies at separate Extraordinary General Meetings held in the Grand Hotel, Birmingham on 27 February 1907. Albert Eadie became a BSA director, a post he held until his death in 1931.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/>\n\n====Sporting firearms====\nThe very variable military market was now supported by sales of target military rifles, sporting rifles, various patterns of miniature rifles and air rifles. Aperture sights were in demand for [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|Bisley]] and other military rifle meetings.<ref>Birmingham Small Arms Company (Limited). ''The Times'', Thursday, Oct 05, 1911; pg. 15; Issue 39708</ref>\n\n====Motorcycles====\nMotor bicycles were added to bicycle products in 1910.  The BSA 3\u00bd hp was exhibited at the 1910 Olympia Show, London for the 1911 season. The entire BSA production sold out in 1911, 1912 and 1913.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/>\n\n====Motor cars====\n\n=====BSA cars=====\n\n{{Main|BSA cars}}\n\nIn an effort to make use of the Sparkbrook factory BSA established a motorcar department there. An independent part of it was occupied by [[Lanchester Motor Company]]. The first prototype automobile was produced in 1907. The following year, marketed under BSA Cycles Ltd, the company sold 150 automobiles and again began producing complete bicycles on its own account. By 1909 it was clear the new motorcar department was unsuccessful; an investigation committee reported to the BSA Board on the many failures of its management and their poor organisation of production.\n\n=====Daimler cars and trucks=====\n{{Main|Daimler Company}}\n\nDudley Docker had joined the board in 1906 and was appointed deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become the leader of the period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA he started merger talks with [[Daimler Company|The Daimler Company Limited]] of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904 Daimler's profits were 57 per cent and 150 per cent returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders was the apparent stability of BSA.<ref>Davenport-Hines, R. P. T. (2002). ''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior''.

The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated. One of the financial provisions obliged Daimler to pay BSA an annual dividend of \u00a3100,000 representing approximately 40 per cent of the actual cash BSA had put into Daimler. This financial burden deprived Daimler of badly needed cash to fund development, forcing the Daimler company to borrow money from the [[Midland Bank]].<ref>Davenport-Hines, R. P. T. (2002). ''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 51. {{ISBN|0-521-89400-X}}</ref>\n\nBSA had still not recovered financially from the earlier purchase of Royal Small Arms factory at Sparkbrook and BSA were not in a position to finance Daimler, nor had either company ample liquid resources. BSA went ahead with motorcycle production in 1910, their first model available for the 1911 season. In 1913 the BSA group were compelled through pressure from the Midland Bank to make a capital issue of 300,000 preference shares. In the short term this was to solve the liquidity issue but further diluted the group's capitalisation.<ref>Davenport-Hines, R. P. T. (2002). ''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 50-52. {{ISBN|0-521-89400-X}}</ref>\n\nDudley Docker retired as a BSA director in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. Dudley Docker liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered and that of his 1902 merger of [[Metro Cammell|Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Company]] and [[Patent Shaft]]. However, there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler and in view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own using Daimler engines. In 1913 Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles, an indication that things were not well.<ref>Davenport-Hines, R. P. T. (2002).

Holt Thomas was immediately dropped from his new seat on the BSA board and all BSA's new acquisitions were placed in the hands of a liquidator. Some of the businesses were allowed to continue for some years, [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]]'s assets being eventually rolled into Daimler Air Hire to make [[Daimler Airway|Daimler Airway Limited]]. BSA failed to pay a dividend for the following four years while it tried to recover from its losses.<ref>''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior'' R. P. T.

In 1929 a new range of 3- and 4-wheel cars appeared and production of these continued until 1936.\n\nBy the end of 1924 difficult economic conditions left the bulk of BSA profits coming from cars and cycles. There were no sales of arms for military purposes in spite of large new facilities built at Government's request.

International tensions added more activity. An aero engine shadow factory was built and entered production during 1938. Motor cycle sales shrank but BSA maintained its relative position. 1937's new British registrations fell from 57,000 to 46,500. Defence and military equipment including Daimler's Scout car were in heavy demand in Britain and in export markets.<ref>The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited. ''The Times'', Wednesday, Nov 02, 1938; pg. 23; Issue 48141</ref>\n\n====Armaments====\nIn the 1930s, the board of directors authorised expenditure on bringing their arms-making equipment back to use \u2013 it had been stored at company expense since the end of the Great War in the belief that BSA might again be called upon to perform its patriotic duty. In 1939, BSA acquired the blueprints for a [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|submachine gun]] designed by Hungarian arms designer [[P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly]] as well as the rights to manufacture it. Examples were produced in [[9mm Mauser Export]] calibre according to Kiraly's design. It was estimated that these arms would only cost 5 pounds each to manufacture. However, at the time, submachine guns were viewed as \"gangster weapons\" and plans to manufacture it were shelved.<ref>Clark, D.M.

The [[Royal Ordnance Factory|Royal Ordnance Factories]] did not begin production until 1941.  BSA Guns Ltd was also producing [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.303 Browning machine gun]]s for the [[Air Ministry]] at the rate of 600 guns per week in March 1939 and Browning production was to peak at 16,390 per month by March 1942.  The armed forces had chosen the 500 cc side-valve [[BSA M20]] motorcycle as their preferred machine. On the outbreak of war the Government requisitioned the 690 machines BSA had in stock as well as placing an order for another 8,000 machines. South Africa, Ireland, India, Sweden and the Netherlands also wanted machines.\n\nThe Government passed the [[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939]] on 24 August allowing the drafting of defence regulations affecting food, travel, requisitioning of land and supplies, manpower and agricultural production. A second Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was passed on 22 May 1940 allowing the conscription of labour. The fall of France had not been anticipated in Government planning and the encirclement of a large part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] into the Dunkirk pocket resulted in a hasty [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]] of that part of the B.E.F following the abandonment of their equipment. The parlous state of affairs \"no arms, no transport, no equipment\" in the face of the threat of imminent invasion of Britain by  [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] forces was recorded by the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] Field Marshal Sir [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke]] in his diary entries of the 1/2 July 1940.<ref>''War Diaries 1939 -1945'' Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, London 2001, {{ISBN|0-297-60731-6}}</ref>\n[[File:BSA G14 with sidecar and machine gun.JPG|thumb|G14 with sidecar and Lewis gun]]\nThe creation of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following [[Anthony Eden]]'s broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force. BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, had to step up to the mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a seven-day week.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''BSA Centenary 1861 - 1961, BSA Group News, No.17 June 1961'', The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN</ref> Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men in all parts of the UK.\n\nThe BSA factory at Small Heath was [[The Blitz|bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] on 26 August 1940 resulting in one high explosive bomb and a shower of incendiaries hitting the main barrel mill which was the only one operating on service rifles in the country, causing the unaffordable loss of 750 [[machine tool]]s but fortunately no loss of life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''BSA Centenary 1861 - 1961, BSA Group News, No. 17 June 1961'', The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN</ref>  Two further [[Birmingham Blitz|air raids]] took place on 19 and 22 November 1940.<ref name=\"Godwin\">Godwin, Tommy ''It wasn't that easy - The Tommy Godwin story'', John Pinkerton Memorial Publishing Fund, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-9552115-5-3}}</ref>  The air raid of 19 November did the most damage, causing loss of production and trapping hundreds of workers.  Two BSA night-shift electricians, Alf Stevens and Alf Goodwin, helped rescue their fellow workers.  Alf Stevens was awarded the [[George Medal]] for his selfless acts of bravery in the rescue and Alf Goodwin was awarded the [[British Empire Medal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Workers involved in the works [[Air Raid Precautions|Civil Defence]] were brought in to help search for and clear bodies to get the plant back into production.  The net effect of the November raids was to destroy machine shops in the four-storey 1915 building, the original 1863 gunsmiths' building and nearby buildings, 1,600 machine tools, kill 53 employees, injure 89, 30 of them seriously and halt rifle production for three months.\n[[File:IWM-E-16827-light-tank-AA-MkI-19420915.jpg|thumb|Four Besa machine guns]]\nThe Government [[Ministry of Supply]] and BSA immediately began a process of production dispersal throughout Britain, through the [[British shadow factories|shadow factory]] scheme. Factories were set up at [[Tipton]], [[Dudley]], [[Smethwick]], [[Blackheath, West Midlands|Blackheath]], [[Lye, West Midlands|Lye]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]], [[Tyseley]], and [[Bromsgrove]] to manufacture Browning machine guns, [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke]], [[Corsham]], and [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] produced the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano cannon]], [[Leicester]] and [[Redditch|Studley Road]] produced the [[Besa machine gun]], [[Ruislip]] produced the [[Oerlikon 20mm cannon]], [[Stafford]] produced [[RP-3|rocket projectiles]], [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] produced [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|two-pounder gun carriages]], [[Mansfield]] produced the [[Boys anti-tank rifle|Boys Anti-tank gun]] and [[Solihull|Shirley]] produced rifles. These were  dispersal factories which were in addition to Small Heath and the other BSA factories opened in the two years following the 1940 blitz. At its peak Small Heath was running 67 factories engaged in war production. BSA operations were also dispersed to other companies under licence.\n[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1983S03719(2).jpg|thumb|Parachute bicycle]]\nIn 1941 BSA was approached to produce a new pedal cycle with a maximum weight allowance of only 22&nbsp;lb especially for [[Airborne forces|airborne]] use.  This required a new concept in frame design which BSA found, producing a machine which weighed 21&nbsp;lb, one pound less than the design specification and which also exceeded the design requirement for an effective life of 50 miles many times over. Over 60,000 [[folding bicycle]]s were produced, a figure equal to half the total production of military bicycles during World War II. BSA also produced [[Welbike|folding motorcycles]] for the Airborne Division. In late 1942 BSA examined the [[Special Operations Executive]] designed [[BSA Welgun|Welgun]] with a view to manufacture. BSA were willing to manufacture the gun in the quantities required starting April 1943 but the cheaper and less accurate Sten Mk IV was adopted for production by the Ministry of Supply.<ref>Boyce, Frederick and Everett, Douglas, ''S.O.E.- The Scientific Secrets'' Stroud, Gloucester, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7509-3165-5}}</ref>  BSA bought the [[Sunbeam Cycles|Sunbeam]] motorcycles and bicycle business from [[Associated Motor Cycles|Associated Motor Cycles Ltd]] in 1943 and then [[Ariel Motorcycles|Ariel Motors Ltd]] in 1944. During the course of the conflict BSA produced 1,250,000 Lee\u2013Enfield .303 service rifles, 404,383 [[Sten]] sub-machine guns, 468,098 Browning machine guns plus spares equivalent to another 100,000, 42,532 Hispano cannon, 32,971 Oerlikon cannon, 59,322 7.9&nbsp;mm Besa machine guns, 3,218 15&nbsp;mm Besa machine guns, 68,882 Boys Anti-tank guns, 126,334 motorcycles,  128,000 military bicycles (over 60,000 of which were folding paratrooper bicycles), 10,000,000 shell fuse cases, 3,485,335 magazines and 750,000 anti-aircraft rockets were supplied to the armed forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAt the same time other parts of the Group were having similar problems. Before World War II Daimler had been linked with other Coventry motor manufacturers in a government-backed scheme for aero engine manufacture and had been allocated two shadow factories. Apart from this, BSA-owned Daimler was producing [[Daimler Dingo|Scout Cars]] and Daimler Mk I Armoured Cars which had been designed by BSA at Small Heath not Coventry as well as gun turrets, gun parts, tank transmissions, rocket projectiles and other munitions. This activity had not gone unnoticed by the enemy, which made Radford Works a target in the [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry air raids]]. Radford Works received direct hits in four separate air raids during 1940. None of these attacks were to seriously disrupt production, however two more serious air raids were carried out in April 1941 which destroyed half the factory. In all it is estimated that 170 bombs containing 52,000&nbsp;lbs of explosive were dropped on Radford Works as well as the thousands of incendiaries. Like BSA, Daimler had to find dispersal units.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> A back-handed compliment was paid by Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] to the workers at Radford Works when he used a captured Daimler Scout to escape following his defeat at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]].\n\n===Post-war===\n====BSA cycles====\nBSA produced the first Sunbeam bicycle catalogue in 1949 and produced its own '4 Star' [[derailleur gear]] with an associated [[Freehub|splined cassette hub]] and 4 sprocket cassette.<ref>BSA Cycles Ltd, 1951 ''Bicycle Replacement Parts, BSA, Sunbeam, New Hudson'' Birmingham Small Arms Company Ltd, no ISBN</ref>  This design was different from the 1930s Bayliss Wiley cassette hub which had a threaded sprocket carrier.  BSA bought New Hudson motorcycle and bicycle business in 1950 and followed this up in 1951 with the purchase of  [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph Motorcycles]] which brought [[Jack Sangster]] onto the BSA board. The effect of this acquisition was to make BSA into the largest producer of  motorcycles in the world at that time.\n\n1952 saw BSA establish a Professional Cycling Team. [[Bob Maitland]] a successful amateur cyclist and the highest placed British finisher in the 1948 Olympic Games road race and now an independent  rider in the BSA team was a BSA employee working in the design office as a draughtsman. It was Bob Maitland who was responsible for the design of post war BSA range of lightweight sports bicycles based on his knowledge of cycling.<ref name=\"Godwin\" />  Bob Maitland also made some of the components used on the bicycles of the professional team which were not standard production machines. In the 1952 [[Tour of Britain]] Road Race run between Friday 22 August and Saturday 6 September, involving 14 individual stages and covering a total race distance of  1,470 miles, the BSA team of Bob Maitland, \u201cTiny\u201d Thomas, Pete Proctor, Alf Newman and Stan Jones won the overall team race and Pete Proctor \u201cKing of the Mountains\u201d classification. The riders also enjoyed success on the individual stages of the race. The team competed in four further events, 14 September Tour of the Chilterns, 1st \u201cTiny\u201d Thomas and Team Prize, 21 September Weston-Super-Mare Grand Prix, Team Prize, 28 September Staffordshire Grand Prix, 1st Bob Maitland and Team Prize, 5 October Tour Revenge Race, Dublin, 1st \u201cTiny\u201d Thomas and Team prize.<ref>BSA Cycles Ltd, ''The Story of How BSA Won The \u201cDaily Express\u201d TOUR OF BRITAIN TEAM PRIZE and \u201cThe King of the Mountains\u201d'', Birmingham Small Arms (1952), no ISBN</ref>\n\nIn 1953 BSA withdrew motorcycle production from BSA Cycles Ltd, the company it has established in 1919,  by creating BSA Motorcycles Ltd.\n\nIn 1953 the BSA Professional Cycling Team was managed by [[Syd Cozens]].  Successes were 5/6 April Bournemouth Two Day Road Race, 1st Bob Maitland, 12 April Dover to London 63 Miles Road Race, 1st Stan Jones,  31 May Langsett 90 Miles Road Race, 1st Bob Maitland and \u201cKing of the Mountains\u201d,  7 June Tour of the Wrekin, 1st Bob Maitland,  12 July Severn Valley 100 Miles Road Race, 1st \u201cTiny\u201d Thomas, 19 July Jackson Trophy, Newcastle, Team Prize, 9 August Les Adams Memorial 80 Miles Road Race, 1st Alf Newman, Team Prize, \u201cKing of the Mountains\u201d Arthur Ilsley,  30 August Weston-Super-Mare 100 Miles Grand Prix, 1st Bob Maitland, Team Prize.  The team also competed in the 1,624 mile, 12 stage,  1953 Tour of Britain Road Race.  The 1953 line up had changed as Arthur Ilsley replaced Pete Proctor in the team. \u201cTiny\u201d Thomas won the overall individual classification, the Team were runners-up in the team competition and Arthur Ilsley was 3rd in the \u201cKing of the Mountains\u201d competition.  Bob Maitland also had notable success by winning the Independent National Championship.<ref>BSA Cycles Ltd, ''1st BSA Wins \u201cDaily Express\u201d Tour of Britain'', Birmingham Small Arms, (November 1953), no ISBN</ref>\n\n1954 saw the introduction of  the BSA Quick Release 3 Speed hub gear.  It was a split axle three speed gear intended for use with bicycles equipped with oil bath chainguards.  The original BSA 3 speed hub gear had been made under licence from the Three-Speed Gear Syndicate since 1907.  The design was later to be classified as the [[Sturmey-Archer]] 'Type X', but all BSA hub gear production ceased in 1955<ref>Hadland, Tony ''The Sturmey-Archer Story'', privately published, (1987), {{ISBN|0-9507431-2-7}}</ref>\n[[File:1955 Daimler DK 400 'Golden Zebra' Coup\u00e9 p1.JPG|thumb|Lady Docker's 1955 Golden Zebra<br>Daimler coup\u00e9]]\n\n====Management====\nSir [[Bernard Docker]] remained chairman of BSA until 1956 when the BSA removed him.  In an acrimonious dispute conducted in the media the matter was brought to the BSA shareholders at the Annual General Meeting where the decision of the Board was upheld. Another significant departure for the fortune of the BSA Group but less controversial was the retirement on ill health grounds of James Leek CBE, Managing Director from 1939 until his retirement. Sir Bernard Docker was replaced as Chairman of the BSA Board by Jack Sangster.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/>\n\n==Dispersals==\nThe BSA bicycle division, BSA Cycles Ltd., including the BSA cycle dealer network was sold to [[Raleigh (bicycle)|Raleigh]] in 1957.<ref name=\"Bowden Gregory Houston 1975\">Bowden, Gregory Houston (1975). ''The Story of the Raleigh Cycle''. London: Allen. {{ISBN|0-491-01675-1}}</ref>  Raleigh initially continued bicycle production in Birmingham at Coventry Road, Sheldon, Birmingham 26 into the early 1960s using up BSA parts but as time went on more stock Raleigh parts and fittings were used, some continuing to bear the 'piled arms' stamp. [[Tube Investments|TI Group]] owners of the [[British Cycle Corporation]] bought Raleigh in 1960 thus gaining access to the BSA brand.  Bicycles bearing the BSA name are currently manufactured and distributed within India by [[TI Cycles of India]] but have no direct connection to the original Birmingham BSA company.\n\nIn 1960, [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] was sold to [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]].\n\n1961 was the centenary year of the BSA Group and in recognition of this milestone the company magazine produced an anniversary issue of ''BSA Group News'' in June  ''BSA Centenary 1861\u20131961'' in which many of the achievements of the Group were celebrated. This year also saw the end of military rifle production, however BSA still continued to make sporting guns.\n\n==Products==\n\n===Bicycles===\nAccording to Charles Spencer, BSA was manufacturing the \"Delta\" bicycle circa 1869. In 1880 the company was approached to manufacture the \"Otto Dicycle\". An initial contract was signed to produce 210 and a further contract followed for a further 200.  In all it is believed that a total of 953 Otto machines were made. BSA then went into bicycle production on their own account, the first machines to their own specification being exhibited at the 1881 [[Stanley Cycle Show|Stanley Show]]. BSA went on to design and manufacture a \"safety\" bicycle (patent:15,342 of 1884). BSA was also producing tricycles and a licence was obtained in 1885 to manufacture ball bearings. BSA ceased bicycle manufacture in 1887 because of the demand for arms. Bicycle component manufacture commenced in 1894 and BSA continued to supply the bicycle trade up to 1936. The company recommenced bicycle manufacture on their own account again in 1908 and these were exhibited at the Stanley Show in 1909.<ref>Millar, Ray (2009).

BSA supplied the Irish Army with bicycles after 1922.\n\nBSA manufactured a range of bicycles from utility roadsters through to racing bicycles. The BSA range of Sports bicycles expanded in the 1930s following the granting of a patent for a new lighter design of seat lug in 1929<ref>Intellectual Property Office, (patent application date 4 July 1929), ''GB332384(A) Improvements in or relating to the construction of cycle frames'' BSA Birmingham, no ISBN</ref> and tandems were introduced into the BSA bicycle range as well. BSA had a reputation for quality and durability and their components were more expensive that either Chater-Lea or Brampton.  BSA launched a high end club cyclists machine in the early 1930s initially branded as the \"Super-eeze\". Never slow to avail of publicity BSA sponsored the great Australian cyclist [[Hubert Opperman]] <ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3415216471/in/set-72157603949012058/]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> and re-branded the top of the range machine the \"Opperman\" model.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/2777313275/in/set-72157606633777810/false=no]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref><ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/2777318159/in/set-72157606633777810/deadlink=no]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>  A less expensive range of clubman lightweight machines was introduced from 1936 with the \"Cyclo\" 3 speed derailleur equipped \"Clubman\".

This all stopped around September 1939 with the outbreak of war. A revised catalogue with a much reduced range was issued in March 1940 which also saw the launch of the BSA \"Streamlight\" model.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3041830262/in/set-72157606633777810/]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>  A novel all white bicycle <ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3040988703/in/set-72157606633777810/]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> was produced for the blackout but had disappeared from a severely reduced bicycle range the details of which were circulated to dealers from December 1941. BSA had ceased production of their 3 speed hub gear in 1939 and production appears to have started again by 1945 although with a black finish instead of chromium plating.  BSA bought '''Sunbeam''' in 1943 and produced Sunbeam bicycles using up existing frames and parts and using BSA components for the missing bits.  The first BSA produced Sunbeam catalogue was published in 1949<ref>Pinkerton, John; Roberts, Derek; Hadland, Tony; and Lawrence, Scotford (2002).

Birmingham: Pinkerton Press. {{ISBN|0-9536174-3-2}}</ref>\n\nPost war BSA expanded their bicycle range but faced problems of shortages of raw materials such as steel and was required to export a lot of their manufactured output in order to get a Government licence to purchase the necessary raw materials.  The company moved bicycle production to the new Waverley Works after World War II.  BSA continued to innovate introducing the 4 Star derailleur gear in 1949<ref name=BertoDancingChain2ndEd>\n{{cite book\n |pages=168\n |author=Berto, Frank J.\n |author2=Ron Shepherd \n |display-authors=etal\n |title=The Dancing Chain: History and  Development of the Derailleur Bicycle\n |edition=2nd\n |year=2005\n |origyear=2000\n |isbn=1-89249-541-4\n |url=http://www.thedancingchain.com/\n |publisher=Cycle Publishing/Van der Plas Publications\n |location = [[San Francisco, CA]], USA\n |accessdate=May 30, 2017\n}}</ref><ref name=BertoDancingChain5thEd>\n{{cite book\n |author=Berto, Frank J.\n |display-authors=etal\n |title=The Dancing Chain: History and  Development of the Derailleur Bicycle\n |edition=5th\n |year=2016\n |origyear=2000\n |ISBN=978-1-892495-77-8\n |url=http://www.cyclepublishing.com/cyclingbooks/\n |publisher=Cycle Publishing/Van der Plas Publications\n |location = [[San Francisco, CA]], USA\n |accessdate=May 30, 2017\n}}</ref> along with an associated 4-speed 'unit' or cassette hub.

BSA bought New Hudson in 1950<ref>BSA Cycles Ltd, April 1950 ''Letter to Dealers reference newspaper advertising campaign for New Hudson bicycles to be run in local newspapers from March to August 1950'', Birmingham, no ISBN</ref>  and started to manufacture and sell New Hudson branded machines as well as Sunbeam. It appears that the top of the range BSA lightweight club cyclist machine was the \"Gold Column\" and this appears to have been changed into the BSA \"Tour of Britain\" model following the success of the BSA Professional Cycling Team in the 1952 Tour of Britain race.  The \"Tour of Britain\" model was heavily promoted in the BSA 1953 sales literature. The factory made \"Tour of Britain\" model was not the same as those ridden by the professional team.  Only eight machines were crafted for the professional team and none of the components appear to have been standard BSA parts. 1953 saw BSA separate the bicycle / motorcar and motorcycle business into different holdings.\n\nThe good times were coming to an end and demand for bicycles fell with the end of rationing in 1954.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_3818000/3818563.stm BBC ON THIS DAY | 4 | 1954: Housewives celebrate end of rationing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Failed verification|reason=Doesn't mention bicycles|date=March 2018}} James Leek, managing director of BSA Cycles Ltd was suffering ill health and he retired in 1956, the same year  the BSA Chairman, Sir Bernard Docker,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862195-1,00.html Time magazine 11 June 1956]</ref> was removed from the BSA Board.

The task of providing all this beef went to a [[Scotsman]] living in Canada named [[John Lawson Johnston]]. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its transport and storage were problematic. Therefore, Johnston created a product known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef', later called Bovril, to meet the needs of Napoleon III.<ref name=\"uni\">{{cite web | title=Bovril| url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands-in-action/detail/Bovril/293591/| work=Unilever.co.uk| accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> By 1888, over 3,000 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] [[public house]]s, grocers and [[dispensing chemist]]s were selling Bovril.

The values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the adjacent table. For every even {{math|''n''}} other than 0, {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is negative if {{math|''n''}} is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. For every odd {{math|''n''}} other than 1, {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe superscript \u00b1 used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} term is affected: \n*{{math|''B''{{su|p=\u2212|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=\u2212|b=1}} = \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is the sign convention prescribed by [[NIST]] and most modern textbooks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=278 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}</ref>\n* {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is sometimes used in the older literature.<ref name=\"MW1\">{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation <math>B_n^{+{}}=(-1)^n B_n^{-{}}</math>.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are special values of the [[Bernoulli polynomial]]s <math>B_n(x)</math>, with <math>B^{-{}}_n=B_n(0)</math> and <math>B^+_n=B_n(1)</math>.<ref name=\"MW1\"/>\n\nSince {{math|1=''B''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}} for all odd {{math|''n'' > 1}}, and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write \"{{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}}\" to mean {{math|''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>}}.  This article does not follow this notation.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[tangent function|tangent]] and [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic tangent]] functions, in [[Faulhaber's formula]] for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]], and in expressions for certain values of the [[Riemann zeta function]].\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician [[Jacob Bernoulli]], after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician [[Takakazu Seki|Seki K\u014dwa]].  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712<ref name=\"selin 1997\">Selin, H. (1997), p. 891</ref><ref name=\"smith mikami 1914\">Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108</ref>  in his work ''Katsuyo Sampo''; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' of 1713.  [[Ada Lovelace]]'s [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|note G]] on the [[Analytical Engine]] from 1842 describes an [[algorithm]] for generating Bernoulli numbers with [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s machine.<ref>''Note G'' in the Menabrea reference</ref> As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex [[computer program]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.\n\n[[File:Seki Kowa Katsuyo Sampo Bernoulli numbers.png|thumb|right|A page from Seki Takakazu's ''Katsuyo Sampo'' (1712), tabulating binomial coefficients and Bernoulli numbers]]\n\nMethods to calculate the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity to consider this problem were [[Pythagoras]] (c. 572\u2013497&nbsp;BCE, Greece), [[Archimedes]] (287\u2013212&nbsp;BCE, Italy), [[Aryabhata]] (b. 476, India), [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]] (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn [[al-Haytham]] (965\u20131039, Iraq).\n\nDuring the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West [[Thomas Harriot]] (1560\u20131621) of England, [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580\u20131635) of Germany, [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601\u20131665) and fellow French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623\u20131662) all played important roles.\n\nThomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 ''Academia Algebrae'', far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.\n\nBlaise Pascal in 1654 proved [[Faulhaber's formula|''Pascal's identity'']] relating the sums of the {{math|''p''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, \u2026, ''k''}}.\n\nThe Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654\u20131705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants {{math|''B''<sub>0</sub>, ''B''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>2</sub>,\u2026}} which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers {{harv|Knuth|1993}}.\n\nThe joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the {{mvar|c}}th powers for any positive integer {{math|''c''}} can be seen from his comment. He wrote:\n\n:\"With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500.\"\n\nBernoulli's result was published posthumously in ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' in 1713.  [[Seki K\u014dwa]] independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.<ref name=\"selin 1997\"/>  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.\n\nBernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of [[Abraham de Moivre]].\n\nBernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth {{harv|Knuth|1993}} a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] in 1834 {{harv|Jacobi|1834}}. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes (the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on):\n\n:''\"Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants'' {{math|''B''<sub>0</sub>, ''B''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>2</sub>,}} ''\u2026 would provide a uniform''\n\n:: <math> \\quad \\sum n^m = \\frac 1{m+1}\\left( B_0n^{m+1}+\\binom{m+1} 1 B^+_1 n^m+\\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}+\\cdots+\\binom{m+1}mB_mn\\right) </math>\n::or\n:: <math> \\quad \\sum n^m = \\frac 1{m+1}\\left( B_0n^{m+1}-\\binom{m+1} 1 B^{-{}}_1 n^m+\\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}-\\cdots +(-1)^m\\binom{m+1}mB_mn\\right) </math>\n:''for all sums of powers. He never mentioned, for example, the fact that almost half of the coefficients turned out to be zero after he had converted his formulas for'' {{math|\u2211 ''n<sup>m</sup>''}} ''from polynomials in {{mvar|N}} to polynomials in {{mvar|n}}.\"  {{harv|Knuth|1993|p=14}}''\n\n=== Reconstruction of \"Summae Potestatum\" ===\n\n[[File:JakobBernoulliSummaePotestatum.png|thumb|right|upright=2.5|Jakob Bernoulli's \"Summae Potestatum\", 1713]]\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}(n)/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''B''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''B'' {{=}} ''B''<sub>4</sub>}}, {{math|''C'' {{=}} ''B''<sub>6</sub>}}, {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''B''<sub>8</sub>}}. The expression {{math|''c''\u00b7''c''\u22121\u00b7''c''\u22122\u00b7''c''\u22123}} means {{math|''c''\u00b7(''c''\u22121)\u00b7(''c''\u22122)\u00b7(''c''\u22123)}} \u2013 the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial powers]] {{math|''c''<sup>{{underline|''k''}}</sup>}}. The factorial notation {{math|''k''!}} as a shortcut for {{math|1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 ''k''}} was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 who used it as a long letter {{math|''S''}} for \"summa\" (sum). (The ''Mathematics Genealogy Project''<ref>[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]</ref>\nshows Leibniz as the academic<!--not doctoral--> advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the ''Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus''.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]</ref>) The letter {{math|''n''}} on the left hand side is not an index of [[summation]] but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as {{math|1, 2, \u2026, ''n''}}. Putting things together, for positive {{math|''c''}}, today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:\n\n: <math> \\sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \\frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\\frac 1 2 n^c+\\sum_{k=2}^c \\frac{B_k}{k!} c^{\\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.</math>\n\nThis formula suggests setting {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6\u2026 to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the [[falling factorial]] {{math|''c''<sup>{{underline|''k''\u22121}}</sup>}} has for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} the value {{math|{{sfrac|1|''c'' + 1}}}}.<ref>{{Citation\n  | author = [[Ronald Graham|Graham, R.]] |author2=[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, D.

It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of) {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}} arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed {{harv|Buhler|Crandall|Ernvall|Metsankyla|2001}} which require only {{math|''O''(''p'' (log ''p'')<sup>2</sup>)}} operations (see [[big-O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]).\n\nDavid Harvey {{harv|Harvey|2008}} describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} modulo {{mvar|p}} for many small primes {{mvar|p}}, and then reconstructing {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} via the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. Harvey writes that the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of this algorithm is {{math|''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup> log(''n'')<sup>2 + ''\u03b5''</sup>)}} and claims that this [[implementation]] is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10<sup>8</sup>}}. Harvey's implementation has been included in [[SageMath]] since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner {{harv|Kellner|2002}}<!--A more specific citation would be preferable.--> computed {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} to full precision for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10<sup>6</sup>}} in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk {{harv|Pavlyk|2008}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10<sup>7</sup>}} with [[Mathematica]] in April 2008.\n\n:{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n!

S. C. Woon {{harv|Woon|1997}} described an algorithm to compute {{math|''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub>(1)}} as a binary tree:\n\n:[[File:SCWoonTree.png]]\n\nWoon's recursive algorithm (for {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}}) starts by assigning to the root node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [1,2]}}. Given a node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>]}} of the tree, the left child of the node is {{math|''L''(''N'') {{=}} [\u2212''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub> + 1, ''a''<sub>3</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>]}} and the right child {{math|''R''(''N'') {{=}} [''a''<sub>1</sub>, 2, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>]}}. A node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>]}} is written as {{math|\u00b1[''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>]}} in the initial part of the tree represented above with \u00b1 denoting the sign of {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>}}.\n\nGiven a node {{mvar|N}} the factorial of {{mvar|N}} is defined as\n\n:<math> N! = a_1 \\prod_{k=2}^{\\operatorname{length}(N)} a_k!. </math>\n\nRestricted to the nodes {{mvar|N}} of a fixed tree-level {{mvar|n}} the sum of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''N''!}}}} is {{math|''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub>(1)}}, thus\n\n:<math> B_n = \\sum_\\stackrel{N \\text{ node of}}{\\text{ tree-level } n} \\frac{n!}{N!}. </math>\n\nFor example:\n:{{math|1=''B''<sub>1</sub> = 1!({{sfrac|1|2!}})}}\n:{{math|1=''B''<sub>2</sub> = 2!(\u2212{{sfrac|1|3!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!}})}}\n:{{math|1=''B''<sub>3</sub> = 3!({{sfrac|1|4!}} \u2212 {{sfrac|1|2!3!}} \u2212 {{sfrac|1|3!2!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!2!}})}}\n\n==Integral representation and continuation==\n\nThe [[integral]]\n: <math> b(s) = 2e^{s i \\pi/2}\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{st^s}{1-e^{2\\pi t}} \\frac{dt}{t} </math>\nhas as special values {{math|''b''(2''n'') {{=}} ''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=''b''(3) = {{sfrac|3|2}}''\u03b6''(3)''&pi;''<sup>\u22123</sup>''i''}} and {{math|1=''b''(5) = \u2212{{sfrac|15|2}}''\u03b6''(5)''&pi;''<sup>\u22125</sup>''i''}}. Here, {{mvar|\u03b6}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]]. Leonhard Euler (''Opera Omnia'', Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p.&nbsp;351) considered these numbers and calculated\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n  p &=  \\frac{3}{2\\pi^3}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{3^3}+\\cdots \\right) = 0.0581522\\ldots \\\\\n  q &= \\frac{15}{2\\pi^5}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2^5}+\\frac{1}{3^5}+\\cdots \\right) = 0.0254132\\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==The relation to the Euler numbers and {{pi}}==\n\nThe [[Euler number]]s are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the\nasymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers {{math|''E''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} are in magnitude approximately {{math|{{sfrac|2|\u03c0}}(4<sup>2''n''</sup> \u2212 2<sup>2''n''</sup>)}} times larger than the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>}}. In consequence:\n\n: <math> \\pi \\sim 2 (2^{2n} - 4^{2n}) \\frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. </math>\n\nThis asymptotic equation reveals that {{pi}} lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact {{pi}} could be computed from these rational approximations.\n\nBernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd {{mvar|n}}, {{math|''B''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} ''E''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} 0}} (with the exception {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub>}}), it suffices to consider the case when {{mvar|n}} is even.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n B_{n} &= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\binom{n-1}{k} \\frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k & n&=2, 4, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n E_{n} &= \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n}{k-1} \\frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k & n&=2,4,6,\\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese conversion formulas express an [[inverse relation]] between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to {{pi}}. These numbers are defined for {{math|''n'' > 1}} as\n\n:<math> S_n = 2 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^n \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^\\infty (4k+1)^{-n} \\qquad k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\\ldots </math>\n\nand {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}} by convention {{harv|Elkies|2003}}. The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in a landmark paper {{harv|Euler|1735}} ''\u2018De summis serierum reciprocarum\u2019'' (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are\n\n: <math> S_n = 1,1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{5}{24}, \\frac{2}{15},\\frac{61}{720},\\frac{17}{315},\\frac{277}{8064},\\frac{62}{2835},\\ldots  </math> ({{OEIS2C|id=A099612}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A099617}})\n\nThese are the coefficients in the expansion of {{math|sec ''x'' + tan ''x''}}.\n\nThe Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as ''special views'' of these numbers, selected from the sequence {{math|''S''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and scaled for use in special applications.\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  B_{n} &= (-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [ n \\text{ even}] \\frac{n! }{2^n - 4^n}\\, S_{n}\\ , & n&= 2, 3, \\ldots \\\\\n  E_n &= (-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [ n \\text{ even}] n! \\, S_{n+1}  & n &= 0, 1, \\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe expression [{{math|''n''}} even] has the value 1 if {{math|''n''}} is even and 0 otherwise ([[Iverson bracket]]).\n\nThese identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|2''S''<sub>''n''</sub>|''S''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}}}} when {{mvar|n}} is even. The {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are rational approximations to {{pi}} and two successive terms always enclose the true value of {{pi}}. Beginning with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the sequence starts ({{OEIS2C|id=A132049}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A132050}}):\n\n: <math> 2, 4, 3, \\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{25}{8}, \\frac{192}{61}, \\frac{427}{136}, \\frac{4352}{1385}, \\frac{12465}{3968}, \\frac{158720}{50521},\\ldots \\quad \\longrightarrow \\pi. </math>\n\nThese rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above.\n\nConsider the Akiyama\u2013Tanigawa transform for the sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A046978}} ({{math|''n'' + 2}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A016116}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! 0 \n|1||{{sfrac|1|2}}||0||\u2212{{sfrac|1|4}}||\u2212{{sfrac|1|4}}||\u2212{{sfrac|1|8}}||0\n|-\n! 1 \n| {{sfrac|1|2}}|| 1|| {{sfrac|3|4}}|| 0|| \u2212{{sfrac|5|8}}|| \u2212{{sfrac|3|4}}||\n|-\n! 2 \n| \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}|| {{sfrac|1|2}}|| {{sfrac|9|4}}|| {{sfrac|5|2}}|| {{sfrac|5|8}}|| ||\n|-\n! 3 \n| \u22121|| \u2212{{sfrac|7|2}}|| \u2212{{sfrac|3|4}}|| {{sfrac|15|2}}|| || ||\n|-\n! 4 \n| {{sfrac|5|2}}|| \u2212{{sfrac|11|2}}|| \u2212{{sfrac|99|4}}|| || || ||\n|-\n! 5 \n| 8|| {{sfrac|77|2}}|| || || || ||\n|-\n! 6 \n| \u2212{{sfrac|61|2}}|| || || || || ||\n|}\n\nFrom the second, the numerators of the first column are the denominators of Euler's formula. The first column is \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}} \u00d7 {{OEIS2C|id=A163982}}.\n\n==An algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle==\n\nThe sequence ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> divide the factorial (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<nowiki>!</nowiki>. In other words: the numbers ''T''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''S''<sub>''n''</sub>(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!, sometimes called [[Alternating permutations|Euler zigzag numbers]], are integers.\n\n: <math> T_n = 1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,2,\\,5,\\,16,\\,61,\\,272,\\,1385,\\,7936,\\,50521,\\,353792,\\ldots \\quad n=0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots </math> ({{OEIS2C|id=A000111}}). See ({{OEIS2C|id=A253671}}).\n\nThus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n B_n &= (-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [n\\text{ even}] \\frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\\, T_{n-1}\\  & n &= 2, 3, \\ldots \\\\\n E_n &= (-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor} [n\\text{ even}] T_{n+1} & n &= 0, 1, \\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers {{math|''E''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are given immediately by {{math|''T''<sub>2''n'' + 1</sub>}} and the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} are obtained from {{math|''T''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.\n\nWhat remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers {{math|''T''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. However, already in 1877 [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]] {{harv|Seidel|1877}} published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate {{math|''T''<sub>''n''</sub>}}.\n\n:[[File:SeidelAlgorithmForTn.png|frame|none|Seidel's algorithm for {{math|''T''<sub>''n''</sub>}}]]\n\n#Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let {{math|''k''}} denote the number of the row currently being filled\n#If {{math|''k''}} is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row {{math|''k'' \u2212 1}} in the first position of the row {{math|''k''}}, and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper\n#At the end of the row duplicate the last number.\n#If {{math|''k''}} is even, proceed similar in the other direction.\n\nSeidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont {{harv|Dumont|1981}}) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.\n\nSimilar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz {{harv|Knuth|Buckholtz|1967}} gave a recurrence equation for the numbers {{math|''T''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} and recommended this method for computing {{math|''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} and {{math|''E''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} \u2018on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers\u2019.\n\nV.

The sum extends over all [[prime number|primes]] {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' \u2212 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}.\n\nA consequence of this is that the denominator of {{math|''B''<sub>2''n''</sub>}} is given by the product of all primes {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' \u2212 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}. In particular, these denominators are [[square-free]] and divisible by&nbsp;6.\n\n=== Why do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? ===\nThe sum\n\n:<math>\\varphi_k(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^n i^k - \\frac{n^k} 2</math>\n\ncan be evaluated for negative values of the index {{math|''n''}}. Doing so will show that it is an [[odd function]] for even values of {{math|''k''}}, which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that {{math|''B''<sub>2''k'' + 1 \u2212 ''m''</sub>}} is 0 for {{math|''m''}} even and {{math|2''k'' + 1 \u2212 ''m'' > 1}}; and that the term for {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub>}} is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von Staudt\u2013Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for ''n'' > 1).\n\nFrom the von Staudt\u2013Clausen theorem it is known that for odd {{math|''n'' > 1}} the number {{math|2''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets\n\n: <math> 2B_n =\\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \\frac{2}{m+1}m! \\left\\{{n+1\\atop m+1} \\right\\} = 0\\quad(n>1 \\text{ is odd})</math>\n\nas a ''sum of integers'', which is not trivial. Here a combinatorial fact comes to surface which explains the vanishing of the Bernoulli numbers at odd index. Let {{math|''S''<sub>''n'',''m''</sub>}} be the number of surjective maps from {{math|{1, 2, \u2026, ''n''}|}} to {{math|{1, 2, \u2026, ''m''}|}}, then {{math|''S''<sub>''n'',''m''</sub> {{=}} ''m''!<big><big>{</big></big>{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}<big><big>}</big></big>}}. The last equation can only hold if\n\n: <math> \\sum_{\\text{odd }m=1}^{n-1} \\frac 2 {m^2}S_{n,m}=\\sum_{\\text{even } m=2}^n \\frac{2}{m^2} S_{n,m} \\quad (n>2 \\text{ is even}). </math>\n\nThis equation can be proved by induction. The first two examples of this equation are\n\n:{{math|1=''n'' = 4: 2 + 8 = 7 + 3}},\n:{{math|1=''n'' = 6: 2 + 120 + 144 = 31 + 195 + 40}}.\n\nThus the Bernoulli numbers vanish at odd index because some non-obvious combinatorial identities are embodied in the Bernoulli numbers.\n\n=== A restatement of the Riemann hypothesis ===\n\nThe connection between the Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function is strong enough to provide an alternate formulation of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (RH) which uses only the Bernoulli number. In fact [[Marcel Riesz]] {{harv|Riesz|1916}} proved that the RH is equivalent to the following assertion:\n\n:For every {{math|''\u03b5'' > {{sfrac|1|4}}}} there exists a constant {{math|''C''<sub>''\u03b5''</sub> > 0}} (depending on {{math|''\u03b5''}}) such that {{math|{{abs|''R''(''x'')}} < ''C''<sub>''\u03b5''</sub>''x''<sup>''\u03b5''</sup>}} as {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u221e}}.\n\nHere {{math|''R''(''x'')}} is the [[Riesz function]]\n\n: <math> R(x) = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\n\\frac{k^{\\overline{k}} x^{k}}{(2\\pi)^{2k}\\left(\\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\\right)}\n= 2\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{k^{\\overline{k}}x^k}{(2\\pi)^{2k}\\beta_{2k}}. </math>\n\n{{math|''n''<sup>{{overline|''k''}}</sup>}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] in the notation of [[D. E. Knuth]]. The numbers {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''B''<sub>''n''</sub>|''n''}}}} occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a {{math|''p''}}-integer for primes {{math|''p''}} where {{math|''p'' \u2212 1}} does not divide {{math|''n''}}.  The {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are called ''divided Bernoulli numbers''.\n\n==<span id=\"Generalized Bernoulli numbers\"></span>Generalized Bernoulli numbers==\nThe '''generalized Bernoulli numbers''' are certain [[algebraic number]]s, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to [[Special values of L-functions|special values]] of [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-functions]] in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nLet {{mvar|\u03c7}} be a [[Dirichlet character]] modulo {{mvar|f}}.

Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/> Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form the word EXTEND, he/she earns a bonus life and both players immediately advance to the next level.\n\nA player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn \"angry\"\u2014turning pink in color and moving faster\u2014if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.\n\nIn the 100th and final level, players face a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/><ref name = \"rgamer95\"/><ref name = \"rgamer28\">{{citation | title=The Definitive - Bubble Bobble | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=28 | pages=58\u201368 | date= July 2006 | first = Stuart | last = Campbell | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] }}</ref> This game was one of the first to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: \"Come here with your friend.\" If two players complete the game, they see a \"Happy End,\" in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult \"Super\" mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second \"Happy End\" is displayed in which Super Drunk (the defeated boss) is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence.

The Game Gear port (which emulates the Master System version of ''Bubble Bobble'') was done by South Korean developer Open Corporation. The Commodore 64, Spectrum and Amiga versions were developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] and published in the UK by [[Firebird Software]]. Most of the other computer ports were made by US-based [[Novalogic]] with the exception of the X68000 game in Japan that was done by Dempa Shinbunsha.\n\nCommodore 64 coder Steve Ruddy recalled in [[Retro Gamer]]: {{quote|It wasn't daunting originally, as it looked like a fairly straightforward [[platform game|platform]] and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] game. However, once you start playing you noticed how the bubbles followed air flow patterns and how they all gathered in fixed places - lots of sprites on the same line meant a [[sprite multiplexing|sprite multiplexer]] wasn't suitable. Fortunately, having worked on the [[BBC Micro]] and ''Mystery of the Nile'', I wasn't averse to using software sprites. ... We didn't understand all of the secrets so we just implemented the game to mimic what we did notice. So how the pick-ups appear isn't the same as the arcade on the C64, but it should be very similar to how the pickups appear after the machine is powered up.<ref>{{cite news | last = Bevan | first= Mike | date = December 2013 | title = Bubbles, Baseball and Buzz Saws - Software Creations | journal = Retro Gamer | issue = 122 | pages = 74\u201379 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Master System/Game Gear version is noted for having two hundred levels (in effect the normal and super modes consecutively) and is considered one of the best conversions available.<ref name = \"rgamer28\"/> This version was originally released as ''Final Bubble Bobble'' in 1988 for the Master System in Japan.

It is used to explore the partnership's possession of aces, kings and in some variants, the queen of [[Trump (card games)|trumps]], to judge more precisely whether [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#slam|slam]] is likely to be a good contract.\n\nTwo versions of Blackwood are common: \"standard\" Blackwood, developed by Easley in 1933,<ref>The Bridge Players' Encyclopaedia, International Edition, Paul Hamlyn, London, 1967, p. 37</ref> and \"Roman Key Card\" Blackwood (''RKC'' or ''RKCB''), named for the Italian team which invented it. Standard Blackwood enables one partner to count partnership aces and kings in general. Key card variants are defined by a particular \"key\" suit and enable counting the trump king and queen, as well as aces and kings. Both versions are initiated by a bid of four notrump ([[4NT (bid)|4NT]]), and the entire family of conventions may be called ''Blackwood 4NT'' in both versions, or ''Key Card 4NT'' in the key card variation.\n\nThere are other 4NT conventions, such as [[Culbertson 4-5 Notrump]], [[Norman four notrump|Norman Four Notrump]] and [[San Francisco convention|San Francisco]], but almost all bridge partnerships employ some member of the Blackwood family (which includes [[Byzantine Blackwood convention|Byzantine Blackwood]]) as part of their slam-investigation methods.\n\nIf the partnership's preceding call is a natural bid in notrump, then 4NT is usually played as natural. Over an opposing pass it is simply a raise and a {{gcb|quantitative|quantitative}} invitation to six notrump, a small slam. Over an intervening four of a suit by opponents it is usually played as a competitive raise, expecting to play four notrump. Those natural interpretations may hold in other auctions where the partnership has previously bid notrump naturally or shown a balanced hand conventionally. In some situations where 4NT is a quantitative invitation, especially where 4{{Clubs}} is a jump, many partnerships use the [[Gerber convention]] instead of the Blackwood family: 4{{Clubs}} asks for the number of aces or key cards.\n\nWhere both sides are bidding, 4NT is often played as a conventional takeout asking partner to help choose one of two or three suits, similar to a lower-level takeout double or {{gcb|cuebid|cuebid}} reply to such a double.\n<!-- Perhaps the theme of the last two paragraphs should be covered in a section below: when 4NT is not Blackwood -->\n\n==Standard Blackwood==\nWhere standard Blackwood 4NT is in force, a four notrump bid (4NT) asks partner to disclose the number of aces in his hand. With no aces or four, partner replies 5{{Clubs}}; with one, two, or three aces, 5{{Diams}}, 5{{Hearts}}, or 5{{Spades}}, respectively. The difference between no aces and four is clear to the Blackwood bidder (unless the partnership lacks all four) so one member of the partnership knows the combined number of aces. That is often sufficient to set the final contract. (A common agreement is that when spades is not the trump suit, 5{{spades}} asks responder to bid 5NT. That is useful when the reply to 4NT bypasses the intended trump suit but also shows that slam is likely to be a poor contract because two aces are missing.)\n\nThe continuation bid of 5NT asks for the number of kings according to the same code of replies at the six-level: 6{{Clubs}} shows no kings or four, etc. Asking for the number of kings confirms that the partnership holds all four aces, so partner may reply at the seven level with expectation of taking thirteen tricks.\n\nA void may be as good as an ace in some situations but it should not be counted as an ace. Some experts (Kantar for one<ref>Kantar (2008), page 44.</ref>) recommend the 5NT reply to 4NT &ndash; the cheapest with no standard assigned meaning &ndash; to show a void plus two aces and six of a suit to show a void in the bid suit plus one ace.\n\n== Roman Blackwood ==\nA variation of the standard Blackwood convention, known as ''Roman Blackwood'', was popularized by the famous Italian [[Blue Team (bridge)|Blue Team]] in the 1960s. In Roman Blackwood, the responses are even more ambiguous, but more space-conserving. The basic outline of responses is:\n{|\n|5{{Clubs}}||\u2013 0 or 3 aces\n|-\n|5{{Diams}}||\u2013 1 or 4 aces\n|-\n|5{{Hearts}}||\u2013 2 aces\n|}\nIn practice, the ambiguity is unlikely to occur, as a strength difference between hands with 0 or 1 and 3 or 4 aces is big enough that it can be established in previous rounds of bidding. In other words, a partner who has previously shown, for example, 12-15 range of [[High card point|high points]] is unlikely to hold 3 aces for his bid, etc.\n\nEven Roman Blackwood convention has several variations, revolving around 5{{Hearts}} and 5{{Spades}} responses. In all variants, they denote 2 aces. One variation is that 5{{Spades}} shows extra values, while 5{{Hearts}} does not. In other variations, responses 5{{Hearts}} - 5NT denote specific combinations of aces (same color, same rank, or \"mixed\").\n\nIf the querying partner ascertains that all aces are present, he can continue as follows:\n*5NT is the [[Grand slam force]]\n*The first available bid which is not the agreed suit is the Roman Blackwood for kings. The partner responds stepwise, as above.\n\n==Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB)==\nRoman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB) has largely replaced the standard version among tournament players. It developed from the ''Roman Blackwood'' variant (see above). According to RKCB there are five equivalent key cards rather than just the four aces: the trump king is counted as the 5th key card. The key card replies to 4NT are more compressed than standard ones and they also begin to locate the queen of trumps.\n\n{|\n|5{{Clubs}}||\u2013 0 or 3 key cards\n|-\n|5{{Diams}}||\u2013 1 or 4 key cards\n|-\n|5{{Hearts}}||\u2013 2 or 5 cards without the trump queen\n|-\n|5{{Spades}}||\u2013 2 or 5 key cards with the trump queen<ref>{{cite book | first1 = William S.|last1= Root |first2 = Richard |last2 = Pavlicek | year = 1981 | title = Modern Bridge Conventions | publisher = Crown Trade Paperbacks | isbn=0-517-58727-0|page = 236}}</ref>\n|}\n<!-- 1430 doesn't belong here -->\nAlthough the replies to 4NT are more compressed, it is almost always possible to infer which number of keycards is correct: 0 or 3, 1 or 4, 2 or 5. Evidence for that inference includes the entire auction as well as the number of key cards that the 4NT bidder holds.\n\nThe 5{{Hearts}} and 5{{Spades}} replies with 2 or 5 key cards also deny and show the trump queen, respectively. (Responder may also show the queen with extra length in trumps, where the ace and king will probably draw all outstanding cards in the suit.)\n\nThe 5{{Clubs}} and 5{{Diams}} replies tell nothing about the queen or extra length, but the 4NT bidder may ask about that using the cheapest bid other than five of the trump suit. The code for replies to that \"queen ask\" vary; a common rule is that the cheapest bid in the trump suit denies the queen or extra length and any other call shows it. An option is for the positive calls to show a feature, such as a king in that suit, and 6 of the trump suit can show the queen of trumps with no outside kings.\n\nRoman Key Card Blackwood is predicated on existence of a trump suit, which determines which of the four kings and queens responder should show as key cards. Trump agreement is not necessary, however. One common rule is that the last suit bid before 4NT bid is the key suit, lacking trump agreement.\n\n=== 1430 RKCB ===\nSome partnerships use the club response to show 1 or 4 and the diamond response to show 3 or none, dubbed \"1430\" (coincidentally the score for making a vulnerable small slam in a major suit), with the original version being dubbed \"3014\" when distinction is necessary. In order to facilitate the Queen Ask, an experts' version has been developed, where \"1430\" is used by the strong hand and \"3014\" is used by the weak hand. There are specific rules which determine when the asker hand is the weak one and when it is the strong one.<ref>Kantar (2008), page 8.</ref>\n\n== Key Card Blackwood (KCB) ==\n\nA half-way house between standard Blackwood and RKCB is Keycard Blackwood. Again there are five key cards, including the trump king, but unlike RKCB, the queen of trumps is not considered.\n\n5\u2663 \u2013 0 or 4 key cards<br />\n5{{Diams}} \u2013 1 or 5 key cards <br />\n5{{Hearts}} \u2013 2 key cards<br /> \n5\u2660 \u2013 3 key cards\n\nThis is advocated by Bernard Magee as being simpler for club players, as with RKCB players are sometimes unsure whether partner holds 0 or 3 key cards, or 1 or 4.\n\n== Asking bids other than 4NT ==\n\n===Kickback===\n\"Kickback\" is the variant of RKCB devised by [[Jeff Rubens]] in accordance with the [[Useful space principle]]. The step responses are the same as in RKCB, but the ask is not necessarily 4NT. Instead it is the 4-level bid immediately above the agreed trump suit; i.e.:\n{|\n|4{{Diams}}||\u2013 RKCB for clubs\n|-\n|4{{Hearts}}||\u2013 RKCB for diamonds\n|-\n|4{{Spades}}||\u2013 RKCB for hearts\n|-\n|4NT||\u2013 RKCB for spades\n|}\nKickback has the advantage that it saves bidding space and, especially for minor-suit fits, provides safety at the 5-level if the required key cards are missing. Because the Kickback bid would otherwise be a control bid, 4NT is usually substituted as the control bid in that suit (e.g., 4NT is a control bid in hearts if the agreed trump suit is diamonds). The drawback is that in unpracticed partnerships there can be confusion as to whether a bid is Kickback, a control bid or preference for a different strain:\n\n{{BridgeHandWE\n|A&thinsp;3|K&thinsp;10&thinsp;8&thinsp;6&thinsp;4&thinsp;2|K&thinsp;J&thinsp;9&thinsp;7|8\n|K&thinsp;10&thinsp;6&thinsp;4&thinsp;2|A|A&thinsp;Q&thinsp;10&thinsp;4|A&thinsp;5&thinsp;3}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:10px; margin-left:10px;\"\n!width=\"50%\"|West\n!width=\"50%\"|East\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1{{Hearts}}||1{{Spades}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2{{Hearts}}||3{{Diams}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|4{{Diams}}||4{{Hearts}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Pass||\n|}\n{{clear}}\nEast intended 4{{Hearts}} as Kickback, but West thought it was secondary support for hearts, and decided to pass with minimum values. As result, a reasonable grand slam in diamonds was missed.\n\nAn established partnership might have agreed that as hearts were not supported after opener's rebid, 4{{Hearts}} cannot possibly show support, and must be ace asking in diamonds.\n\n===Redwood===\n\"Redwood\" is a variation of Kickback that is only used when a minor suit is trumps. A 4 level bid in the suit above the agreed trump suit is the ace / key card ask and the name comes from the fact that this bid will always be a red suit:\n\n4{{Diams}}\u2013 RKCB for clubs\n\n4{{Hearts}}\u2013 RKCB for diamonds\n\nOnce key cards have been identified the next step bid (other than trumps) can be used to ask for Kings.\n\nOne advantage of this approach is that it avoids the potential for misunderstanding that can occur when using Minorwood but one disadvantage is that it uses up one more bid (than Minorwood) and might constrain the bidding later when asking for Kings or Queens.\n\nUsing \"Redwood,\" the ace/key card ask of 4NT is still used when the trump suit is a major (hearts or spades).\n\n===Minorwood===\n\"Minorwood\" is a variation of Blackwood, in which the minor suit which the partners agree will be trumps is itself used as the ace/key card ask. The ask will be at the four level. Hence:\n\n4{{Clubs}}\u2013 RKCB for clubs\n\n4{{Diams}}\u2013 RKCB for diamonds\n\nOne disadvantage to this convention is that either the partnership must agree to lose the natural 4 level bid in trumps or have clear agreement on which sequences are slam seeking and which are natural bids. The advantage of this approach is that it conserves bidding space.  For example, the use of Redwood reduces the risk of a misunderstanding but uses up one more bid and might constrain the bidding later when asking for Kings or Queens.\n\n===Exclusion Blackwood===\n'''Exclusion Blackwood''' or '''Voidwood'''.<ref name=\"BW\">[[The Bridge World]], May 1981 Volume 52, Number 8, page 23. ''Exclusion Blackwood'' by Ron Gerard.</ref> was devised by [[Bobby Goldman]]<ref>{{OEB|7|52}}</ref> as an attempt to resolve the situation when the Blackwood-asker has a void. In that case, he is not interested in the partner's ace in the void suit, as he already has the first-round control; partner's ace would present a duplicated value in that case. It should be noted, however, that many players, even experts, refuse to play Exclusion Blackwood because of the potential disaster of forgetting the agreement.\n\nIt is usually played as the Roman Key Card Blackwood, with only four key cards: the three Aces outside the void suit and the King of trumps. However, the asking bid is not 4NT, but the void suit \u2014 Voidwood is made by jumping on level 4 or 5 in the void suit after a fit has been found, for example:\n{|class=wikitable\n!width=\"50%\"|West\n!width=\"50%\"|East\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1{{Spades}}\n|3{{Spades}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|5{{Clubs}}\n| \n|}Bids of 5{{Clubs}}, 5{{Diams}} and 5{{Hearts}} present a Voidwood, denoting the void in the suit bid and asking for other key cards. The responses are, as in RKCB:\n*1st step \u2013 0 or 3 key cards (1 or 4, if playing 1430)\n*2nd step \u2013 1 or 4 key cards (0 or 3)\n*3rd step \u2013 2 key cards without trump queen\n*4th step \u2013 2 key cards with trump queen\n\n== Application ==\n{{howto|section|date=March 2011}}\n<!-- improved a lot, but still minor adjustments needed, immo. It hurts to destroy valuable information -->\nWhen the Blackwood bidder has a void, and partner shows one or more but not all missing aces, \"asker\" will not know whether partner's ace duplicates the void suit (where it would not be of great help) or covers side suit losers.  For this reason [[cue bid]] to show aces explicitly, or [[#Exclusion Blackwood|Exclusion]] or [[#Exclusion Blackwood|Voidwood]] convention to ask for useful aces, is  used with hands that contain a void.\n\nOften non-experts ask for aces when they really need other information from partner, acting act as if the convention is designed to ascertain whether the partnership holds ''all'' of the four aces or five key-cards. In fact the fundamental purpose should usually be to distinguish between lacking one and lacking two, because lacking two aces makes slam a bad bet. In other words, ace and key-card asking conventions should normally be used by one member of a partnership who plans at least to contract for 12 tricks if no more than one ace or key card is lacking.\n\n<!-- yadda yadda yadda -->A simplified way to think about Blackwood is this: \"I am concerned that we may lose the first two tricks, if we bid a slam. I can use Blackwood as a kind of insurance policy, to guarantee that this will not happen.\" But Blackwood will not help if, due to the structure of the hands, there are multiple ways to lose the first two tricks. It only helps, for the most part, if the exclusive risk of losing the first two tricks is due to the opponents' holding two cashable '''aces'''. Obviously, the opposition might hold the ace and king of a side suit, and could bang those tricks right down, resulting in an immediate set.\n\nThus, a player should use Blackwood only when he can ascertain that the partnership holds at least second-round controls in all suits (kings or, if a suit fit is found, singletons). Thus, a Blackwood query by the player holding two quick losers in a side suit is a wild gamble, as it is still possible that the suit is not controlled by an Ace or a King.\n\nFor the same reason, it is generally wrong to use Blackwood with a void. This is not always true, but the rule of thumb is: Don't use Blackwood with a void unless you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it. You may be missing two aces, but your void may compensate for the lack of one of the enemy aces. Thus, Blackwood will not tell you what you want to know: Are we at risk of losing the first two tricks? If your side has two aces and a void, then you are not at risk of losing the first two tricks, so long as (a) your void is useful (i.e., does not duplicate the function of an ace that your side holds) and  (b) you are not vulnerable to the loss of the first two tricks in the fourth suit (because, for instance, one of the partnership hands holds a singleton in that suit or the protected king, giving your side second round control).\n\nOther problems can easily occur when a minor is the agreed trump suit, or the key suit when no trump suit is agreed. The reply to Blackwood could take the partnership past their agreed suit and going to the next higher level may be one trick too high.  In these cases experts agree on using the Kickback or [[#Redwood convention|Redwood]] convention to save steps and be able to stop at 5{{Clubs}} or 5{{Diams}}. An alternative is to avoid using any type of Ace asking and use the cue bid alternative.\n\nA further problem occurs when, after hearing his partner's response, the player who bid 4NT wants to stop in 5NT \u2014 as this is a forcing bid asking for Kings. A common agreement is that the first non-suit asks responder to bid 5NT. Whenever the first non-suit is a \"queen ask\", then the next non-suit asks to bid 5NT. This has to be planned in advance as if there is no such space partners have to bid a usually unmakeable slam contract.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gerber convention]]\n* [[Grand slam force]]\n* [[Norman four notrump]]\n* [[Quantitative no trump bids]]\n* [[San Francisco convention|San Francisco]]\n* [[Slam-seeking conventions]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Ron Klinger]] in collaboration with Pat Husband and Andrew Kambites (1994).

His father, Wilfred Everett Bixby II, was a store clerk and his mother, Jane (n\u00e9e McFarland) Bixby, was a senior manager at [[I. Magnin|I. Magnin & Co.]] In 1942, when Bixby was eight years old, his father enlisted in the Navy during World War II and traveled to the South Pacific. While in the seventh grade, Bixby attended Grace Cathedral and sang in the church's choir. In one notable incident, he shot the bishop using a slingshot during a service and was kicked out of the choir. In 1946, his mother encouraged him to take ballroom dance lessons and from there he started dancing all around the city. While dancing, he attended [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]], where he perfected his oratory and dramatic skills as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Though he received average grades, he also competed in high-school speech tournaments regionally. After graduation from high school in 1952, against his parents' wishes, he majored in drama at [[City College of San Francisco]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/23/obituaries/bill-bixby-tv-actor-dies-at-59-starred-in-3-long-running-series.html|title=Bill Bixby, TV Actor, Dies at 59; Starred in 3 Long-Running Series|date=November 23, 1993|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=April 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], Bixby was drafted shortly after his eighteenth birthday.

Bixby\"}} Later, he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his parents' alma mater, and left just a few credits short of earning a degree. He then moved to [[Hollywood, California]], where he had a string of odd jobs that included bellhop and lifeguard. He organized shows at a resort in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], and in 1959 was hired to work as a model and to do commercial work for [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]].\n\n==Career==\n===Beginning acting===\nIn 1961, Bixby was in the musical ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'' at the Detroit Civic Theater, returning to Hollywood to make his television debut on an episode of ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''. He became a highly regarded [[character actor]] and guest-starred in many television series, including ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare (TV series)|Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[Straightaway]]'', and ''[[Hennesey]]''. He also joined the cast of ''The [[Joey Bishop]] Show'' in 1962. In 1963, he played a sailor with a Napoleon tattoo in the movie ''[[Irma La Douce]]'', a romantic comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, directed by Billy Wilder based on the 1956 French musical. During the 1970s, he made guest appearances on television series such as ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[Insight (TV series)|Insight]]'', ''[[Barbary Coast (TV series)|Barbary Coast]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'', four episodes of ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', and two episodes each of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' and [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]''.\n\n===''My Favorite Martian'' and other early roles===\n[[File:Bill Bixby My Favorite Martian 1965.JPG|thumb|upright|Bixby as Tim O'Hara in ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', when an accident turns Uncle Martin back into a baby (season 2, episode 6)]]\nBixby took the role of young reporter Tim O'Hara in the 1963 CBS sitcom, ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Ray Walston]]. By 1966, though, high production costs forced the series to come to an end after 107 episodes. After the cancellation of ''Martian'', Bixby starred in five movies: ''[[Ride Beyond Vengeance]]'', ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'', and two of [[Elvis Presley]]'s movies, ''[[Clambake (film)|Clambake]]'' and ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]''. He turned down the role as [[Marlo Thomas]]'s boyfriend in the successful ''[[That Girl]]'', though he later guest-starred in the show, and starred in two failed pilots.\n\n===''The Courtship of Eddie's Father''===\nIn 1969, Bixby starred in his second high-profile television role, as Tom Corbett in ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'', a [[comedy-drama]] on ABC. The series concerned a widowed father raising a young son, managing a major syndicated magazine, and at the same time trying to reenter the dating scene. This series was in the vein of other 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that dealt with [[widower]]hood, such as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[My Three Sons]]''. Eddie was played by novice actor [[Brandon Cruz]]. The pair developed a close rapport that translated to an off-camera friendship as well. The core cast was rounded out by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Miyoshi Umeki]], who played the role of Tom's housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston; [[James Komack]] (one of the series' producers) as Norman Tinker, Tom's pseudo-hippie, quirky photographer, and actress Kristina Holland as Tom's secretary, Tina. One episode of the series co-starred Bixby's future wife, [[Brenda Benet]], as one of Tom's girlfriends.\n\n[[File:Courtship of Eddies Father 1969.JPG|thumb|left|upright|With ''The Courtship of Eddie's Father'' co-stars, [[Brandon Cruz]] and [[Miyoshi Umeki]]]]\nBixby was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1971. The following year, he won the Parents Without Partners Exemplary Service Award for 1972.\n\nBixby made his directorial debut on the sitcom in 1970, directing eight episodes. ABC canceled the sitcom in 1972 at the end of season three.\n\nAfter the show was canceled, Bixby and Cruz remained in contact, with Cruz making a guest appearance on Bixby's later series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. The death of Bixby's only child, in 1981, drew Bixby and Cruz closer still. The two remained in touch until Bixby's death in 1993. In 1995, Cruz named his own son Lincoln Bixby Cruz.\n\nBrandon Cruz said of the show which developed a professional father-son relationship, compared to that of ''The Andy Griffith Show'', \"We dealt with issues that were talked about but were never brought up on television. Bill wasn't the first actor to portray a single widowed father, but he became one of the popular ones, because of his easy-going way of this crazy little kid.\" Prior to Bixby's promotion to director, Brandon said, \"He was looking for the best dolly grip, along with the boom operator that if something was called specifically and failed, Bill could be easily angry.\" On the kind of relationship Bill had wanted with his co-star, Brandon also said, \"Bill would never speak down to me. Bill treated me as an equal. He made sure that we had a lot of time together, just so he could kinda crawl inside my head and see what actually made a kid tick.\" Upon Bill's real-life father's death in 1971, Cruz stated: \"He had that type of mentality that the show must go on, thinking it was just a great T.V. show, after he broke down weeping.\"<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Bill Bixby biography| url=http://www.biography.com/people/bill-bixby-9542610 | work=A+E Networks Digital| date= | accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith about how Bill Bixby's fame was supposed to posthumously honor him for a Star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, Cruz said, \"When I found out they were putting this out, I thought, \u2018It\u2019s about time.\u2019 Bill Bixby had an amazing body of work, not only ''Courtship of Eddie\u2019s Father,'' but ''My Favorite Martian,'' ''The Magician,'' ''The Incredible Hulk'' and so many other things, as an actor, as a director \u2014 and he never got an Emmy. He\u2019s never been recognized posthumously by the Academy. And he doesn\u2019t have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That is criminal.... There are people who have stars that, not to be blunt, but I wouldn\u2019t bother spitting on their stars. Bill\u2019s talent would take a couple of blocks of stars compared to them.

The series was well liked but lasted only one season. An accomplished amateur magician himself, he hosted several TV specials in the mid-1970s which featured other amateur magicians, and was a respected member of the Hollywood magic community, belonging to [[The Magic Castle]], an exclusive club for magicians. During the show's popular, although short-lived, production, Bixby invited a few old friends along to co-star such as [[Pamela Britton]] (in her final role), [[Kristina Holland]] and Ralph O'Hara.\n\nAlso in 1973, he starred in ''[[Steambath (play)|Steambath]]'', a play by author [[Bruce Jay Friedman]], on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] with [[Valerie Perrine]] and Jose Perez.\n\nBixby became a popular game-show panelist, appearing mostly on ''[[Password]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''. He was also a panelist on the 1974 revival of ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' hosted by [[Richard Dawson]]. He had also appeared with Dawson on ''Cop-Out''. In 1974-1975, he directed four episodes of the eighth season of ''[[Mannix]]'', guest-starring as Mannix's friend-turned-villain in one of the episodes.\n\nIn 1975, he co-starred with [[Tim Conway]] and [[Don Knotts]] in the Disney movie ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', which was well received by the public.\n\nReturning to television, Bixby worked with [[Susan Blakely]] on ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', a highly successful television miniseries in 1976. He played a daredevil stunt pilot in an episode of the short-lived 1976 [[CBS]] adventure series ''[[Spencer's Pilots]]'', starring [[Gene Evans]]. In 1977, he co-starred in the pilot for the television series ''[[Fantasy Island]]''; starred in \"No Way Out\", the final episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''Twist in the Tale'');<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Anthology/TalesOfTheUnexpected.htm|title=CTVA US Anthology - \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (Quinn Martin/NBC)(1977)|website=ctva.biz}}</ref> and appeared with [[Donna Mills]], [[Richard Jaeckel]], and [[William Shatner]] in the last episode, \"The Scarlet Ribbon\", of NBC's Western series ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', starring [[Rod Taylor]] and [[Andrew Stevens]]. Bixby directed two episodes of ''The Oregon Trail''.\n\nIn 1976, he was honored with two [[Emmy Award]] nominations, one for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in Drama or Comedy for ''The Streets of San Francisco'' and the other for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Comedy or Drama Series for ''Rich Man, Poor Man''.\n\nBixby hosted ''[[Once Upon a Classic]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] from 1976 to 1980.\n\n===''The Incredible Hulk''===\nBixby starred in the role of Dr. David Banner in the pilot movie, ''The Incredible Hulk'', based on the [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] characters. [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]], the creator, director and writer, said that Bixby was his only choice to play the part.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fary |first=Lisa |title=Interviews: Kenneth Johnson (Part 1 of 2) Pink Raygun.com |url=http://www.pinkraygun.com/2007/06/07/interviews-kenneth-johnson-part-1-of-2/ |website=archive.li |date=April 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20130411172733/http://www.pinkraygun.com/2007/06/07/interviews-kenneth-johnson-part-1-of-2/ |archivedate=April 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Although, reportedly, when Bixby was offered the role, he declined it \u2013 until he read the script and discussed it with Johnson.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Mark|last2=Garcia|first2=Frank |title=Science Fiction Television Series: Episode Guides, Histories, and Casts and Credits For 62 Prime Time Shows, 1959 Through 1989|date=1996|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.] |isbn=0786400412}}</ref> The success of the pilot (coupled with some theatrical releases of the film in Europe) convinced CBS to turn it into a weekly series, which began airing in the spring of 1978. The pilot also starred [[Susan Sullivan]] as Dr. Elaina Marks, who tries to help the conflicted and widowed Dr. Banner overcome his \"problem\", and falls in love with him in the process. In a retrospective on ''The Incredible Hulk'', [[Glenn Greenberg]] declared Bixby's performance to be the series's \"foremost\" strength, elaborating that he \"masterfully conveyed the profound loneliness and tragedy of Dr. Banner while also bringing to the role an abundance of warmth, intelligence, humor, nobility, likability, and above all else, humanity.\"<ref name=\"Back70\">{{cite journal|last= Glenn|first= Greenberg|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= February 2014|title= The Televised Hulk|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|pages= 19\u201326|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the series' run, Bixby invited two of his longtime friends, [[Ray Walston]] and [[Brandon Cruz]], to guest-star with him in different episodes of the series. He also worked on the series with his friend, movie actress [[Mariette Hartley]], who later starred with Bixby in his final series, ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' in 1983. Hartley appears in the well-regarded double-length episode \"Married\",<ref name=\"Back70\"/> and subsequently won an Emmy Award for her guest appearance. Future star [[Loni Anderson]] also guest starred with Bixby during the first season. Bixby directed one episode of the series, \"Bring Me the Head of the Hulk\" in 1980 (original airdate: January 9, 1981). The series was canceled after the following season, but leftover episodes aired as late as the next June. Bixby later executive-produced and reprised the role in three television movies \u2013 ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]'', ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', and ''[[The Death of the Incredible Hulk]]'' \u2013 the last two of which he also directed, and the first of which he has been said to have unofficially co-directed.<ref name=\"Back70\"/>\n\n===Later work===\nBixby was executive producer and co-star of the short-lived sitcom ''Goodnight, Beantown'' (1983\u201384). He also directed three episodes of the series. During the same time, Bixby directed several episodes of another short-lived television series, ''[[Wizards and Warriors (TV series)|Wizards and Warriors]]'', which aired in 1983. From 1983 to 1984, he hosted a documentary series for [[Nickelodeon]] entitled ''[[Against the Odds (TV series)|Against the Odds]]''. The series, which was canceled after only two seasons, consists of short biographies of famous people throughout history. From 1986 to 1987, he hosted the syndicated weekday anthology series ''True Confessions''. In 1987, he directed eight episodes of the satirical police sitcom ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'', including the episode \"Hammer Hits the Rock\" in season two, where he made an uncredited appearance as Zeke.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0084642/bio|title=Bill Bixby: Biography|last=|first=|date=1990-2018|website=IMBd|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Bixby was executive producer of the three ''Hulk'' made-for-television sequel movies in the late 1980s and in 1990.

In 1648 one of their ships was stranded in [[Table Bay]], and the shipwrecked crew had to forage for themselves on shore for several months. They were so impressed with the natural resources of the country that on their return to the Republic, they represented to the directors of the company the great advantages to the Dutch Eastern trade to be had from a properly provided and fortified station of call at the Cape. The result was that in 1652, a Dutch expedition led by surgeon [[Jan van Riebeek]] constructed a fort and laid out vegetable gardens at Table Bay.\n\nLanding at Table Bay, Van Riebeek took control over [[Cape Town]], the settlement developed during the previous 10 years. In 1671 the Dutch first purchased land from the native [[Khoikhoi]] beyond the limits of the fort built by Van Riebeek; this marked the development of [[Dutch Cape Colony|the Colony proper]]. The earliest colonists were for the most part people of low station; but, as the result of the investigations of a 1685 commissioner, the government worked to recruit a greater variety of immigrants to develop a stable community. They formed a class of ''\"vrijlieden\"'', also known as ''\"vrijburgers\"'' (free citizens), former Company employees who remained at the Cape after serving their contracts.<ref name=Hunt1>{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=John|editor-last=Campbell|editor-first=Heather-Ann|title=Dutch South Africa: Early Settlers at the Cape, 1652\u20131708|date=2005|pages=13\u201335|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1904744955}}</ref> A large number of ''vrijburgers'' became independent farmers and applied for grants of land, as well as loans of seed and tools, from the Company administration.<ref name=Hunt1/>\n\nMore settlers were landed from time to time, including a number of orphan girls from [[Amsterdam]], and during 1688\u20131689, the colony was greatly strengthened by the arrival of nearly two hundred French [[Huguenots]]. Political refugees from the religious wars in France, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], they were settled at [[Stellenbosch]], [[Drakenstein]], [[Franschhoek]] and [[Paarl]].<ref>H. C. Viljoen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091025222633/http://geocities.com/sa_stamouers/huguenots.htm The Contribution of the Huguenots in South Africa], 25 OCtober 2009</ref> The influence of this small body of immigrants on the character of the Dutch settlers was marked. The Company in 1701 directed that only [[Dutch language|Dutch]] should be taught in the schools. This resulted in the Huguenots assimilating by the middle of the 18th century, with a loss to the community in the use and knowledge of [[French language|French]]. The little settlement gradually spread eastwards, and in 1754 the country as far as [[Algoa Bay]] was included in the colony.\n\n[[File:Flag of the Dutch East India Company.svg|thumb|upright=.75|Flag of the [[Dutch East India Company]]]]\nAt this time the European colonists numbered eight to ten thousand. They possessed numerous slaves, grew wheat in sufficient quantity to make it a commodity crop for export, and were famed for the good quality of their [[South African wine|wines]]. But their chief wealth was in cattle. They enjoyed considerable prosperity. \n\nThrough the latter half of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century, troubles arose between the colonists and the government. The administration of the Dutch East India Company was extremely [[despotism|despotic]]. Its policies were not directed at development of the colony, but to using it to profit the Company.  The Company closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded a large part of their produce as a kind of tax, and made other exactions.\n\n==== Trekboer ====\nFrom time to time, servants in the direct employment of the company were endowed with the right of \"freeburghers\"; but the company retained the power to compel them to return into its service whenever they deemed it necessary. This right to force into servitude those who might incur the displeasure of the governor or other high officers was not only exercised with reference to the individuals themselves who had received this conditional freedom; it was claimed by the government to be applicable likewise to the children of all such.\n\nThe effect of this [[tyranny]] was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and even before 1700 [[Trekboer|trekking]] began. In 1780, [[Joachim van Plettenberg]], the governor, proclaimed the [[Sneeuberge]] to be the northern boundary of the colony, expressing \"the anxious hope that no more extension should take place, and with heavy penalties forbidding the rambling peasants to wander beyond.\" In 1789, so strong had feeling amongst the burghers become that delegates were sent from the Cape to interview the authorities at [[Amsterdam]]. After this deputation, some nominal reforms were granted.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=150px>\nImage:Burchell02.jpg|Descending from the  Sneeuberge, a scene near [[Graaff-Reinet]], by [[William John Burchell|Burchell]]\nImage:Charles Michell03.jpg|Passing Cradock Pass, [[Outeniqua Mountains]], by [[Charles Collier Michell]]\nImage:Daniell Trekboer.jpg|An [[aquatint]] by [[Samuel Daniell]] of Trekboers making camp\nImage:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|Trekboers crossing the [[Karoo]] by [[Charles Davidson Bell]]\n</gallery>\n\nIt was largely to escape oppression that the farmers trekked farther and farther from the seat of government. The company, to control the emigrants, established a magistracy at [[Swellendam]] in 1745 and another at [[Graaff Reinet]] in 1786. The [[Gamtoos River]] had been declared, c. 1740, the eastern frontier of the [[Dutch Cape Colony|colony]]; but it was soon passed. In 1780, however, the Dutch, to avoid collision with the warlike [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes advancing south and west from east central Africa, agreed with them to make the [[Great Fish River]] the common boundary. In 1795 the heavily taxed burghers of the frontier districts, who were afforded no protection against the Bantus, expelled the officials of the [[Dutch East India Company]], and set up independent governments at [[Swellendam]] and [[Graaff Reinet]].\n\nThe [[trekboer|Trek Boers]] of the 19th century were the lineal descendants of the Trek Boers of the 18th century. What they had learnt of government from the Dutch East India Company they carried into the wilderness with them. The end of the 19th century saw a revival of this same tyrannical monopolist policy in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. If the formula, \u201cIn all things political, purely despotic; in all things commercial, purely monopolist,\u201d was true of the government of the Dutch East India Company in the 18th century, it was equally true of [[Paul Kruger|Kruger]]'s government in the latter part of the 19th.\n\nThe underlying fact which made the [[great Trek|trek]] possible is that the Dutch-descended colonists in the eastern and northeastern parts of the colony were not cultivators of the soil, but of purely pastoral and nomadic habits, ever ready to seek new pastures for their flocks and herds, and possessing no special affection for any particular locality. These people, thinly scattered over a wide territory, had lived for so long with little restraint from law that when, in 1815, by the institution of \u201cCommissions of Circuit,\u201d justice was brought nearer to their homes, various offences were brought to light, the remedying of which caused much resentment.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=150px>\nImage:Trekboer migration map.png|A map of the expansion of the Trekboers (1700\u20131800)\nImage:Nederlandse Kaapkolonie.svg|Evolution of the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] (1700\u20131800)\nImage:Kapkolonie 1795.jpg|Administrative divisions of the Dutch Cape Colony \nImage:Cape Colony00.jpg|Map of the [[Cape Colony]] in 1809, early [[History of the Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870|British rule]]\n</gallery>\n\n<!-- Quote is too big.

Eventually more than half of these people turned to the self-sufficient life of the trekboeren (literally \u201cwandering farmers\u201d but perhaps better translated as \"dispersed ranchers\").<br>The Boers were hostile toward indigenous African peoples, with whom they fought frequent range wars, and toward the government of the Cape, which was attempting to control Boer movements and commerce. They overtly compared their way of life to that of the Israel patriarchs of the Bible, developing independent patriarchal communities based upon a mobile pastoralist economy. Staunch Calvinists, they saw themselves as the children of God in the wilderness, a Christian elect divinely ordained to rule the land and the backward natives therein. By the end of the 18th century the cultural links between the Boers and their urban counterparts were diminishing, although both groups continued to speak a type of Flemish.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/71276/Boer Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online] Boer (people)</ref>\n |source =  [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]\n |align = right\n |width = 45em\n}} -->\n\n=== British involvement ===\nIn 1795, [[Dutch Republic|Holland]] having fallen under [[French First Republic|the revolutionary government of France]], a British force under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[James Henry Craig]] was sent to [[Cape Town]] to secure the colony for the [[William V, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]], a refugee in England\u200a, from the French. [[Dutch Cape Colony#Commanders and governors of the Cape Colony (1652\u20131806)|The governor of Cape Town]] at first refused to obey the instructions from the prince; but, when the British proceeded to take forcible possession, he capitulated. His action was hastened by the fact that the Khoikhoi, deserting their former masters, flocked to the British standard. The burghers of Graaff Reinet did not surrender until a force had been sent against them; in 1799 and again in 1801 they rose in revolt. In February 1803, as a result of the [[peace of Amiens]] (February 1803), the colony was handed over to the [[Batavian Republic]], which introduced many needed reforms, as had the British during their eight years' rule. One of the first acts of General Craig had been to abolish torture in the administration of justice. Still the country remained essentially Dutch, and few British settlers were attracted to it. Its cost to the British exchequer during this period was [[\u00a3]]16,000,000. The Batavian Republic entertained very liberal views as to the administration of the country, but they had little opportunity for giving them effect.\n\nWhen the [[War of the Third Coalition]] broke out in 1803, a British force was once more sent to the Cape. After an engagement (January 1806) on the shores of Table Bay, the Dutch garrison of [[Castle of Good Hope]] surrendered to the British under [[David Baird, 1st Baronet|Sir David Baird]], and in the [[1814 Anglo-Dutch treaty]] the colony was ceded outright by Holland to [[British Empire|the British crown]]. At that time the colony extended to the line of mountains guarding the vast central plateau, then called [[San people|Bushmansland]], and had an area of about 120,000 sq. m. and a population of some 60,000, of whom 27,000 were whites, 17,000 free Khoikhoi and the rest slaves, mostly imported blacks and Malays.\n\n==== Dislike of British Rule ====\nAlthough the colony was fairly prosperous, many of the Dutch farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with that of the Dutch East India Company, though their grounds for complaint were not the same. In 1792, [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravian]] missions had been established for the benefit of the [[Khoikhoi]], and in 1799 the [[London Missionary Society]] began work among both Khoikhoi and [[Bantus]]. The missionaries' championing of Khoikhoi grievances caused much dissatisfaction among the majority of the colonists, whose views temporarily prevailed, for in 1812 an ordinance was issued which empowered magistrates to bind Khoikhoi children as apprentices under conditions differing little from that of [[slavery]]. Meantime, however, the movement for the [[abolition of slavery]] was gaining strength in England, and the missionaries appealed from the colonists to the mother country. An incident which occurred in 1815\u20131816 did much to make permanent the hostility of the frontiersmen to the British.\n\n==== Slachter's Nek ====\nA farmer named Frederick Bezuidenhout refused to obey a summons issued on the complaint of a Khoikhoi, and, firing on the party sent to arrest him, was himself killed by the return fire. This caused a small [[rebellion]], known as [[Slachter's Nek Rebellion|Slachters Nek]], in 1815, called \u201cthe most insane attempt ever made by a set of men to wage war against their sovereign\u201d ([[Henry Cloete]]).  Upon its suppression, five ringleaders were publicly hanged at the spot where they had sworn to expel \u201cthe English tyrants.\u201d The feeling caused by the hanging of these men was deepened by the circumstances of the execution\u200a, \u200afor the scaffold on which the rebels were simultaneously hanged broke down from their united weight and the men were afterwards hanged one by one. An ordinance was passed in 1827, abolishing the old Dutch courts of [[landdrost]] and heemraden (resident [[magistrate]]s being substituted) and establishing that henceforth all legal proceedings should be conducted in English.  The granting in 1828, as a result of the representations of the missionaries, of equal rights with whites to the [[Khoikhoi]] and other free [[coloured]] people, the imposition (1830) of heavy penalties for harsh treatment of slaves, and finally the emancipation of the slaves in 1834, were measures which combined to aggravate the farmers' dislike of government. Moreover, the inadequate compensation awarded to slave-owners, and the suspicions engendered by the method of payment, caused much resentment; and in 1835 the farmers again removed to unknown country to escape an unloved government. [[Emigration]] beyond the colonial border had in fact been continuous for 150 years, but it now took on larger proportions.\n\n==== Sixth Frontier War ====\n[[File:Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835.png|thumb|300px|Eastern frontier of the colony, c. 1835\n{{legend|PaleGreen|Settled colonial area, showing districts established in 1820 (in various shades)}}\n{{legend|white|Neutral zone since 1820, as agreed by [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Somerset]] and the [[Ngqika|Gaika]] (Xhosa)}}\n{{legend|yellow|Tribal areas under British administration}}\n{{legend|red|Military forts and district boundaries}}]]\nThe year which witnessed the emancipation of the slaves and the creation of the first treaty state also saw the beginning of [[Xhosa Wars#Sixth war (1834\u20131836)|another disastrous Frontier war]]. Fighting began in December 1834, and lasted nearly a year. The [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] wrought great havoc; and Sir [[Benjamin D'Urban]], the governor, in order to secure peace, extended the boundary of the colony to the [[Kei River]]. The Xhosa had suffered much [[injustice]], especially from the [[commando]]-reprisal system, but they had also committed many injustices, and the vacillating policy of the Cape government was largely to blame for the disturbed state of the border. Sir Benjamin's policy\u200a, \u200awhich had support of both Dutch and British colonists\u200a, was one of close settlement by whites in certain districts and military control of the Bantus in other regions, and it would have done much to ensure peace.\n\n[[Lord Glenelg]], secretary for the colonies in [[Lord Melbourne]]'s [[Second Melbourne ministry|second administration]], held that the Xhosa were in the right in the quarrel, and he compelled D'Urban to abandon the conquered territory, a decision adopted largely on the advice of [[John Philip (missionary)|John Philip]] and his supporters. By 1836 a critical state had arisen in South Africa. The colonists had lost their slaves, the eastern frontier was in a state of insecurity, [[History of the Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870#1820 settlers|the British immigrants of 1820]] were still struggling against heavy odds, and the Dutch colonists were in a state of great indignation.<ref>Ransford, Oliver. The Great Trek. John Murray. Great Britain. 1972. p. 28.</ref>\n\n=== Great Trek ===\n{{Main|Great Trek}}\nThe [[Great Trek]] occurred between 1835 and the early 1840s. During that period some 12,000 to 14,000 Boers (including women and children), impatient of British rule, emigrated from [[Cape Colony]] into the great plains beyond the [[Orange River]], and across them again into [[Natalia Republic|Natal]] and the vastness of the [[Zoutspansberg]], in the northern part of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. Those Trekboere who occupied the eastern Cape were semi-nomadic. A significant number in the eastern Cape frontier later became Grensboere (\"border farmers\") who were the direct ancestors of the [[Voortrekkers]].\n[[File:Map of the Route of the Dorsland Trekkers.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Route of the [[Dorsland Trek]]kers (solid line)]]\n\n=== Anglo-Boer wars ===\n{{Main|First Boer War|Second Boer War}}\nThough the Boers accepted British rule without resistance in 1877, they fought two [[Boer Wars]] in the late 19th century to defend their internationally recognised independent countries, the republics of the Transvaal (the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]], or ZAR) and the [[Orange Free State]] (OFS), against the threat of annexation by the British Crown.\nThis led the key figure in organising the resistance, [[Paul Kruger]], into conflict with the British.<ref>{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Meredith |title=Diamonds, Gold, and War: The British, the Boers, and the Making of South Africa |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2007 |page=74 |isbn=978-1-58648-473-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Boer War diaspora ===\n{{See also|Afrikaner#Post Boer War diaspora|l1=Boer War diaspora}}\nAfter the second Anglo-Boer War, a Boer [[diaspora]] occurred. Starting in 1903, the largest group emigrated to the [[Patagonia]] region of [[Argentina]]. Another group emigrated to [[Kenya Colony|British-ruled Kenya]], from where most returned to South Africa during the 1930s, while a third group under the leadership of General [[Ben Viljoen]] emigrated to [[Mexico]] and to [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]] in the southwestern United States.\n\n=== Boer Revolt ===\n{{Main|Maritz Rebellion}}\nThe Maritz Rebellion (also known as the Boer Revolt, the Five Shilling Rebellion or the Third Boer War) occurred in 1914 at the start of [[World War I]], in which men who supported the re-creation of the old [[Boer republics]] rose up against the government of the [[Union of South Africa]] because they did not want to side with the British against [[Germany]] so soon after a long bloody war with the British.\n\nMany Boers had [[Germans|German ancestry]] and many members of the government were themselves former Boer military leaders who had fought with the Maritz rebels against the British in the [[Second Boer War]]. The rebellion was put down by [[Louis Botha]] and [[Jan Smuts]], and the ringleaders received heavy fines and terms of imprisonment. One, [[Jopie Fourie]], was convicted for treason when, as an officer in the [[South African Army|Union Defence Force]], he refused to take up arms with the British, and was executed in 1914.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:THE BULLOCK-WAGONS WOUND SLOWLY OVER THE BILLOWY PLAINS.gif|thumb|Painting depicting the Bullock waggons moving over the billowy plains, January 2, 1860]]\n=== Culture ===\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|Trekboere crossing the [[Karoo]]]]\nThe desire to wander, known as ''trekgees'', was a notable characteristic of the Boers.

The [[Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk]] was the national Church of the [[South African Republic]] (1852\u20131902). The [[Orange Free State]] (1854\u20131902) was named after the Protestant [[House of Orange]] in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe Calvinist influence, in such fundamental Calvinist doctrines such as unconditional [[predestination]] and [[divine providence]], remains present in much of Boer culture, who see their role in society as abiding by the national laws and accepting calamity and hardship as part of their Christian duty.<ref>[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/predestination.htm Calvinist Corner.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205172319/http://www.calvinistcorner.com/predestination.htm |date=5 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nA small number of Boers may also be members of [[Baptist]], [[Pentecostal movement|Pentecostal]] or [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]].\n\n== Modern usage ==\nDuring recent times, mainly during the [[apartheid]] reform and post-1994 eras, some white [[Afrikaans]]-speaking people, mainly with \"conservative\" political views and of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent, have chosen to be called \"Boere\", rather than \"Afrikaners,\" to distinguish their identity.<ref name=\"web. archive. org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422063509/http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/art/2007/2007mar/070309-bang.html Yolandi Groenewald. \"Bang bang \u2013 you\u2019re dead\"], ''Mail & Guardian Online''.</ref> They believe that many people of [[Voortrekker]] descent were not assimilated into what they see as the [[Cape Province|Cape]]-based Afrikaner identity.

Others contend, however, that these treaties dealt only with agreements between governmental entities and do not imply the recognition of a Boer cultural identity ''per se''.\n\nThe supporters of these views feel that the Afrikaner designation (or label) was used from the 1930s onwards as a means of unifying (politically at least) the white Afrikaans speakers of the Western Cape with those of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent (whose ancestors began migrating eastward during the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century and later northward during the [[Great Trek]] of the 1830s) in the north of South Africa, where the Boer Republics were established.<ref name=\"web. archive. org\"/>\n\nSince the Anglo-Boer war, the term \"Boerevolk\" was rarely used in the 20th century by the various regimes because of the effort to assimilate the Boerevolk with the Afrikaners.

The acts of merit or acts of valor must be less than that required for the [[Legion of Merit]] but must nevertheless have been meritorious and accomplished with distinction. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded only to service members in combat zones who are receiving imminent danger pay.\n\nThe Bronze Star Medal (without the \"V\" device) may be awarded to each member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, after 6 December 1941, was cited in orders or awarded a certificate for exemplary conduct in ground combat against an armed enemy between 7 December 1941 and 2 September 1945. For this purpose, the US Army's [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] or [[Combat Medical Badge]] award is considered as a citation in orders.

Reeder felt another medal was needed as a ground equivalent of the [[Air Medal]], and suggested calling the proposed new award the \"Ground Medal\".<ref>Reeder, Colonel Red. ''Born at Reveille''. New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce (1966), page 218.</ref> The idea eventually rose through the military bureaucracy and gained supporters. General [[George C. Marshall]], in a memorandum to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] dated 3 February 1944, wrote {{quote|The fact that the ground troops, Infantry in particular, lead miserable lives of extreme discomfort and are the ones who must close in [[personal combat]] with the enemy, makes the maintenance of their morale of great importance. The award of the Air Medal has had an adverse reaction on the ground troops, particularly the Infantry Riflemen who are now suffering the heaviest losses, air or ground, in the Army, and enduring the greatest hardships.}}\n\nThe Air Medal had been adopted two years earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 9419 dated 4 February 1944, retroactive to 7 December 1941. This authorization was announced in War Department Bulletin No. 3, dated 10 February 1944.\n\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]] amended Executive Order 9419 per Executive Order 11046 dated 24 August 1962 to expand the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. This allowed for awards where US service members become involved in an armed conflict where the United States was not a belligerent. At the time of the Executive Order, for example, the US was not a belligerent in Vietnam, so US advisers serving with the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces would not have been eligible for the award.\n\nSince the award criteria state that the Bronze Star Medal may be awarded to \"any person ... while serving in any capacity in or with\" the US Armed Forces, awards to members of foreign armed services serving with the United States are permitted. Thus, a number of Allied soldiers received the Bronze Star Medal in [[World War II]], as well as U.N. soldiers in the [[Korean War]], Vietnamese and allied forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and coalition forces in recent military operations such as the [[Gulf War]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and the [[Iraq War]]. A number of Bronze Star Medals with the \"V\" device were awarded to veterans of the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].\n\n===World War II infantry award===\nAs a result of a study conducted in 1947, the policy was implemented that authorized the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal (without the \"V\" device) to all soldiers who had received the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] or the [[Combat Medical Badge]] during [[World War II]]. The basis for doing this was that the badges were awarded only to soldiers who had borne the hardships which resulted in General Marshall's support of the Bronze Star Medal. Both badges required a recommendation by the commander and a citation in orders.<ref name=\"tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil\">[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/bronze_star.aspx Institute of Heraldry: Bronze Star Medal]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101010100/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/bronze_star.aspx |date=1 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===U.S. Air Force criteria controversy===\nIn 2012, two female U.S. airmen were allegedly subjected to [[cyber-bullying]] after receiving Bronze Star Medals for meritorious non-combat service. The two airmen, who had received the medals in March 2012, had been finance [[Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge|NCOICs]] in medical units deployed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]]. The awards sparked a debate as to whether or not the Air Force was awarding too many medals to its members, and whether the Bronze Star should be awarded for non-combat service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/archives/2013/03/28/tech-sgts-take-heat-after-receiving-medals/78535944/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220175154/http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/archives/2013/03/28/tech-sgts-take-heat-after-receiving-medals/78535944/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 December 2016|title=Tech. sgts. take heat after receiving medals|last=Schogol|first=Jeff|date=16 April 2012|publisher=|access-date=|work=[[Air Force Times]]}} </ref> This prompted the Air Force to take down stories of the two posted to the internet, and to clarify its criteria for awarding medals. The Air Force contended that meritorious service awards of the Bronze Star outnumber valor awards, and that it views awards on a case-by-case basis to maintain the integrity of the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123299369 |title=Air Force officials clarify Bronze Star approval process |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |publisher=[[US Air Force]] |last=Lyle |first=Amaani}}</ref>\n\nThis is not the first time that the USAF has been criticized for offering this award.

In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th&nbsp;century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of [[Ballarat East]] in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Location==\nWhile officially a part of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Ballarat is part of the Midlands geological region.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\" Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\". In some dialects, ''balla'' means \"bent elbow\", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning \"place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Ballarat: community profile|url=http://profile.id.com.au/ballarat/about|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.\n\n=== 1850s: Gold rush ===\n[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Eugene von Guerard]] of Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853\u201354]]\n\nThe first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, \"Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1737\u20131901\", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name=\"The Courier 1851-11-05\">{{cite news |title = Victoria |date = 5 November 1851 |work = The Courier |page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings.

The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.<ref>Geelong Ousts Ballarat. Population Surprises. ''The Argus'' (Melbourne), 28 April 1936, p. 10.</ref> During World War II an expanded Ballarat airport was the base of the [[RAAF]] Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for [[USAAF]] Liberator bomber squadrons. In 1942, Ballarat became connected to the state electricity grid by a 66,000 kV line.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Prior to this, power supply was generated locally.\n\nIn the [[post-war]] era, Ballarat's growth continued. In response to an acute housing shortage, significant suburban expansion occurred. An extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm|archivedate= 9 July 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref> The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 and 1962.\n\nThe 1950s brought a new optimism to the city. On 17 April 1952 it was announced that Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics,<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/> and work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission.<ref>Ballarat 'B' Power Station. Ballarat Historical Society \u2013 private collection</ref> The first [[Begonia Festival]], a highly successful community celebration, was held in 1953. [[Elizabeth II]] visited on 8 March 1954.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/> The Civic Centre, Prince Alfred Hall had burned down suspiciously that year; however a new Civic Hall was constructed and opened in March 1955. On 23 November 1956, the Olympic torch was carried through the city, and the following day the rowing events were held at the lake.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/> On 2 March 1958 the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] visited Ballarat.\n\nDuring the following decades, the city saw increased threats to its heritage. In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City Of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 \u2013 1975</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr|archivedate= 18 August 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n====Catholic Church Sexual Abuse====\n{{see also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat}}\nThe [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse#Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] final report published on 15 December 2017 found that 139 people made a claim of child sexual abuse to the Diocese of Ballarat between 1980 and 2015 and that there was 21 alleged perpetrators identified in claims.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.\n\nThe contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately {{convert|90|km2|0|abbr=on}} of the local government area's {{convert|740|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Land Use\">{{cite web |url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |title = Ballarat Planning Scheme \u2013 Land Use |accessdate = 14 May 2012 |date = 18 March 2010 |work = City of Ballarat |publisher = City of Ballarat |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420101928/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |archive-date = 20 April 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.<ref name=\"Land Use\"/> From the city centre this area extends approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north to the hills around Invermay, approximately {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on}} east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west along the plains to Lucas and approximately {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on}} south along the Yarrowee River and Canadian Creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.<ref name=\"HIS 2011-10\"/> The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee River and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs.

''[[The Courier (Ballarat)|The Courier]]'' is a daily and ''The Miner'' is a free weekly. The latter is distributed across most of the city on Wednesdays and contains news of community events, advertisements for local businesses, real estate and a classifieds section. Ballarat is the HUB of Fairfax Media Victoria's production and manufacturing with all printed material for the state coming from the Wendouree print site.\n\n===Radio stations===\n[[File:Radio house ballarat.jpg|thumb|upright|Radio House, Lydiard Street North.

Among the many local programs BTV6 produced, the 90&nbsp;minute live variety program ''Six Tonight'' (1971\u20131983), hosted by local Ballarat identity Fred Fargher, was one of the few live Australian programs of this type being presented in Australia.\n\nIn his 1999 book ''And Now Here's...'' (Four Decades of Behind the Scenes Fun in Australian Television), Mike McColl Jones fondly remembers local live television variety:\n\n<blockquote>\"... and in Ballarat, Victoria, a Tonight show (\"Six Tonight\") was carving its name into Australian television history. The show, hosted by Fred Fargher, ran for 13 years, and managed to attract many of the top name entertainers in the world, simply by offering them a limo ride to this beautiful country centre, a no-pressure spot on the show, and then a great dinner afterwards at one of the city's excellent restaurants. The sheer bravado of the offer enticed some of show business' biggest names\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}</blockquote>\n\nToday Ballarat is serviced by numerous \"free to air\" High Definition and Standard Definition Digital television services. Two television broadcasting stations are located in the city, including [[WIN Television|WIN]], WIN HD, [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] and [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] (sub-licensees of [[Network Ten]]) and [[Prime7]], Prime7 HD, [[7Two]], [[7mate]], and [[7flix]] (a sub-licensee of [[Seven Network]]). These two stations broadcast relayed services throughout regional Victoria. The city also receives [[Southern Cross Ten|Southern Cross Nine]], [[9HD]], [[9Gem]], [[9Go!]] and [[9Life]] (sub-licensees of the [[Nine Network]]) which is based in [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] but operates a local office.\n\nBallarat television maintains a similar schedule to the national television network but maintains local commercials and regional news programming[[VTV (TV station)|WIN]] produces a 30-minute local news bulletin each weeknight from its studios in the city, where bulletins for [[Albury]], [[Bendigo]], [[Gippsland]], [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]] and [[Mildura]] also originate. [[GLV/BCV|Southern Cross]] in conjunction with [[Nine News]] produces a 1-hour local news bulletin from its Melbourne studios combining regional, national and international news, screening Monday to Friday nights at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. In addition to commercial television services, Ballarat receives Government [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] (ABC1, ABC2, ABC3, ABC News 24) and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] (SBS One and Two) television services.\n\nOn 5 May 2011, analog television transmissions ceased in most areas of regional Victoria and some border regions including Ballarat and surrounding areas. All local free-to-air television services are now broadcasting in digital transmission only. This was done as part of the federal government's plan for [[digital terrestrial television in Australia]], where all analogue transmission systems are gradually turned off and replaced with modern [[DVB-T]] transmission systems.\n\nSubscription television services are provided by [[Neighbourhood Cable]], [[Foxtel]] and [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]].\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Ballarat}}\n[[File:University of Ballarat SMB Campus Lydiard Street Sth.jpg|thumb|Federation University Australia's SMB campus is set among the heritage buildings of Lydiard Street Sth including the former School of Mines and Industry (left), former Supreme Court and [[former Ballarat Gaol]] (rear)]]\n[[File:Ballarat School of Mines 001.JPG|thumb|School of Mines Building]]\nBallarat has two universities, [[Federation University Australia|Federation University]] and a campus of the [[Australian Catholic University]].\n\nFormerly the [[University of Ballarat]], Federation University Australia was opened in 2014.

The Roman army of three legions was soundly defeated, and [[Roman emperor]]s [[Decius]] and his son [[Herennius Etruscus]] were both killed during battle. They became the first Roman emperors killed by a foreign enemy. It was one of the worst defeats suffered by the Roman Empire against Germanics, rated by the Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as on par with the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in AD&nbsp;9, the [[Marcomanni]]c [[Marcomannic Wars#Roman expedition against the Iazyges and the Germanic invasion of Italy|invasion]] of [[Roman Italy]] in 170, and the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.\n\nIn 250\u2013251, a barbarian coalition under the Gothic king Cniva crossed the Roman [[Danube]] frontier, defeated the Roman Emperor Decius at [[Battle of Beroe|Beroe]] and [[Battle of Philippopolis (250)|captured]] the city of [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] with the help of treason and a stratagem, taking booty and captives. In the summer of 251, as Cniva's force began to return home, Decius, along with his son and co-emperor Herennius Etruscus, fell upon the Goths with an army of three [[Roman legions]].{{sfn|de Blois|2017|p=47}}\n\nIn the battle that ensued, Cniva divided his army into three groups, including one concealed behind a swamp. The Romans achieved initial success against a part of the Gothic army, but were then ambushed in the swamp by Cniva's hidden force and massacred under a barrage of Gothic missiles. Herennius was probably killed by an arrow prior to or during the battle and Decius died in the midst of the chaos and slaughter, buried under the mud. Their bodies were never found. The Goths went on to capture the Imperial [[treasury]] of [[gold coin]]s.{{sfn|de Blois|2017|p=47}}\n\nThe new Roman Emperor [[Trebonianus Gallus]] was forced to allow the Goths to return home with their loot and prisoners. The defeat was a complete disaster for Rome, with the emperor's death leading to more political instability and the loss of troops permitting repeated barbarian invasions in the region for the next two decades. The barbarians would not be expelled from Roman territory until 271.{{sfn|de Blois|2017|p=47}}\n\n==Location==\nThe long-debated location of Abritus was believed to have been established ({{convert|1|km|abbr=off}} east of the city of Razgrad) after the excavations published by T.

Two factors had contributed to growing unrest in the area north of Danube. First, Decius' predecessor [[Philip the Arab]] had refused to continue payments, initiated by Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 238, of annual subsidies to the aggressive tribes of the region.<ref>Southern 2001, p.347</ref> Second and more important, there were continuous movements of new peoples since the time of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]].<ref>Potter 2004, p.244</ref> Decius may also have taken with him troops from the Danube frontier, in order to depose Philip in 249.  He probably had with him three legions: [[legio XIV Gemina]] from [[Carnuntum]], [[legio IV Flavia Felix]] from [[Singidunum]], and [[legio VII Claudia]] from [[Viminacium]] and/or their [[vexillationes]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/13213004/The_Battle_of_Abrittus_the_Imperial_Treasury_and_Aurei_in_Barbaricum_Numismatic_Chronicle_173_2013_s._151-170|title=The Battle of Abrittus, the Imperial Treasury and Aurei in Barbaricum, Numismatic Chronicle 173, 2013, p 161}}</ref>\n\nThe resultant military vacuum would inevitably attract invaders.<ref>Southern 2001, p.222. Wolfram 1988, p.45</ref>\n\nThe course of events is not clear. It seems that in 250 the [[Carpians|Carpi]] invaded Dacia, eastern [[Moesia Superior]] and western Moesia Inferior.<ref name = CAH/> At the same time, a tribal coalition under Cniva crossed the Roman frontier, probably advancing in two columns. Whether these were consisted only of Goths is rather unlikely so the name \"Scythians\" by which the Greek sources called them (a geographical definition) seems more appropriate.<ref>D. S. Potter prefers to call them \"Scythians\", since the 4th century \"Goths\" cannot be easily connected with their supposed ancestors 100 years above. See Potter 2004, p.246</ref> It is quite possible that other people of Germanic and Sarmatian origin (like [[Bastarnae]], [[Taifals]] and [[Hasdingi|Hasdingian Vandals]]), perhaps Roman deserters as well, had joined the invaders.<ref name = Wolfram1/> However, the name of the king is indeed Gothic and probably genuine.<ref name=Potter1a>Potter 2004, p.245. He suggest that, since the name Cniva doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings by Jordanes, the latter found it in a genuine 3rd century source.</ref>\n\nThe first column of Cniva's army, a detachment of about 20,000 or so likely led by the chieftains Argaith and Gunteric, besieged [[Marcianopolis]], without success it seems.<ref>Potter 2004, p.46 and, in more detail, Wolfram 1988, pp.45,397. Although Jordanes (''Getica'', 91) places these chieftains under the command of Cniva's predecessor (a certain [[Ostrogotha]]), Wolfram and other scholars argue that it is plausible to regard their campaign as part of Cniva's invasion</ref> Then they probably headed south to besiege Philippopolis (now [[Plovdiv]] in Bulgaria). Cniva's main column of 70,000 under the King himself crossed Danube at [[Oescus]] then headed eastwards to [[Novae]], where he was repelled by the provincial governor (and future emperor) [[Trebonianus Gallus]].<ref>Jordanes, par.101.</ref><ref name=CAH>''The Cambridge Ancient History'', vol XII, 38</ref> Then the invaders headed south to plunder [[Nicopolis ad Istrum]] where Decius [[Battle of Nicopolis ad Istrum|defeated]] them but not decisively.<ref>Bird 1994, p.129</ref> After these initial setbacks, the barbarians moved southwards through [[Balkan Mountains|Haemus mountain]] and Decius pursued them (likely through the [[Shipka Pass#Shipka Pass|Shipka Pass]]) to save Philippopolis.<ref name = Wolfram2/> This time Decius' army was taken by surprise while resting at [[Stara Zagora|Beroe]]/Augusta Traiana. The Romans were heavily defeated in the ensuing [[Battle of Beroe|battle]]. Decius was forced to withdraw his army to the north at Oescus, leaving Cniva ample time to ravage Moesia and finally capture Philippopolis in the summer of 251, in part with the help of its commander, a certain [[Titus Julius Priscus]] who had proclaimed himself Emperor.<ref>Wolfram 1988, p.46, suggests summer of 250 as the date of the fall of Philippopolis and spring of 251 as the earliest date for the beginning of Cniva's returning to his base</ref> It seems that Priscus, after receiving the news of the defeat at Beroe, thought that the Goths would spare him and the city. He was wrong and was probably killed when the city fell.<ref  name=Southern1>Southern 2001, p.222. Bird 1994, p.129</ref> Then the Scythians began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.<ref name = Wolfram2/>\n\nIn the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, consisting of 80,000 men according to [[Dexippus]], accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general [[Trebonianus Gallus]], intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty.{{sfn|de Blois|2017|p=47}} Decius had lost a force of [[auxilia]]ry soldiers due to their \"wrongdoing\", according to Dexippus.{{sfn|de Blois|2017|p=47}} Archaeology has revealed the presence of three legions at the battle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/13213004/The_Battle_of_Abrittus_the_Imperial_Treasury_and_Aurei_in_Barbaricum_Numismatic_Chronicle_173_2013_s._151-170|title=The Battle of Abrittus, the Imperial Treasury and Aurei in Barbaricum, Numismatic Chronicle 173, 2013, p 161}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nIn either June,<ref>Potter 2004, p.243.

It seems impossible that the shattered Roman legions proclaimed emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks. Another strong point against Gallus' treason is the fact that he adopted [[Hostilian]], the younger son of Decius, after returning to Rome.<ref name=Potter3>Potter 2004, p.247</ref><ref name=Southern2>Southern 2001, p.308</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nGallus, who became emperor upon Decius' death, negotiated a treaty with the Goths under duress, which allowed them to keep their booty and return to their homes on the other side of the Danube. It is also possible that he agreed to pay  an annual tribute in return for the Goths' promise to respect Roman territory.<ref>Southern 2001, p.76</ref> This humiliating treaty, the contemporary spread of [[Plague of Cyprian]] with its devastating effects and the chaotic situation in the East with the Sassanian invasions left Gallus with a very bad reputation amongst the latter Roman historians. However, D. S. Potter suggests that, before the defeat at Abritus, the situation was not so serious that the available Roman forces would not be able to manage the invasions. Therefore, it is Decius' bad conduct which was responsible for the disastrous turn of the events.<ref name=Potter1>Potter 2004, p.245</ref> In any case, Gallus had no choice but to get rid of the Goths as soon as possible.<ref name=Wolfram2>Wolfram 1988, p.46</ref>\n\nIn 271, the Emperor [[Aurelian]] conclusively defeated the Goths and killed their king Cannobaudes in battle. Based on the similarity of the names, that king might coincide with the king Cniva who defeated Decius in Abritus.<ref>Southern 2001, p.116, 225</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman army]]\n*[[Gothic and Vandal warfare]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Aurelius Victor]], ''De Caesaribus'', par. 29.4\u20135 in ''Liber de Caesaribus of Sextus Aurelius Victor'', critical edition by H.

Their preferred tactic was to avoid an open field battle, and to fight from the cover of a huge fortified camp.\n\n==First day of battle==\n2000 Polish cavalry (one regiment under the command of [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander Koniecpolski]], supported by [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski|Jerzy Lubomirski]], six [[Towarzysz pancerny|pancerni]] cavalry companies of [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]] and [[Winged Hussars]] under the command of [[Stefan Czarniecki]]) repulsed the Tatars, who suffered heavy losses.\nDuring the first day of \"skirmishes by the Tatar and Cossack vanguard regiments\", the Poles were victorious \"since their army sustained that first attack cheerfully and in high spirits\".<ref name=\"H305\">Hrushevsky, p. 305</ref>\n\n==Second day of battle==\nThe Poles, encouraged by their success on the first day, deployed all their available cavalry against the \"main Tatar horde\" and \"Cossack vanguard regiments\".<ref name=\"H305\" /> The Polish infantry and artillery remained in camp and did not support the cavalry.

With the battle already turning against them, the Tatar forces panicked, \"abandoning the Khan's camp as it stood\", and fled the battlefield leaving most of their belongings behind. Khmelnytsky and Vyhovsky with a few Cossacks chased Khan attempting to bring him with his force back, but were taken hostage to be released when the battle was over.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 306\u2013307</ref> A heavy rain started which complicated cavalry operations. With the Tatar cavalry gone, the Cossacks moved their wagons in the night to a better defensive position closer to the river, dug trenches and constructed walls to the Polish surprise in the morning.\n\n==The siege of the Cossack camp==\nThe Polish army and Cossack camp exchanged artillery fire for ten days while both sides built fortifications. The Poles tried to blockade the camp.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 314 and 316</ref> Leaderless without Khmelnytsky, the Cossacks were commanded by Colonel Filon Dzhalalii, who was replaced by [[Ivan Bogun|Ivan Bohun]] on July 9. Other accounts state the commander was Matvii Hladky.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 314\u2013315</ref> The Cossack morale was decreasing and desertions started to the other river side, though they maintained a high rate of artillery fire and made occasional sorties. When the offered terms for surrender were rejected, the Poles prepared to dam the Pliashivka River so as to flood the Cossack camp. [[Stanis\u0142aw Lanckoro\u0144ski (hetman)|Stanis\u0142aw Lanckoro\u0144ski]] with a 2 thousand cavalry force moved across the river on July 9 to complete encirclement of the Cossacks. When they found out of the Polish advance, Bohun called for a council with other leaders of the registered Cossacks on further actions.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 317\u2013318</ref> However none of the peasant militia was invited to the council. The Cossacks built 3 bridges and Bohun led 2 thousand cavalry with 2 cannons to the other river side by the morning of July 10 to attack Lanckoro\u0144ski. The uninformed peasants thought they were abandoned, started to panic and flee across the river.<ref>Hrushevsky, p. 318</ref> Lanckoro\u0144ski didn't expect a large movement in his direction and retreated. Bohun returned to the camp and tried to restore order, but in vain. The main Polish force observed the disorder, but didn't launch an attack on the Cossack camp immediately thinking of a trap. They assaulted eventually, breached the defences and made their way to the river crossing. A few Cossack regiments managed to retreat in order though. Some Cossacks drowned, but archaeological excavations on the river crossing site revealed about a hundred Cossack human remains all having damage due to cold weapons to their bones which suggested heavy fighting. A rearguard of 200 to 300 Cossacks protected the river crossing; all of them were killed in battle rejecting surrender offers. \"Khmelnytsky's tent was captured intact, with all his belongings\", which included two banners, one he received from John II Casimir's 1649 commission and one from [[Wladyslaw IV]] in 1646.<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 321\u2013322</ref> Although it was difficult to estimate how many Cossacks and peasants were killed in the retreat, Piasecki and Brzostowski, who participated in the battle, mentioned 3,000 killed. Tsar's ambassador [[podyachy]] Bogdanov in his report to Moscow mentioned 4,000 killed.<ref name=\"Igor Svieshnikov, p. 124\">Igor Svieshnikov, p. 124</ref> Most Cossack artillery pieces were either lost to the Poles or drowned in the marshes.

He was then able to reassemble the Cossack host, which was able to present a substantial army to confront the Poles at the [[Battle of Bila Tserkva (1651)]]. Poland and \"the bulk of the rebels make peace in the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]]\" on 28 September 1651, which \"reduces the number of registered Cossacks from 40,000 to 20,000 and deprives them of the right to settle in or control various provinces of Ukraine previously allowed to them under the [[Treaty of Zboriv]]\".<ref name=\"Tucker, p. 622\">Tucker, p. 622</ref> The Ukrainian revolt, far from ending, would continue for several more years under Khmelnytsky.<ref name=\"Tucker, p. 622\"/>\n[[Image:Battle of Beresteczko 1651.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Battle of Berestechko by Vernier]]\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Samuel Twardowski]]'s narrative poem, ''The Civil War'', describes the setting for the battle along the Styr River:<ref>Hrushevsky, pp. 303\u2013304</ref>\n\n<poem>\nThere is a little town on it,\nIn the middle of Volhynia, called Berestechko,\nBelonging to the Leszczynski family, that was not as famous in the past\nAs it has now become \u2013 both ancient [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]\nAnd [[Khotyn]] are far outshone by it, because as many heads here\nOur eyes have seen as at [[Thermopylae]]\nOr [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] they counted, although there the whole strength\nOf Europe and Asia had come together.\nSince our arrival \u2013 hilly roads\nAnd steep slopes, until open\nMeadows unfold near the Styr's\nLow banks.

He claimed nobility when it suited him, and it was not often disputed by his contemporaries. Khmelnytsky/Chmielnicki once wrote in a letter to King [[Jan Kazimierz]] that he was \"born Chmielnicki;\" however, that surname was never associated with the [[Abdank coat of arms]] hesed. His father, a noble, was married to a [[Cossack]] woman and, according to the [[Polish Statute of 1505]], his mother's status might have prevented Bohdan from being considered a nobleman. Other historians' theories suggest that his father or grandfather was stripped of noble status.

Khmelnytsky identified as a noble, and his father's status as a deputy [[Starosta]] ([[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]) of Chyhyryn helped him to be considered as such by others. During the Uprising, however, Khmelnytsky would stress his mother's Cossack roots and his father's exploits with the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Cossacks of the Sich]].\n\nKhmelnytsky's early education cannot be documented, however it is speculated that he received his elementary education in Ukrainian<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CH%5CKhmelnytskyBohdan.htm|title=Bohdan Khmelnytsky Article|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>. Several historians believe he received his elementary schooling from a church clerk until he was sent to one of [[Kiev]]'s Orthodox fraternity schools. He continued his education in Polish at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college, possibly in [[Jaros\u0142aw]], but more likely in [[Lviv]] in the school founded by hetman \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski. He completed his schooling by 1617, acquiring a broad knowledge of world history and learning Polish and Latin. Later he learned Turkish, [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]], and French. Unlike many of the other Jesuit students, he did not embrace Roman Catholicism but remained [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].\n\n===Marriage and family===\nBohdan Khmelnytsky married Hanna Somkivna, a daughter of a rich [[Principality of Pereslavl|Pereyaslavl]] Cossack; the couple settled in [[Subotiv]]. By the second half of the 1620s, they had three daughters: Stepanida, Olena, and Kateryna. His first son [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish (Tymofiy)]] was born in 1632, and another son [[Yuriy Khmelnytsky|Yuriy]] was born in 1640.\n\n==Service with Cossacks==\n{{Cossacks}}\nUpon completion of his studies in 1617, Khmelnytsky entered into service with the Cossacks. As early as 1619 he was sent together with his father to [[Moldavia]], when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth entered into war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His first military engagement was a tragic one. During the [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|battle of Cecora]] (\u021au\u021bora) on 17 September 1620, his father was killed, and young Khmelnytsky, among many others including future hetman [[Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski]], was captured by the Turks. He spent the next two years in captivity in [[Constantinople]] as a prisoner of an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] [[Kapudan Pasha]] (presumably [[Parlak Mustafa Pasha]]).<ref name=\"SS51\">V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. ''Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret.'' page 51. Lebid. Kiev. 1995.</ref> Other sources claim that he spent his slavery in [[Ottoman Navy]] on [[galley]]s as an [[oarsman]], where he picked up a knowledge of [[Turkic languages]].<ref name=\"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\"/>\n\nWhile there is no concrete evidence as to his return to Ukraine, most historians believe Khmelnytsky either escaped or was ransomed. Sources vary as to his benefactor &mdash; his mother, friends, the Polish king &mdash; but perhaps by [[Krzysztof Zbaraski]], ambassador of the Commonwealth to the [[Ottomans]]. In 1622 he paid 30,000 [[thaler]]s in ransom for all [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] captured at the Battle of Cecora. Upon return to Subotiv, Khmelnytsky took over operating his father's estate and became a [[Registered Cossacks|registered Cossack]] in the [[Chyhyryn Regiment]]. He was later promoted to [[pysar]] (a historical officer title among Cossacks). From 1625, he participated in several sea raids on [[Constantinople]] together with [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. In those raids he earned his title of [[sotnyk]] (a leader of a hundred).\n\nDuring this period his widowed mother remarried, to [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] noble Vasyl Stavetsky, and moved to his estate, leaving Khmelnytsky in charge of Subotiv. Within year she gave birth to another son, Hryhoriy; later he took his mother's name, becoming known as Hryhoriy Khmelnytsky. For a short time, the senior Khmelnytsky served as a [[koniuszy]] to hetman [[Miko\u0142aj Potocki]] but departed relatively quickly after a personal conflict.\n\nKhmelnytsky ran his estate and advanced in rank in his regiment. He first became a [[sotnyk]] and later advanced to the rank of a regiment scribe. He had significant negotiation skills and commanded respect of his fellow Cossacks. On 30 August 1637, he was included in a delegation to [[Warsaw]] to plead the Cossacks' case before the Polish King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]. Serving in the army of a Polish magnate and respected commander, hetman Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski, he participated in a successful campaign when the Commonwealth army (and his regiment) scored a decisive victory over the [[Crimean Khanate]] in 1644. According to archival documents, he also had a meeting in Warsaw with the French ambassador Count De Bregie, during which he discussed the possibility of Cossack participation in war in France. Sources vary as to whether in April 1645 he travelled to France (to [[Fontainebleau]]) to discuss further details of Cossack service in France; this claim is supported by Ukrainian historiography but disputed by Polish scholarship.<ref name=\"SS70\">V.

He laid claim to Khmelnytsky's estate, claiming it as his. Trying to find protection from this grab by the powerful magnate, Khmelnytsky wrote numerous appeals and letters to different representatives of the Polish crown but to no avail. At the end of 1645 the Chyhyryn [[starosta]] [[Daniel Czapli\u0144ski]] officially received authority from Koniecpolski to seize Khmelnytsky's Subotiv estate.\n\n[[File:Anonymous Bohdan Khmelnytsky.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Bohdan Khmelnytsky (c. 1650) in the District Museum in [[Tarn\u00f3w]].

W\u0142adys\u0142aw, who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned, gave Khmelnytsky a royal charter, protecting his rights to the Subotiv estate. But, because of the structure of the Commonwealth at that time and the lawlessness of Ukraine, even the King was not able to prevent a confrontation with local magnates. In the beginning of 1647, Daniel Czapli\u0144ski started to harass Khmelnytsky in order to force him off the land. On two occasions the magnate had Subotiv raided: considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytsky's son Yuriy was badly beaten. Finally, in April 1647, Czapli\u0144ski succeeded in evicting Khmelnytsky from the land, and he was forced to move with his large family to a relative's house in Chyhyryn.\n\nIn May 1647, Khmelnytsky arranged a second audience with the king to plead his case but found him unwilling to confront a powerful magnate. In addition to losing the estate, Khmelnytsky suffered the loss of his wife Hanna, and he was left alone with their children. He promptly remarried, to Motrona ([[Helena Czapli\u0144ska]]), the so-called \"[[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of the steppe\". He was less successful in real estate, and was unable to regain the land and property of his estate or financial compensation for it. During this time, he met several higher Polish officials to discuss the Cossacks' war with the Tatars, and used this occasion again to plead his case with Czapli\u0144ski, still unsuccessfully.\n\nWhile Khmelnytsky found no support from the Polish officials, he found it in his Cossack friends and subordinates. His Chyhyryn regiment and others were on his side. All through the autumn of 1647 Khmelnytsky travelled from one regiment to another, and had numerous consultations with Cossack leaders throughout Ukraine. His activity raised suspicion among the local Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts; he was promptly arrested. Koniecpolski issued an order for his execution, but the Chyhyryn Cossack [[polkovnyk]], who held Khmelnytsky, was persuaded to release him. Not willing to tempt fate any further, Khmelnytsky headed for the [[Zaporozhian Sich]] with a group of his supporters.\n\n==Uprising==\n{{Main|Khmelnytsky Uprising}}\n[[File:Matejko Khmelnytsky with Tugay Bey.jpg|thumb|Bohdan Khmelnytsky (''left'') with [[Tugay Bey]] (''right'') at [[Lviv]], oil on canvas by [[Jan Matejko]], 1885, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]\n\nWhile the Czapli\u0144ski Affair is generally regarded as the immediate cause of the uprising, it was primarily a catalyst for actions representing rising popular discontent.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Religion, ethnicity, and economics factored into this discontent. While the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] remained [[Union of Lublin|a union]] of nations, a sizable population of Orthodox [[Ruthenians]] were ignored. Oppressed by the Polish magnates, they took their wrath out on Poles, as well as Jewish traders, who often managed the estates of Polish nobles. The advent of the [[Counter-Reformation]] worsened relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Many Orthodox Ukrainians considered the [[Union of Brest]] as a threat to their Orthodox faith.\n\n==Initial successes==\nAt the end of 1647 Khmelnytsky reached the [[estuary]] of the [[Dnieper]] river. On 7 December, his small detachment (300\u2013500 men), with the help of registered Cossacks who went over to his side, disarmed the small Polish detachment guarding the area and took over the Zaporozhian Sich.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Poles attempted to retake the Sich but were decisively defeated as more registered Cossacks joined the forces. At the end of January 1648, a [[Cossack Rada]] was called and Khmelnytsky was unanimously elected a [[hetman]]. A period of feverish activity followed. Cossacks were sent with hetman's letters to many regions of Ukraine calling on Cossacks and Orthodox peasants to join the rebellion, [[Khortytsia]] was fortified, efforts were made to acquire and make weapons and ammunition, and emissaries were sent to the [[Khan of Crimea]], [[\u0130sl\u00e2m III Giray]].\n\nInitially, Polish authorities took the news of Khmelnytsky's arrival at the Sich and reports about the rebellion lightly. The two sides exchanged lists of demands: the Poles asked the Cossacks to surrender the mutinous leader and disband, while Khmelnytsky and the Rada demanded that the Commonwealth restore the Cossacks' ancient rights, stop the advance of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], yield the right to appoint Orthodox leaders of the Sich and of the Registered Cossack regiments, and to remove Commonwealth troops from Ukraine.<ref>V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. ''Sotsialno-politychnyi portret.'' page 91, Lebid, Kiev. 1995</ref> The Polish magnates considered the demands an affront, and an army headed by Stefan Potocki moved in the direction of the Sich.\n\nHad the Cossacks stayed at Khortytsia, they might have been defeated, as in many other rebellions. However, Khmelnytsky marched against the Poles. The two armies met on 16 May 1648 at [[Battle of Zhovti Vody|Zhovti Vody]], where, aided by the Tatars of [[Tugay Bey]], the Cossacks inflicted their first crushing defeat on the Commonwealth. It was repeated soon afterwards, with the same success, at the [[Battle of Korsu\u0144]] on 26 May 1648. Khmelnytsky used his diplomatic and military skills: under his leadership, the Cossack army moved to battle positions following his plans, Cossacks were proactive and decisive in their manoeuvrers and attacks, and most importantly, he gained the support of both large contingents of registered Cossacks and the [[Giray dynasty|Crimean Khan]], his crucial ally for the many battles to come.\n\n===Establishment of Cossack Hetmanate===\n[[File:Herb Viyska Zaporozkogo (Alex K).svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]]]\n\nAt Christmas in 1648, Khmelnytsky made a triumphant entry into Kiev, where he was hailed as \"the [[Moses]], saviour, redeemer, and liberator of the people from Polish captivity... the illustrious ruler of Rus.\"{{citation needed|reason=quote needs cite|date=August 2017}} The [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] Paiseus, who was visiting Kiev at this time, referred to Khmelnytsky as the Prince of Rus, the head of an independent Ukrainian state, according to contemporaries.<ref name=\"Hrushevsky,M 2003\">[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky,M.]] ''History of Ukraine-Rus''.

A [[Vilnius]] [[panegyric]] in Khmelnytsky's honour (1650&ndash;1651) said: \"While in Poland it is King [[Jan II Casimir Vasa]], in Rus it is Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky.\"<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\\K\\H\\KhmelnytskyBohdan.htm \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\"], ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''</ref>\n\nAfter the period of initial military successes, the [[state-building]] process began. His leadership was demonstrated in all areas of state-building: military, administration, finance, economics and culture. Khmelnytsky made the [[Zaporozhian Host]] the supreme power in the new Ukrainian state and unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. Khmelnytsky built a new government system and developed military and civilian administration.\n\nA new generation of statesmen and military leaders came to the forefront: [[Ivan Vyhovsky]], [[Pavlo Teteria]], [[Danylo Nechai]] and [[Ivan Nechai]], [[Ivan Bohun]], [[Hryhoriy Hulyanytsky]]. From Cossack polkovnyks, officers, and military commanders, a new elite within the Cossack Hetman state was born. Throughout the years, the elite preserved and maintained the autonomy of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in the face of Russia's attempt to curb it. It was also instrumental in the onset of the period of [[Ruin (period of history)|Ruin]] that followed, eventually destroying most of the achievements of the Khmelnytsky era.\n\n===Complications===\n[[File:Bohdan-banner.jpg|thumb|Bohdan Khmelnytsky's banner that was taken at the [[battle of Berestechko]]. It was later taken by the Swedes in Warsaw 1655 and is now to be seen at Arm\u00e9museum, Stockholm, Sweden.]]\n\nKhmelnytsky's initial successes were followed by a series of setbacks as neither Khmelnytsky nor the Commonwealth had enough strength to stabilise the situation or to inflict a defeat on the enemy. What followed was a period of intermittent warfare and several peace treaties, which were seldom upheld. From spring 1649 onward, the situation turned for the worse for the Cossacks; as Polish attacks increased in frequency, they became more successful. The resulting [[Treaty of Zboriv]] on 18 August 1649 was unfavourable for the Cossacks. It was followed by another defeat at the [[battle of Berestechko]] on 18 June 1651 in which the Tatars betrayed Khmelnytsky and held the hetman captive. The Cossacks suffered a crushing defeat, with an estimated 30,000 casualties. They were forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]], which favoured the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Warfare broke open again and, in the years that followed, the two sides were almost perpetually at war. Now, the [[Crimean Tatars]] played a decisive role and did not allow either side to prevail. It was in their interests to keep both Ukraine and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth from getting too strong and becoming an effective power in the region.<ref name = \"Subtelny\">[[Orest Subtelny]]. ''Ukraine. A history.'' University of Toronto Press, p. 133. 1994. {{ISBN|0-8020-0591-8}}.</ref>\n\nKhmelnytsky started looking for another foreign ally. Although the Cossacks had established their ''[[de facto]]'' independence from Poland, the new state needed legitimacy, which could be provided by a foreign monarch. In search of a protectorate, Khmelnytsky approached the [[Ottoman sultan]] in 1651, and formal embassies were exchanged. The Turks offered vassalship, like their other arrangements with contemporary [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimea]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. However, the idea of a union with the Muslim monarch was not acceptable to the general populace and most Cossacks.\n\nThe other possible ally was the Orthodox [[tsar of Russia]]. That government remained quite cautious and stayed away from the hostilities in Ukraine. In spite of numerous envoys and calls for help from Khmelnytsky in the name of the shared Orthodox faith, the tsar preferred to wait, until the threat of a Cossack-Ottoman union in 1653 finally forced him to action.<ref name = \"Subtelny\" /> The idea that the tsar might be favourable to taking Ukraine under his hand was communicated to the hetman and so diplomatic activity intensified.\n\n==Treaty with tsar==\n{{Main|Treaty of Pereyaslav}}\n[[File:Alex K Bohdan Chmelnickyi prapor.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of Bohdan Khmelnytsky.

To finalize the treaty, a Russian embassy led by [[boyar]] [[Vasily Buturlin]] came to [[Pereyaslav]], where, on 18 January 1654, the Cossack Rada was called and the treaty concluded. Historians have not come to consensus in interpreting the intentions of the tsar and Khmelnytsky in signing this agreement. The treaty legitimized Russian claims to the capital of [[Kievan Rus']] and strengthened the tsar's influence in the region. Khmelnytsky needed the treaty to gain a legitimate monarch's protection and support from a friendly Orthodox power.\n\nHistorians have differed in their reading of Khmelnytsky's goal with the union: whether it was to be a military union, a [[suzerainty]], or a complete incorporation of Ukraine into the [[Tsardom of Russia]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\\P\\E\\PereiaslavTreatyof1654.htm \"Treaty of 1654\"], ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''</ref>\n\nThe differences were expressed during the ceremony of the oath of allegiance to the tsar: the Russian envoy refused to reciprocate with an oath from the ruler to his subjects, as the Cossacks and Ruthenians expected since it was the custom of the Polish king.\n\nKhmelnytsky stormed out of the church and threatened to cancel the entire treaty. The Cossacks decided to rescind the demand and abide by the treaty.\n\n==Final years==\nAs a result of the 1654 [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], the geopolitical map of the region changed. Russia entered the scene, and the Cossacks' former allies, the Tatars, had gone over to the Polish side and initiated warfare against Khmelnytsky. [[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] depopulated whole areas of Ukraine. Cossacks, aided by the Tsar's army, took revenge on Polish possessions in [[Belarus]], and in the spring of 1654, the Cossacks drove the Poles from much of the country. Sweden entered the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Old adversaries of both Poland and Russia, they occupied a share of Lithuania before the Russians could get there.\n\nThe occupation displeased Russia because the tsar sought to take over the Swedish Baltic provinces. In 1656, with the Commonwealth increasingly war-torn but also increasingly hostile and successful against the Swedes, the ruler of [[Transylvania]], [[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], also joined in. [[Charles X of Sweden]] had solicited his help because of the massive Polish popular opposition and resistance against the Swedes. Under blows from all sides, the Commonwealth barely survived.\n\n[[File:Subotiv Ukraine.png|thumb|left|Church of [[Subotiv]], [[Ukraine]], where Khmelnytsky was buried]]\n\nRussia attacked Sweden in July 1656, while its forces were deeply involved in Poland. That war ended in status quo two years later, but it complicated matters for Khmelnytsky, as his ally was now fighting his overlord. In addition to diplomatic tensions between the tsar and Khmelnytsky, a number of other disagreements between the two surfaced. In particular, they concerned Russian officials' interference in the finances of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and in the newly captured Belarus. The tsar concluded a separate treaty with the Poles in [[Vilnius]] in 1656. The Hetman's emissaries were not even allowed to attend the negotiations.\n\nKhmelnytsky wrote an irate letter to the tsar accusing him of breaking the Pereyaslav agreement. He compared the Swedes to the tsar and said that the former were more honourable and trustworthy than the Russians.<ref name = \"Subtelny\" />\n\nIn Poland, the Cossack army and Transylvanian allies suffered a number of setbacks. As a result, Khmelnytsky had to deal with a Cossack rebellion on the home front. Troubling news also came from Crimea, as Tatars, in alliance with Poland, were preparing for a new [[invasion]] of Ukraine. Though already ill, Khmelnytsky continued to conduct diplomatic activity, at one point even receiving the tsar's envoys from his bed.<ref name=\"SS591\">V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov.

In 1664 a Polish hetman [[Stefan Czarniecki]] recaptured Subotiv, which according to some Ukrainian historians, ordered the bodies of the hetman and his son, [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish]], to be exhumed and desecrated, while others claim that is not the case.<ref>Some Ukrainian historians dispute that his grave was desecrated. In 1973, an expedition investigated the site of the church and discovered remains of people, not been found before.</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nKhmelnytsky had a crucial influence on the history of Ukraine. He not only shaped the future of Ukraine but affected the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe, as the weakening of Poland-Lithuania was exploited by Austria, Saxony, Prussia, and Russia. His actions and role in events were viewed differently by different contemporaries, and even now there are greatly differing perspectives on his legacy.\n\n===Ukrainian assessment===\n[[File:5-Hryvnia-2005-front.jpg|thumb|A five [[Ukrainian hryvnia]] [[banknote]] depicting Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]\n[[File:Kiev khmelnitsky.jpg|thumb|The Khmelnytsky Monument in Kiev in 1905]]\n\nIn Ukraine, Khmelnytsky is generally regarded as a national hero.<ref name=\"Dalton2000\">{{cite book|last=Dalton|first=Meredith|title=Culture Shock!: Ukraine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGhaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56|year=2000|publisher=Graphics Arts Center|isbn=978-1-55868-420-1|page=56}}</ref><ref name=\"Steinlauf1997\">{{cite book|last=Steinlauf|first=Michael C.|authorlink=Michael C.

Although it survived the rebellion and the following attacks, within 100 years it was divided among Russia, [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]] in the [[partitions of Poland]].

Hiromichi Yahara]]\n\nThe Japanese land [[Military campaign|campaign]] (mainly [[defense (military)|defensive]]) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) [[regular army|regular]] [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|32nd Army]] and some 9,000 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 [[Conscription|drafted]] local [[Ryukyuan people]] (including 24,000 hastily drafted [[Rear (military)|rear]] [[militia]] called ''[[Boeitai]]'' and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). The Japanese had used ''[[kamikaze]]'' tactics since the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on April 1 and May 25, seven major ''kamikaze'' attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes.\n\nThe 32nd Army initially consisted of the [[9th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|9th]], [[24th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|24th]], and [[62nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|62nd]] Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] before the [[invasion]], resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lieutenant General [[Mitsuru Ushijima]], his [[chief of staff]], Lieutenant General [[Isamu Ch\u014d]] and his chief of operations, Colonel [[Hiromichi Yahara]]. Yahara advocated a defensive [[Military strategy|strategy]], whilst Ch\u014d advocated an [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] one.\n\nIn the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Minoru \u014cta]]. They expected the Americans to land 6\u201310 [[division (military)|divisions]] against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each US division five or six times the [[firepower]] of a Japanese division. To this, would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.\n\n===Military use of children===\nIn Okinawa island, [[middle school]] boys were organized into [[front line|front-line]]-service Tekketsu Kinn\u014dtai, while [[Himeyuri students]] were organized into a [[nurse|nursing]] unit.<ref name=command>Huber, Thomas M.{{cite web|url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |title=Japan's Battle of Okinawa, March\u2013June 1945 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214183638/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy}}, [[Command and General Staff College]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Japanese Imperial Army]] mobilized 1,780 [[middle school]] boys aged 14\u201317 years into front-line-service.

This mobilization was conducted by the ordinance of the Ministry of Army, not by law.\n\nThe ordinances mobilized the student as a volunteer soldier for form's sake. In reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to \"volunteer\" as soldiers. Sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents. About half of Tekketsu Kinn\u014dtai were killed, including in suicide bomb attacks against tanks, and in guerrilla operations.\n\nAfter losing the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands.

Nimitz]] to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, US naval forces began the campaign as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|US 5th Fleet]] under Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]], but ended it as the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[William Halsey]].\n\nJapanese air opposition had been relatively light during the first few days after the landings. However, on April 6, the expected air reaction began with an attack by 400 planes from [[Kyushu]]. Periodic heavy air attacks continued through April. During the period March 26&nbsp;\u2013 April 30, twenty American ships were sunk and 157 damaged by enemy action. For their part, by April 30, the Japanese had lost more than 1,100 planes to Allied naval forces alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 102|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBetween April 6 and June 22, the Japanese flew 1,465 ''kamikaze'' aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from [[Formosa]]. While US intelligence estimated there were 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese actually had about 700, dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the US [[Fifth Air Force]] disputed Navy claims of ''kamikaze'' coming from Formosa.<ref>Baldwin, Hanson W.

While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based [[Shin'y\u014d-class suicide motorboat]]s were also used in the Japanese [[suicide attack]]s, although Ushijima had disbanded the majority of the suicide boat battalions prior to the battle due to expected low effectiveness against a superior enemy. The boat crews were re-formed into three additional infantry battalions.<ref>Christopher Chant, \"The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II (Routledge Revivals)\", p. 87</ref>\n\n===Operation ''Ten-Go''===\n{{Main|Operation Ten-Go}}\n[[File:Yamato battleship explosion.jpg|thumb|The super battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} explodes after persistent attacks from US aircraft.]]\n\nOperation ''Ten-Go'' (''Ten-g\u014d sakusen'') was the attempted attack by a strike force of 10 Japanese surface vessels, led by the {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and commanded by [[List of Imperial Japanese Navy admirals|Admiral]] [[Seiichi It\u014d]]. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach ''Yamato'' and fight from shore, using her guns as [[coastal artillery]] and her crew as [[naval infantry]]. The ''Ten-Go'' force was spotted by [[submarine]]s shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was intercepted by US carrier aircraft.\n\nUnder attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on April 7, 1945, after a one-sided battle, long before she could reach Okinawa. (US [[torpedo bomber]]s were instructed to aim for only one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and to aim for the bow or the stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest.) Of ''Yamato''{{'}}s screening force, the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi|1942|2}} and 4 of the 8 destroyers were also sunk. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Admiral It\u014d, at the cost of 10 US aircraft and 12 airmen.\n\n===British Pacific Fleet===\n[[File:HMS Formidable (67) on fire 1945.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Formidable|67|6}} on fire after a ''[[kamikaze]]'' attack on May 4.

The force withdrew to [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] on April 23.\n\nOn May 1, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval [[bombardment]] as well as aircraft. Several ''kamikaze'' attacks caused significant damage, but since the British had armored [[flight deck]]s on their aircraft carriers, they experienced only a brief interruption to their force's operations.<ref>{{harvnb|Hastings|2007|p=401}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hobbs|2012|pp=175\u201376}}</ref>\n\n==Land battle==\n{{more citations needed|section |date=December 2016}}\n[[File:New Mexico class battleship bombarding Okinawa.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|6}} shelling Okinawa on April 1, 1945]]\n\nThe land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on April 1, 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed in the [[Kerama Islands]], {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Okinawa on March 26. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.\n\nOn March 31, Marines of the [[Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion]] landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Okinawan capital of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]].

In light of the weak opposition, General Buckner decided to proceed immediately with Phase II of his plan\u2014the seizure of northern Okinawa. The [[6th Marine Division]] headed up the [[Ishikawa Isthmus]] and by April 7, had sealed off the [[Motobu Peninsula]].\n\nSix days later on April 13, the 2nd Battalion, [[22nd Marine Regiment]], reached Hedo Point ([[Hedo-misaki]]) at the northernmost tip of the island. By this point, the bulk of the Japanese forces in the north (codenamed ''Udo Force'') were cornered on the Motobu Peninsula. Here, the terrain was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on [[Yae-Dake]], a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the center of the peninsula. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared Yae-Dake on April 18. However, this was not the end of ground combat in northern Okinawa. On May 24, the Japanese mounted \"Operation ''Gi-gou''\": a company of ''[[Giretsu Kuteitai]]'' commandos were airlifted in a suicide attack on Yomitan. They destroyed {{convert|70000|USgal|l}} of fuel and nine planes before being killed by the defenders, who lost two men.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] assaulted Ie Island ([[Ie Shima]])\u2014a small island off the western end of the peninsula\u2014on April 16. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered ''kamikaze'' attacks, and even local women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before the area was declared secured on April 21, and became another air base for operations against Japan.\n\n===Southern Okinawa===\n[[File:OkinawaMarinesDeadJapanese.jpg|thumb|US Marines pass a dead Japanese soldier in a destroyed village, April 1945.]]\n[[File:OkinawaMarineCaveDemolition.jpg|thumb|A [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]] demolition crew watches explosive charges detonate and destroy a Japanese cave, May 1945.]]\n[[File:Americans on Okinawa hear of victory in Europe.jpg|thumb|American soldiers of the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] listen impassively to radio reports of [[Victory in Europe Day]] on May 8, 1945.]]\n\nWhile the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the US Army 96th and 7th Infantry Divisions wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as [[Cactus Ridge]]. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed \"[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]\").<!--Former edit specified that the 6th Marine Division was heading south after the XXIV corps was done clearing the north (wrong). 2nd Marine Division were not introduced until later in the campaign--> By the night of April 8, American troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese. Yet the battle had only begun, for it was now realized that \"these were merely outposts,\" guarding the Shuri Line.\n\nThe next American objective was [[Kakazu Ridge]], two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. American forces often lost personnel before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to obtain water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable, but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.\n\nAs the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Lieutenant General Ushijima \u2014 influenced by General Ch\u014d \u2014 decided to take the offensive. On the evening of April 12, the 32nd Army attacked American positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce [[close combat]], the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on April 14 was again repulsed. The effort led the 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night [[infiltration tactics]], but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.\n\nThe 27th Infantry Division\u2014which had landed on April 9\u2014took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General [[John R. Hodge]] now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th to the east, with each division holding a front of only about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Hodge launched a new offensive of April 19 with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean Theater]]. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with [[napalm]], rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on [[reverse slope defence|reverse slopes]], where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.\n\nA tank assault to achieve [[breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] by outflanking Kakazu Ridge failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge, and therefore failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although [[flame tank]]s cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps suffered 720 casualties. The losses might have been greater except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.\n\nAt the end of April, after Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line,<ref>West Point Atlas of American Wars</ref> the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 96th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, the III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and the 10th Army assumed control of the battle.\n\n[[File:US Flag raised over Shuri castle on Okinawa.jpg|thumb|upright|Lt.

This time, Ushijima attempted to make [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assaults]] on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support, but effective American [[counter-battery fire]] destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack failed.\n\nBuckner launched another American attack on May 11. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On May 13, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and [[763rd Tank Battalion (United States)|763rd Tank Battalion]] captured Conical Hill. Rising {{convert|476|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions fought for \"Sugar Loaf Hill\". The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.\n\nBy the end of May, monsoon rains which had turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the [[Military tactics|tactical]] and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a [[World War I]] battlefield, as troops became mired in mud, and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese and American bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew.

The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 personnel into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia, with approximately 4,000 holed up at the underground headquarters on the hillside overlooking the Okinawa Naval Base in the Oroku Peninsula, east of the airfield.\n\nOn June 4, elements of the 6th Marine Division launched an amphibious assault on the peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors, including Admiral [[Minoru \u014cta]], all committed suicide within the hand-built tunnels of the underground naval headquarters on June 13. By June 17, the remnants of Ushijima's shattered 32nd Army were pushed into a small pocket in the far south of the island to the southeast of [[Itoman]].\n\nOn June 18, General Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire while monitoring the progress of his troops from a forward observation post.

This, coupled with thousands of bodies both friend and foe littering the entire island, created a scent you could nearly taste. [[Morale]] was dangerously low by the month of May and the state of discipline on a moral basis had a new low barometer for acceptable behavior. The ruthless atrocities by the Japanese throughout the war had already brought on an altered behavior (deemed so by traditional standards) by many Americans resulting in [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead|the desecration of Japanese remains]], but the Japanese tactic of using the Okinawan people as [[human shield]]s brought about a new aspect of terror and torment to the psychological capacity of the Americans.<ref name=mcg>{{cite web|author=SSgt Rudy R.

These interventions were meant to put an end to [[liberalization]] efforts and uprisings that had the potential to compromise Soviet [[hegemony]] inside the [[Eastern Bloc]], which was considered by the [[Soviet Union]] to be an essential defensive and strategic buffer in case hostilities with [[NATO]] were to break out.\n\nIn practice, the policy meant that only limited independence of the [[satellite state]]s' communist parties was allowed and that no [[socialist country]] would be allowed to compromise the cohesiveness of the Eastern Bloc in any way.  That is, no country could leave the [[Warsaw Pact]] or disturb a ruling [[communist party]]'s monopoly on power. Implicit in this doctrine was that the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]] reserved, for itself, the power to define \"[[socialism]]\" and \"[[capitalism]]\". Following the announcement of the Brezhnev Doctrine, numerous treaties were signed between the Soviet Union and its satellite states to reassert these points and to further ensure inter-state cooperation. The principles of the doctrine were so broad that the Soviets even used it to justify their [[Soviet-Afghan War|military intervention]] in the non-Warsaw Pact nation of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 1979. The Brezhnev Doctrine stayed in effect until it was ended with the [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u201381|Soviet reaction]] to the [[Polish crisis of 1980\u20131981]].<ref>Wilfried Loth.

This denouncement of the former leader led to a period of the Soviet Era known commonly as \u201cDe-Stalinization.\u201d Under the blanket reforms of this process, [[Imre Nagy]] came to power in Hungary as the new Prime Minister, taking over for [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]]. Almost immediately Nagy set out on a path of reform. Police power was reduced, collectivized farms were breaking apart, industry and food production shifted and religious tolerance was becoming more prominent. These reforms shocked the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]. Nagy was quickly overthrown by R\u00e1kosi in 1955, and stripped of his political livelihood. Shortly after this coup, Khrushchev signed the [[Belgrade declaration|Belgrade Declaration]] which stated \u201cseparate paths to socialism were permissible within the Soviet Bloc.\u201d<ref name=\"Ouimet 2003 10\u201311\">{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> With hopes for serious reform just having been extinguished in Hungary, this declaration was not received well by the Hungarians.<ref name=\"Ouimet 2003 10\u201311\"/> Tensions quickly mounted in Hungary with demonstrations and calls for not only the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but for a Hungarian withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]] as well. By October 23 Soviet forces landed in Budapest. A chaotic and bloody squashing of revolutionary forces lasted from the October 24 until November 7.<ref>Matthew Ouimet, (2003) ''The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. pp. 9-16 {{ISBN|0-8078-2740-1}}</ref> Although order was restored, tensions remained on both sides of the conflict. Hungarians resented the end of the reformation, and the Soviets wanted to avoid a similar crisis from occurring again anywhere in the socialist camp.\n\n=== A Peaceful Brezhnev Doctrine ===\nWhen the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] ended, the Soviets adopted the mindset that governments supporting both [[Communism]] and [[Capitalism]] must coexist, and more importantly, build relations. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] called for a [[peaceful coexistence]], where the war between the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] would come to a close. This ideal, further stressed that all people are equal, and own the right to solve the problems of their own countries themselves. The idea was that in order for both states to peacefully coexist, neither country can exercise the right to get involved in each other's internal affairs. The Soviets did not want the Americans getting into their business, as the Americans did not want the Soviets in theirs. While this idea was brought up following the events of [[Hungary]], they were not put into effect for a great deal of time. This is further explained in the '''Renouncement''' section.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Law and the Use of Force by States:  The Brezhnev Doctrine|last=Rostow|first=Nicholas|publisher=Yale Journal of International Law|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=209\u2013243}}</ref>\n\n=== 1968 Prague Spring ===\n\nNotions of reform had been slowly growing in Czechoslovakia since the early-mid 1960s. However, once the Stalinist President [[Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd]] resigned as head of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Communist Party]] in January 1968, the [[Prague Spring]] began to take shape. [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]] replaced Novotn\u00fd as head of the party, initially thought a friend to the Soviet Union. It was not long before Dub\u010dek began making serious liberal reforms. In an effort to establish what Dub\u010dek called \"[[Socialism with a human face|developed socialism]]\", he instituted changes in Czechoslovakia to create a much more free and liberal version of the socialist state.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Suri|first=Jeremi|date=2006-01-01|title=The Promise and Failure of 'Developed Socialism': The Soviet 'Thaw' and the Crucible of the Prague Spring, 1964\u20131972|jstor=20081303|journal=Contemporary European History|volume=15|issue=2|pages=145\u2013146}}</ref> Aspects of a market economy were implemented, travel abroad became easier for citizens, state censorship loosened, the power of the secret police was limited, and steps were taken to improve relations with the west. As the reforms piled up, the Kremlin quickly grew uneasy as they hoped to not only preserve socialism within Czechoslovakia, but to avoid another Hungarian-style crisis as well. Soviet panic compounded in March of \u201968 when student protests erupted in Poland and Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd resigned as the Czechoslovak President. March 21 [[Yuri Andropov]], the KGB Chairman, issued a grave statement concerning the reforms taking place under Dub\u010dek. \"The methods and forms by which the work is progressing in Czechoslovakia remind one very much of Hungary. In this outward appearance of chaos\u2026there is a certain order. It all began like this in Hungary also, but then came the first and second echelons, and then, finally the social democrats.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\n[[Ben Ginsburg-Hix]] sought clarification from Dub\u010dek on March 21, with the Politburo convened, on the situation in Czechoslovakia. Eager to avoid a similar fate as Imre Nagy, Dub\u010dek reassured Brezhnev that the reforms were totally under control and not on a similar path to those seen in 1956 in Hungary.<ref name=\":1\" /> Despite Dub\u010dek's assurances, other socialist allies grew uneasy by the reforms taking place in an Eastern European neighbor. Namely, the Ukrainians were very alarmed by the Czechoslovak deviation from standard socialism. The First Secretary of the [[Ukrainian Communist Party]] called on Moscow for an immediate invasion of Czechoslovakia in order to stop Dub\u010dek's \"socialism with a human face\" from spreading into Ukraine and sparking unrest.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> By May 6 Brezhnev condemned Dub\u010dek's system, declaring it a step toward \"the complete collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]].\"<ref name=\":2\" /> After three months of negotiations, agreements, and rising tensions between Moscow and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion began on the night of August 20, 1968 which was to be met with great Czechoslovak discontent and resistance for many months into 1970.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Formation of the Doctrine ===\nBrezhnev realized the need for a shift from [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s idea of \"different paths to socialism\" towards one that fostered a more unified vision throughout the socialist camp.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=60\u201361}}</ref> \"Economic integration, political consolidation, a return to ideological orthodoxy, and inter-Party cooperation became the new watchwords of Soviet bloc relations.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=65}}</ref> On November 12, 1968 Brezhnev stated that \"[w]hen external and internal forces hostile to socialism try to turn the development of a given socialist country in the direction of \u2026 the capitalist system ... this is no longer merely a problem for that country's people, but a common problem, the concern of all socialist countries.\" Brezhnev's statement at the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers Party]] effectively classified the issue of sovereignty as less important than the preservation of international socialism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=67}}</ref> While no new doctrine had been officially announced, it was clear that Soviet intervention was imminent if Moscow perceived any country to be at risk of jeopardizing the integrity of socialism.\n\n=== Brezhnev Doctrine in practice ===\nThe vague, broad nature of the Brezhnev Doctrine allowed application to any international situation the USSR saw fit. This is clearly evident not only through the Prague Spring in 1968, and the indirect pressure on Poland from 1980\u201381, but also in the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan starting in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=88\u201397}}</ref> Any instance which caused the USSR to question whether or not a country was becoming a risk to international socialism, the use of military intervention was, in Soviet eyes, not only justified, but necessary.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy|last=Ouimet|first=Matthew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8078-2740-1|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n\n=== Afghanistan, 1979 ===\nThe Soviet government's desire to link its foreign policy to the Brezhnev Doctrine was evoked again when it ordered a military intervention in [[Afghanistan]] in 1979. This was perhaps the last chapter of this doctrine's saga. The political uneasiness in Afghanistan at the time made it the perfect target for intervention. Strategically, it was in the Soviets\u2019 best interests to make their way to Afghanistan if they wanted to expand their communist influence even further.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn April of that year, Afghanistan had two political groups facing deep struggle in efforts to get along with one another. It was this notion that provided [[Moscow]] a soviet government in Afghanistan. Two groups that worked together as a part of this process were known as [[Khalq]] and [[Parcham]]. The Khalq in particular, held communist ideologies. In the fight for power, the communist Khalq became the leading force in the Afghanistan homeland, with Parcham getting pushed out of the equation in a falling-out. Along with Parcham, their leader, [[Babrak Karmal]] was sent away. He did so to fill as the ambassador for the government in relations with eastern Europe. This was a huge victory for the Soviets, because they now had infrastructural power in Afghanistan. Islamic fundamentalists took issue with the Communist party taking charge. In result, they attempted to overthrow the Khalq leader, [[Hafizullah Amin]]. However, the fundamentalists\u2019 leader, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], died instead. This was just one side effect of the failure of the fundamentalists\u2019 rebellion.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nExploiting this turmoil, the Soviets, on December 27, 1979, had somewhere around 5,000 troops in Afghanistan. During his talks with the Soviets during his time as Ambassador, Karmal coordinated with the Soviet government. It was this coordination that led to both Soviet soldiers and airborne units attacking the Amin-lead Afghanistan government. In light of this attack, Amin ended up dead. The Soviets took it upon themselves to place their ally, former-Ambassador Babrak Karmal as the new lead of the government in Afghanistan.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe Soviet Union, once again, fell back to the Brezhnev Doctrine for rationale, claiming that it was both morally and politically justified. The Soviets also begged that it was out of protection of their Southern border. It was also explained by the Soviets that they owed help to their friend and ally Babrak Karmal. While the real reason seems to be for the sake of their own expansion, the world will never really know their exact intentions.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Renunciation ===\nThe long lasting struggle of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] made the Soviets realize that their reach and influence was in fact limited. \"[The war in Afghanistan] had shown that socialist internationalism and Soviet national interests were not always compatible.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Tensions between the USSR and Czechoslovakia since 1968, as well as Poland in 1980, proved the inefficiencies inherent in the Brezhnev Doctrine. Although the Soviet Union wanted to preserve socialism in its allies, sometimes that proved easier said than done. Gorbachev's Glasnost and Perestroika finally opened the door for Soviet Bloc countries and republics to make reforms without Soviet intervention.\n\nOn May 29, 1972, it was implied in an agreement between [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]], that the Brezhnev Doctrine was to be repealed from the Soviets' agenda. This was made possible because the Doctrine allegedly violated the sovereign equality of the socialist states that they were trying to manage. As the meeting between both political figures went on, the USSR accepted the agreement believing that the United States was planning to repeal the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. This section of the [[Moscow Declarations]], explained that as long as one country remained in accordance with the removal of their own explorational doctrine, then the other must abide as well. However, if that agreement was infringed upon, then the other country withheld the right to come back to their own doctrine, and enforce it as such. This was a sigh of relief for both the [[Middle East]] and other regions that fell victim to the Brezhnev Doctrine, and [[Latin America]]. Latin Americans rejoiced as that meant they were free of situations like the incident that happened in the Dominican Republic.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book |title=The Brezhnev Doctrine Repealed and Peaceful Co-Existence Enacted|last=Schwebel|first=Stephen M.|publisher=American Journal of International Law|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=816\u2013819}}</ref>\n\nThe ultimate goal of this renouncement of both doctrines was to enact the idea of [[peaceful coexistence]]. However, the United States time and again had shown that while they agreed to the idea, they fled from any scenario that dealt with it. Brezhnev believed that while they were trying to exist peacefully together, it would not be possible. He was a firm believer that the two opposing ideas from both countries on matters such as social class would never mesh. Despite that thinking, the Soviet Union strongly pushed for the idea of peaceful coexistence to become a part of the [[United Nations Charter]]. The United States continually insisted that this notion should not be allowed to happen. Many critics of this political behavior believe this to be one of the United States' most stubborn actions of [[Cold War]] time.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Post-Brezhnev Doctrine ===\nWith the agreement to terminate the Brezhnev Doctrine, later came on a new leader for the Soviets, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The foreign policies of his [[Soviet-Russia]], were much more relaxed. This is most likely due to the fact that Brezhnev Doctrine was no longer at the disposal of the Soviet Union. This had a major effect on the way that the Soviets carried out their new mentality when dealing with countries they once tried to control. This was best captured by Gorbachev's involvement with a group by the name of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). This organization lessens the control that the Soviet's had on all other partners of the agreement. This notion provided other countries that were once oppressed under communist intervention, to go about their own [[political reform]]. This actually carried over internally as well. In fact, the [[Soviet Union]]'s biggest problem after the removal of the Brezhnev Doctrine, was the [[Khrushchev]] Dilemma. This did not address how to stop internal political reform, but how to tame the physical violence that comes along with it. It had become clear that the Soviet Union was beginning to loosen up.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Brezhnev Doctrine: A New Era in Soviet-East European Relations?|last=Kramer|first=Mark|publisher=International Security|year=1989\u20131990|isbn=|location=|pages=25\u201327}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to pinpoint the renouncement of the Brezhnev Doctrine as to what started the end for the Soviet Union. Countries that were once micromanaged now could do what they wanted to politically, because the Soviets could no longer try to conquer where they saw fit. With that, the Soviet Union began to collapse. While the communist agenda had caused infinite problems for other countries, it was the driving force behind the Soviet Union staying together. After all, it seems that the removal of the incentive to conquer, and forcing of communism upon other nations, defeated the one thing Soviet Russia had always been about, the expansion of Communism.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nWith the fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine, came the fall of the man, Brezhnev himself, the share of power in the [[Warsaw Pact]], and perhaps the final moment for the Soviet Union, the [[Berlin Wall]]. The Brezhnev Doctrine coming to a close, was perhaps the beginning of the end for one of the strongest empires in the world's history, the Soviet Union.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== In other Socialist countries ===\nThe Soviet Union was not the only Socialist country to intervene militarily in fellow Socialist countries. Vietnam deposed the [[Khmer Rogue]] in the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] of 1978, which was followed by a revenge Chinese invasion of Vietnam in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] of 1979.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\n=== Brezhnev Doctrine as a UN violation ===\nThis doctrine was even furthermore a problem in the view of the [[United Nations]]. The UN's first problem was that it permits use of force. This is a clear violation of Article 2, Chapter 4 of the [[United Nations Charter]] which states, \u201cAll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\u201d When international law conflicts with the Charter, the Charter has precedent. It is this, that makes the Brezhnev Doctrine illegal.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Brezhnev Doctrine|last=Glazer|first=Stephen G,|publisher=The International Lawyer|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=169\u2013179}}</ref>\n\n=== Brezhnev Doctrine vs. Monroe Doctrine===\nThe Brezhnev Doctrine is essentially a Soviet version of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. This perhaps is best exemplified by a connection between American intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965 and the invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] by the Soviets in 1968. Both events are extremely similar in the fact that they used a set of doctrines to justify their actions.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikisourcepar2|Brezhnev Doctrine|Text of Brezhnev's speech}}\n*[[Truman Doctrine]]\n*[[Johnson Doctrine]]\n*[[Domino theory]]\n*[[Cold War]]\n*[[Gladio]]\n*[[Ulbricht Doctrine]]\n*[[Reagan Doctrine]]\n*[[Soviet occupations]]\n*[[Sinatra Doctrine]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Ouimet, Matthew: ''The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy.''

A bain-marie is also used to melt ingredients for cooking.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Can-in-can steaming.svg|thumb|Schematic of an improvised double boiler, as used in outdoor cooking]]\n\nThe double boiler comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts:  a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working fluid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath.  Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source.\n\nTypically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working fluid.\n\nThe smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container filled with the working fluid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed.  The constant boiling temperature of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching.\n\nWhen the working fluid is water and the bain-marie is used at [[sea level]], the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (212&nbsp;\u00b0F), the boiling point of water at sea level.  Using different working fluids, for example, oil, in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures.\n\n== Alternatives ==\nA contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric \"dry-heat\" bain-marie, [[heating element|heated by elements]] below both pots.  The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions.  They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts.\n\nElectric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or \"bath\"), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam.\n\n== Culinary applications ==\nIn cooking applications, a bain-marie usually consists of a pan of water in which another container or containers of food to be cooked is placed within the pan of water.<ref name=\"Beck 2013 p. 441\">{{cite book | last=Beck | first=S. | title=Simca's Cuisine | publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-8041-5047-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=watRAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT441 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=441}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fondant au chocolat (250g de beurre) - Bain-marie au four.jpg|thumb|An improvised bain-marie being used to melt chocolate.]]\n* [[Chocolate]] can be melted in a bain-marie to avoid splitting and caking onto the pot. Special [[dessert]] bains-marie have a thermally insulated container and are used as a chocolate [[fondue]].\n* [[Cheesecake]] is often baked in a bain-marie to prevent the top from cracking in the centre.\n* [[Custard]] may be cooked in a bain-marie to keep a crust from forming on the outside of the custard before the interior is fully cooked.  In the case of the [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]], placing the ramekins in a roasting pan and filling the pan with hot water until it is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the sides of the ramekins transfers the heat to the custard gently, which prevents the custard from curdling. The humidity from the steam that rises as the water heats helps keep the top of the custard from becoming too dry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drgourmet.com/techniques/bainmarie.shtml|title=Techniques: Bain Marie|publisher=DrGourmet.com|accessdate=2011-07-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604142734/http://www.drgourmet.com/techniques/bainmarie.shtml| archivedate= 4 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n* Classic warm sauces, such as [[Hollandaise]] and [[beurre blanc]], requiring heat to emulsify the mixture but not enough to [[curdle]] or \"split\" the sauce, are often cooked using a bain-marie.\n* Some [[charcuterie]] such as [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s and [[p\u00e2t\u00e9s]] are cooked in an \"oven-type\" bain-marie.\n* [[reduction (cooking)|Thickening]] of [[condensed milk]], such as in [[confection]]-making, is done easily in a bain-marie.\n* Controlled-temperature bains-marie can be used to heat frozen [[breast milk]] before feedings.\n* Bains-marie can be used in place of [[chafing dish]]es for keeping foods warm for long periods of time, where stovetops or [[hot plate]]s are inconvenient or too powerful.\n* A bain-marie can be used to re-liquefy hardened honey by placing a glass jar on top of any improvised platform sitting at the bottom of a pot of gently boiling water.\n\n== Other uses ==\nIn small scale soap-making, a bain-marie's inherent control over maximum temperature makes it optimal for liquefying [[melt-and-pour soap]] bases prior to molding them into bars. It offers the advantage of maintaining the base in a liquid state, or reliquefying a solidified base, with minimal deterioration. Similarly, using a water bath, traditional wood glue can be melted and kept in a stable liquid state over many hours without damage to the animal proteins it incorporates.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Mary's Bath 1528 detail AQ9 (1).tif|upright|thumb|An alchemical ''balneum Mariae'' from ''Coelum philosophorum'', Philip Ulstad, 1528, [[Science History Institute]] ]] \n\nThe name comes from the medieval-[[Latin]] term ''balneum'' (or ''balineum'') ''Mariae''\u2014literally, ''Mary's bath''\u2014from which the [[French language|French]] ''bain de Marie'', or ''bain-marie'', is derived.

It is a [[natural region]] mostly contained in the [[province of Nuoro]] and located alongside the [[Gennargentu]] massif.\n\nThe name comes from [[Cicero]], who described it as a land of [[barbarians]] (''Barbaria'', \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 in [[Ancient Greek]]). This word derives from the Greek \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"stuttering\". The inhabitants were also known, by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], with the pejorative term  ''latrones mastrucati'', which means \"thieves with a rough garment in wool\". Roman domination in this area of Sardinia was never more than nominal.\n\nIn 594, Pope [[Gregory the Great]] wrote a letter to [[Hospito]], a Christian whom he calls the \"leader of the Barbaricini\" (''dux barbaricinorum''). Hospito apparently permitted the evangelisation of pagan Barbagia by Christian missionaries.\n\nThe area is usually divided into four Barbagias: the Barbagia di [[Ollolai]], the [[Barbagia di Seulo]], the [[Barbagia di Belv\u00ec]] and the [[Mandrolisai]]. The latter is named after a sub-region, and the others after their main villages.\n\nThe area is full of hard hills, and there is little human presence. Barbagia is one of the least populated areas in Europe, which has allowed Barbagia to preserve its cultural and natural treasures. Barbagia is one of the few, if not the only Sardinian region, where [[Sardinian language]] and its internal varieties (both [[Logudorese dialect|Nuorese]] and [[Campidanese dialect|Campidanese]] dialects) is still spoken on an everyday basis, while the rest of the island has already undergone [[language shift|shift]] to Italian.\n\nOne of the most important villages is [[Gavoi]].

Founded in 1960 by two Australians, driver [[Jack Brabham]] and designer [[Ron Tauranac]], the team won four [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers']] and two [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors']] World Championships in its 30-year Formula One history. Jack Brabham's 1966 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Drivers' Championship remains the only such achievement using a car bearing the driver's own name.\n\nIn the 1960s, Brabham was the world's largest manufacturer of [[open wheel car|open-wheel racing cars]] for sale to customer teams; by 1970 it had built more than 500 cars. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in [[Formula Two]] and [[Formula Three]]. Brabham cars also competed in the [[Indianapolis 500]] and in [[Formula 5000]] racing. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced such innovations  as in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and [[hydropneumatic suspension]].  Its unique [[Gordon Murray]]-designed \"[[fan car]]\"  won its only race before being withdrawn.\n\nThe team won two more Formula One Drivers' Championships in the 1980s with Brazilian [[Nelson Piquet]]. He won his first championship in {{f1|1981}} in the [[ground effect (cars)|ground effects]] [[Brabham BT49|BT49]]-[[Cosworth DFV|Ford]], and became the first to win a Drivers' Championship with a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] car, in {{f1|1983}}. In 1983 the [[Brabham BT52]], driven by Piquet and Italian [[Riccardo Patrese]], was powered by the [[BMW M12]] [[straight-4]] engine, and powered Brabham to four of the team's 35 Grand Prix victories.\n\nBritish businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]] owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the [[1992 Formula One season|1992 season]], the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]]. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the [[2010 Formula One season]] using the Brabham name.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:BrabhamJack1966B.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jack Brabham]] was 40 when he won the F1 drivers' title in a Brabham car]]\nThe Brabham team was founded by [[Jack Brabham]] and [[Ron Tauranac]], who met in 1951 while both were successfully building and racing cars in their native Australia. Brabham was the more successful driver and went to the United Kingdom in 1955 to further his racing career. There he started driving for the [[Cooper Car Company]] works team and by 1958 had progressed with them to Formula One, the highest category of [[open-wheel racing]] defined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), motor sport's world governing body.<ref>\"FIA\" has been used throughout this article to refer to the motor sports governing body. Until 1978 motor sport was governed directly by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) and from 1978 by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), both subsidiary bodies of the FIA. In 1992 the FIA subsumed FISA and its governing role.</ref> In [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]], Brabham won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in Cooper's revolutionary [[mid-engine]]d cars.<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 17\u201319</ref>\n\nDespite their innovation of putting the engine behind the driver, the Coopers and their chief designer, [[Owen Maddock]], were generally resistant to developing their cars. Brabham pushed for further advances, and played a significant role in developing Cooper's highly successful 1960 T53 \"lowline\" car, with input from his friend Tauranac.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 18, 22. Brabham had consulted Tauranac by letter on technical matters since arriving in the UK. He used a gear cluster designed by Tauranac for several years and Tauranac also advised on the suspension geometry of the Cooper T53 \"lowline\" car.</ref> Brabham was confident he could do better than Cooper, and in late 1959 he asked Tauranac to come to the UK and work with him, initially producing upgrade kits for [[Sunbeam Rapier]] and [[Triumph Herald]] road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 22\u20134. Jack had already tried to buy Cooper in association with fellow-driver [[Roy Salvadori]]</ref> Brabham describes Tauranac as \"absolutely the only bloke I'd have gone into partnership with\".<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 140</ref> Later, Brabham offered a Coventry-Climax FWE-engined version of the Herald, with {{convert|83|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and uprated suspension to match the extra power.<ref name=IMSblunsden>{{cite magazine|title=Brabhams \"lilla bomb\"!: Triumph-Herald-Climax|trans-title=Branham's \"little bomb\"!|pages=12\u201313|language=Swedish|last=Blunsden|first=John|location=Lerum, Sweden|magazine=Illustrerad Motor Sport|number=1\u20132|date=February\u2013March 1962}}</ref>\n\nTo meet that aim, Brabham and Tauranac set up Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), deliberately avoiding the use of either man's name. The new company would compete with Cooper in the market for customer racing cars. As Brabham was still employed by Cooper, Tauranac produced the first MRD car, for the entry level [[Formula Junior]] class, in secrecy. Unveiled in the summer of 1961, the \"MRD\" was soon renamed. Motoring journalist [[G\u00e9rard Crombac|Jabby Crombac]] pointed out that \"[the] way a Frenchman pronounces those initials\u2014written phonetically, 'em air day'\u2014sounded perilously like the French word... ''[[Wiktionary:merde|merde]].''\"<ref>Scarlett (May 2006) p. 43. Although compare pronunciation with the related verb [[wiktionary:emmerder|emmerder]]. This is the story as recalled by both Ron Tauranac and Brabham mechanic Michael Scarlett. The British journalist Alan Brinton has also been credited with pointing out this unfortunate fact to Brabham. See Drackett (1985) p. 21.</ref> Gavin Youl achieved a second-place finish at Goodwood and another at [[Mallory Park]] in the MRD-Ford.<ref name=IMS162>{{cite magazine|title=Jack Brabham: VM-kandidat p\u00e5 egen hand?|trans-title=Championship candidate on his own?|page=11|language=Swedish|last=Johansson|first=Lars-Erik|location=Lerum, Sweden|magazine=Illustrerad Motor Sport|number=1\u20132|date=February\u2013March 1962}}</ref> The cars were subsequently known as Brabhams, with type numbers starting with BT for \"Brabham Tauranac\".<ref>Drackett (1985) p. 21. The first prototype FJunior car therefore became the BT1 and its production version the BT2.</ref>\n\nBy the [[1961 Formula One season]], the [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] teams had developed the mid-engined approach further than Cooper. Brabham had a poor season, scoring only four points, and\u2014having run his own private Coopers in non-championship events during 1961\u2014left the company in 1962 to drive for his own team: the Brabham Racing Organisation, using cars built by Motor Racing Developments.<ref name=\"Law31\">Lawrence (1999) p. 31</ref><ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) pp. 14, 145\u20139.

The Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) started the year fielding a customer [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] chassis, which was delivered at 3:00 am in order to keep it a secret.<ref name=IMS162/> Brabham took two points finishes in Lotuses, before the turquoise-[[livery|liveried]] Brabham BT3 car made its debut at the [[1962 German Grand Prix]]. It retired with a [[throttle]] problem after 9 of the 15 laps, but went on to take a pair of fourth places at the end of the season.<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 21\u201322. Brabham bought a new spaceframe Lotus 24, but had to use a 1961-vintage Lotus 21 in the early races after a workshop fire. Team Lotus reserved the monocoque Lotus 25 for their own use that season.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brabham BT3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Brabham BT3]], the first Brabham Formula One design]]\nFrom the [[1963 Formula One season|1963 season]], Brabham was partnered by American driver [[Dan Gurney]], the pair now running in Australia's [[List of international auto racing colors|racing colours]] of green and gold.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 147</ref> Brabham took the team's first win at the non-championship [[Solituderennen|Solitude Grand Prix]] in 1963.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 28</ref> Gurney took the [[marque]]'s first two wins in the world championship, at the 1964 [[1964 French Grand Prix|French]] and [[1964 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican]] Grands Prix. Brabham works and customer cars took another three non-championship wins during the [[1964 Formula One season|1964 season]].<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 35\u201341</ref> The [[1965 Formula One season|1965 season]] was less successful, with no championship wins. Brabham finished third or fourth in the Constructors' Championship for three years running, but poor reliability marred promising performances on several occasions. Motor sport authors Mike Lawrence and David Hodges have said that a lack of resources may have cost the team results, a view echoed by Tauranac.<ref>Tauranac says (Lawrence (1999) p. 48) that he feels a third mechanic would have reduced the reliability problems. Lawrence himself notes (Lawrence (1999) p. 71) that \"If only Jack had been prepared to spend a little more money, the results could have been so much better.\" Hodges (1990) p. 32 notes \"Economy was a watchword. (...) It was this attitude, perhaps, which cost [Brabham] some races.\"</ref>\n\nThe FIA doubled the Formula One engine capacity limit to 3&nbsp;litres for the [[1966 Formula One season|1966 season]] and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm [[Repco]], which had never produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 [[engine block]]s from the defunct American [[Oldsmobile]] F85 road car project, and other off-the-shelf parts.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 51\u201352</ref> Consulting and design engineer [[Phil Irving]] (of [[Vincent Motorcycle]] fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive,<ref>Unique p. 43. The team was the only one not contracted by [[John Frankenheimer]] for the shooting of the film ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' at world championship races that year.</ref> but the light and reliable cars ran at the front from the start of the season. At the [[1966 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] at [[Reims-Gueux]], Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, [[Bruce McLaren]], has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (''cf'' [[Surtees]], [[Hill (constructor)|Hill]] and [[Fittipaldi Automotive]]). In [[1967 Formula One season|1967]], the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]]. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 92. Hulme, Tauranac and Frank Hallam, Repco-Brabham's chief engineer, all shared this view.</ref> The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.<ref>Fearnley (May 2006) pp. 34\u201340</ref>\n\nFor [[1968 Formula One season|1968]], Austrian [[Jochen Rindt]] replaced Hulme, who had left to join [[McLaren]]. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new [[Cosworth DFV]], but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast\u2014Rindt set [[pole position]] twice during the season\u2014but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.<ref>Fearnley (May 2006) p. 41</ref>\n\n[[File:1970 Brands Hatch Race of Champions Jack Brabham BT33.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Brabham BT33]]. Technically conservative, Brabham did not produce a [[monocoque]] car until 1970.]]\nAlthough Brabham bought Cosworth DFV engines for the [[1969 Formula One season|1969 season]], Rindt left to join Lotus. His replacement, [[Jacky Ickx]], had a strong second half to the season, winning in [[1969 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1969 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], after Brabham was sidelined by a testing accident.<ref>Henry p. 85</ref> Ickx finished second in the Drivers' Championship, with 37&nbsp;points to [[Jackie Stewart]]'s 63. Brabham himself took a couple of pole positions and two top-3 finishes, but did not finish half the races. The team were second in the Constructors' Championship, aided by second places at [[1969 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and [[1969 United States Grand Prix|Watkins Glen]] scored by [[Piers Courage]], driving a Brabham for the [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] privateer squad.<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 79\u201380</ref>\n\nBrabham intended to retire at the end of the 1969 season and sold his share in the team to Tauranac. However, Rindt's late decision to remain with Lotus meant that Brabham drove for another year.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 109 & Brabham, Nye (2004) pp. 230\u2013231. He was therefore technically a team employee in his final season.</ref> He took his last win in the opening race of the [[1970 Formula One season|1970 season]] and was competitive throughout the year, although mechanical failures blunted his challenge.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 93</ref> Aided by number-two driver [[Rolf Stommelen]], the team came fourth in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n===Ron Tauranac (1971)===\n[[File:1971 Race of Champions G Hill Brabham BT34.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Brabham BT34]]. [[Graham Hill]] took his final Formula One win in the non-championship [[BRDC International Trophy]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].]]Tauranac signed double world champion [[Graham Hill]] and young Australian [[Tim Schenken]] to drive for the [[1971 Formula One season|1971 season]]. Tauranac designed the unusual 'lobster claw' [[Brabham BT34|BT34]], featuring twin [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]s mounted ahead of the front wheels, a single example of which was built for Hill. Although Hill, no longer a front-runner since his 1969 accident, took his final Formula One win in the non-championship [[BRDC International Trophy]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]],<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 114\u201317</ref> the team scored only seven&nbsp;championship points.\n\nTauranac, an engineer at heart, started to feel his Formula One budget of around \u00a3100,000 was a gamble he could not afford to take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 113</ref> He sold the company for \u00a3100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]], Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the [[Connaught Engineering|Connaught]] team.

The car was used in the {{F1|1974}} and {{F1|1975}} seasons.]]\n\nTauranac left Brabham early in the [[1972 Formula One season|1972 season]] after Ecclestone changed the way the company was organised without consulting him. Ecclestone has since said \"In retrospect, the relationship was never going to work\", noting that \"[Tauranac and I] both take the view: 'Please be reasonable, do it my way'\".<ref>Lawrence. pp. 116\u2013118</ref> The highlights of an aimless year, during which the team ran three different models, were pole position for Argentinian driver [[Carlos Reutemann]] at his home race at [[Buenos Aires]] and a victory in the non-championship Interlagos Grand Prix. For the [[1973 Formula One season|1973 season]], Ecclestone promoted the young South African engineer [[Gordon Murray]] to chief designer and moved Herbie Blash from the Formula Two programme to become the Formula One team manager. Both would remain with the team for the next 15 years. For 1973, Murray produced the triangular cross-section BT42, with which Reutemann scored two podium finishes and finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship.\n\nIn the [[1974 Formula One season|1974 season]], Reutemann took the first three victories of his Formula One career, and Brabham's first since 1970. The team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship, fielding the much more competitive [[Brabham BT44|BT44s]]. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the team were favourites to win the [[1975 Formula One season|1975 title]]. The year started well, with a first win for Brazilian driver [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Carlos Pace]] at the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] circuit in his native [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races.<ref>Gill (ed.) (1976) p. 103</ref> Pace took another two podiums and finished sixth in the championship; while Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the [[1975 German Grand Prix]], and finished third in the Drivers' Championship. The team likewise ranked third in the Constructors' Championship at the end of the year.\n\nWhile rival teams Lotus and McLaren relied on the Cosworth DFV engine from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Ecclestone sought a competitive advantage by investigating other options. Despite the success of Murray's Cosworth-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] to use their large and powerful [[flat-12]] engine from the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]]. The engines were free, but they rendered the new [[Brabham BT45|BT45s]], now in red [[Martini Racing]] livery, unreliable and overweight.<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 159\u2013161</ref> The 1976 and [[1977 Formula One season|1977 seasons]] saw Brabham fall toward the back of the field again. Reutemann negotiated a release from his contract before the end of the 1976 season and signed with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Ulsterman [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] replaced him at Brabham for 1977. Watson lost near certain victory in the [[1977 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] (Dijon) of that year when his car ran low on fuel on the last lap and was passed by Mario Andretti's Lotus, with Watson's second place being the team's best result of the season. The car often showed at the head of races, but the unreliability of the Alfa Romeo engine was a major problem. The team lost Pace early in the 1977 season when he died in a [[light aircraft]] accident.<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 164, 167</ref>\n\n====Alfa Romeo and the 'fan car'====\n[[File:2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed Brabham BT46B Fan car.jpg|thumb|right|1978 [[Brabham BT46]]B-Alfa Romeo, the so-called \"Fan Car\" due to the large fan at the rear of the car.]]\nFor the [[1978 Formula One season|1978 season]], Murray's [[Brabham BT46|BT46]] featured several new technologies to overcome the weight and packaging difficulties caused by the [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines. Ecclestone signed then two-time Formula One world champion [[Niki Lauda]] from Ferrari through a deal with Italian dairy products company [[Parmalat]] which met the cost of Lauda ending his Ferrari contract and made up his salary to the \u00a3200,000 Ferrari was offering. 1978 was the year of the dominant [[Lotus 79]] \"wing car\", which used [[aerodynamic]] [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] to stick to the track when cornering, but Lauda won two races in the BT46, one with the controversial \"B\" or \"[[Brabham BT46#Brabham BT46B .E2.80.93 the .22Fan car.22|fan car]]\" version.<ref>Details of BT46 and 1978 season: Henry (1985) p. 171, pp. 179\u2013189\n* Lauda's move and salary: Lovell (2004) p. 98</ref>\n\nThe partnership with Alfa Romeo ended during the [[1979 Formula One season|1979 season]], the team's first with young Brazilian driver [[Nelson Piquet]]. Murray designed the full-ground effect [[Brabham BT48|BT48]] around a rapidly developed new Alfa Romeo V12 engine and incorporated an effective \"carbon-carbon braking\" system\u2014[[#Technical innovation|a technology Brabham pioneered in 1976]]. However, unexpected movement of the car's aerodynamic [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] made its handling unpredictable and the new engine was unreliable. The team dropped to eighth in the Constructors' Championship by the end of the season.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 191</ref> Alfa Romeo started testing their own Formula One car during the season, prompting Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines, a move Murray described as being \"like having a holiday\".<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 213, 215</ref> The new, lighter, Cosworth-powered [[Brabham BT49|BT49]] was introduced before the end of the year at the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]; where after practice Lauda announced his immediate retirement from driving, later saying that he \"was no longer getting any pleasure from driving round and round in circles\".<ref>Henry (1985) p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:2005 Brands Hatch A1GP 25 Sept Christian Glaesel Brabham BT49D.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The [[Brabham BT49]] competed over four seasons, winning one championship]]\n\nThe team used the BT49 over four seasons. In the [[1980 Formula One season|1980 season]] Piquet scored three wins and the team took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the introduction of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the [[1981 Formula One season|1981 season]], incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid [[ride height]] limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray,<ref name=\"RoePiq\">Roebuck (1986) p. 114</ref> took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit [[#Controversy|amid accusations of cheating]]. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the [[WilliamsF1|Williams team]].\n\n[[Renault F1|Renault]] had introduced [[turbocharged]] engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] four-cylinder [[BMW M12|M12]] turbocharged engine in the summer of 1981. For the [[1982 Formula One season|1982 season]] the team designed a new car, the [[Brabham BT50|BT50]], around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, the [[BMW M10]]. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D in the early part of the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers [[Riccardo Patrese]], who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the [[1982 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the [[1983 Formula One season|1983 season]], Piquet took the championship lead from [[Renault F1|Renault]]'s [[Alain Prost]] at the last race of the year, the [[1983 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. [[Riccardo Patrese]] was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period\u2014the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n[[File:Piquet - Brabham-BMW BT 54 1985-08-02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nelson Piquet]] and his [[Brabham BT54|BT54]] were hampered by [[Pirelli]] tyres in {{F1|1985}}]]\n\nPiquet took the team's last wins: two in 1984 by winning the seventh and eighth races of that season, the [[1984 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] and the [[1984 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]], and one in 1985 by winning the [[1985 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]]. He finished fifth in 1984 and a mere eighth in 1985 in the respective Drivers' Championships.<ref name=\"RoePiq\"/> After seven years and two world championships, Piquet felt he was worth more than Ecclestone's salary offer for 1986, and reluctantly left for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team at the end of the season.\n\nFor the [[1986 Formula One season|1986 season]], [[Riccardo Patrese]] returned to Brabham, and was joined by [[Elio de Angelis]]. The season was a disaster for Brabham, scoring only two points. Murray's radical long and low [[Brabham BT55|BT55]], with its BMW M12 engine tilted over to improve its aerodynamics and lower its centre of gravity, had severe reliability issues, and the Pirelli tyres performed poorly. De Angelis became the Formula One team's only fatality when he died in a testing accident at the [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] circuit. [[Derek Warwick]], who replaced de Angelis, was close to scoring two points for fifth in the [[1986 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], but a problem on the last lap dropped him out of the points.\n\nIn August, BMW after considering running their own in-house team, announced their departure from Formula One at the end of the season. Murray, who had largely taken over the running of the team as Ecclestone became more involved with his role at the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], felt that \"the way the team had operated for 15 years broke down\". He left Brabham in November to join [[McLaren]].<ref name=\"BGEnd\">Lovell (2004) pp. 161\u2013164</ref>\n\nEcclestone held BMW to their contract for the [[1987 Formula One season|1987 season]], but the German company would only supply the laydown engine. The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold for use by the [[Arrows (F1)|Arrows]] team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was only slightly more successful than the previous year\u2014Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the [[1987 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] and the [[1987 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]]. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season-ending [[1988 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to [[EuroBrun]] team owner [[Walter Brun]] for an unknown price.\n\n===Joachim Luhti (1989)===\nBrun soon sold the team on, this time to Swiss financier Joachim Luhti, who brought it back into Formula One for the [[1989 Formula One season|1989 season]]. The new [[Brabham BT58]], powered by a [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] [[V8 engine]] (originally another of Jack Brabham's companies), was produced for the [[1989 Formula One season|1989 season]].<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 254. Engine Developments, the company which builds Judd engines, was a company Jack Brabham set up in partnership with John Judd after his retirement from driving in 1970. Judd had previously worked for Brabham on the Repco project. John Judd had based the engine, dubbed the '''CV''', on a [[Honda]] block and was something the Japanese company was looking at as it looked to move into the North American based [[Champ Car|IndyCar racing]].</ref> Italian driver [[Stefano Modena]], who had driven for the team in the [[1987 Australian Grand Prix]] in a one off drive for the team, drove alongside the more experienced [[Martin Brundle]] who was returning to Formula One after spending 1988 winning the [[1988 World Sportscar Championship season|World Sportscar Championship]] for [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]. Modena took the team's last podium: a third place at the [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] (Brundle, who had only just scraped through pre-qualifying by 0.021 seconds before qualifying a brilliant 4th, had been running third but was forced to stop to replace a flat battery, finally finishing sixth). The team also failed to make the grid sometimes: Brundle failed to prequalify at the [[1989 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] and the [[1989 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]]. The team finished 9th in the Constructors' Championship at the end of the season.\n\n===Middlebridge Racing (1989\u20131992)===\nAfter Luhti's arrest on tax fraud charges in mid-1989,<ref>Slevin, Gary (2008) [http://www.f1rejects.com/centrale/submitted/brabham/index.html The Decline of Brabham] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014120637/http://www.f1rejects.com/centrale/submitted/brabham/index.html |date=14 October 2008 }}.

Middlebridge Group Limited, a Japanese engineering firm owned by billionaire Koji Nakauchi, was already involved with established [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]] team Middlebridge Racing and gained control of Brabham for the [[1990 Formula One season|1990 season]]. Herbie Blash had returned to run the team in 1989 and continued to do so in 1990. Middlebridge paid for its purchase using \u00a31&nbsp;million loaned to them by finance company Landhurst Leasing,<ref name=\"Landhurst\">{{cite news|title=Formula One obsession led to pounds 50m Landhurst fraud|author=John Willcock|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/formula-one-obsession-led-to-pounds-50m-landhurst-fraud-1236602.html|newspaper=[[Independent (newspaper)|The Independent]]|date=18 October 1997|accessdate=26 April 2011|location=London}}</ref> but the team remained underfunded and would only score a few more points finishes in its last three seasons. Jack Brabham's youngest son, [[David Brabham|David]], raced for the Formula One team for a short time in 1990 including the season-ending [[1990 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] (the first time a Brabham had driven a Brabham car in an [[Australian Grand Prix]] since [[1968 Australian Grand Prix|1968]]). 1990 was a disastrous year, with Modena's fifth place in the season-opening [[1990 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] being the only top six finish. The team finished ninth in the Constructors' Championship. Brundle and fellow Briton [[Mark Blundell]], scored only three points during the [[1991 Formula One season|1991 season]]. Due to poor results in the first half of 1991, they had to prequalify in the second half of the season; Blundell failed to do so in Japan, as did Brundle in Australia. The team finished 10th in the Constructors' Championship, behind another struggling British team, Lotus. The 1992 season started with [[Eric van de Poele]] and [[Giovanna Amati]] after [[Akihiko Nakaya]] was denied a superlicense. [[Damon Hill]], the son of another former Brabham driver and World Champion, debuted in the team after Amati was dropped when her sponsorship failed to materialise. Amati, the fifth woman to race in Formula One, ended her career with three DNQs.\n\nArgentine [[Sergio Rinland]] designed the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when [[Yamaha Motor Company Ltd.|Yamaha]] powered the cars. In the [[1992 Formula One season|1992 season]] the cars (which were updated versions of the 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the [[1992 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]], where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner, [[Ayrton Senna]]. After the end of that race the team ran out of funds and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the \u00a36&nbsp;million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into [[Administration order|administration]]. The [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]] investigated the case. Landhurst's managing directors were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge.<ref name=\"Landhurst\"/> It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. (''cf'' [[March Engineering]], [[Fondmetal]] and [[Andrea Moda Formula]]). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's [[Administrative receivership|receivers]] in 1993.<ref>Baker (10 October 1993)</ref> Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash.

Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build [[formula racing]] cars to customer teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50&nbsp;percent of the shares.<ref name=\"Law31\"/> Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply and the use of the MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.<ref>Tauranac referred to this as Brabham's trade; they had first met at the small [[machine shop]] Brabham ran in Sydney in the early 1950s.</ref>\n\nFrom 1963 to 1965, MRD was not directly involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry.<ref>To confuse the relationship between the two companies further, MRD was renamed Brabham Racing Developments between 1962 and 1964. Henry (1985) p. 24</ref> Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at \u00a33,000 per car,<ref>Fearnley (May 2006) p. 39</ref> although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested that he was no longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 74\u201375</ref> After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.\n\nDespite only building its first car in 1961, by the mid-1960s MRD had overtaken established constructors like Cooper to become the largest manufacturer of single-seat racing cars in the world,<ref>Unique p. 111</ref> and by 1970 had built over 500 cars.<ref name=\"car numbers\">Lawrence (1999) p. 207</ref> Of the other Formula One teams which used Brabhams, [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] and the [[Rob Walker Racing Team]] were the most successful. The [[1965 British Grand Prix]] saw seven Brabhams compete, only two of them from the works team, and there were usually four or five at championship Grands Prix throughout that season. The firm built scores of cars for the lower formulae each year, peaking with 89 cars in 1966.<ref name=\"car numbers\"/> Brabham had the reputation of providing customers with cars of a standard equal to those used by the works team, which worked \"[[wiktionary:out of the box|out of the box]]\". The company provided a high degree of support to its customers\u2014including Jack Brabham helping customers set up their cars. During this period the cars were usually known as \"Repco Brabhams\", not because of the Repco engines used in Formula One between 1966 and 1968, but because of a smaller-scale sponsorship deal through which the Australian company had been providing parts to Jack Brabham since his Cooper days.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:Brabham BT40 of Tim Kuchel.jpg|thumb|left|The BT40 was the last [[Formula Two]] model from Brabham.]]\n[[File:Alfa Romeo 164 procar.jpg|thumb|right|The Brabham [[Alfa Romeo 164|Alfa Romeo 164 \"procar\"]] (1988)]]\nAt the end of 1971 Bernie Ecclestone bought MRD. He retained the Brabham brand, as did subsequent owners. Although the production of customer cars continued briefly under Ecclestone's ownership, he believed the company needed to focus on Formula One to succeed. The last production customer Brabhams were the Formula Two BT40 and the Formula Three BT41 of 1973,<ref>Hodges (1990) p. 39</ref> although Ecclestone sold ex-works Formula One BT44Bs to [[RAM Racing]] as late as 1976.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 156.

This was intended for a racing series for major manufacturers to support Formula One Grands Prix, and was designated the Brabham BT57.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-mcdall.html|title=People: Allen McDonald|author=|work=grandprix.com|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Racing history\u2014other categories==\n[[File:Brabham BT25.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Brabham's last USAC race-winning car\u2014the Brabham BT25 IndyCar of 1968]]\n[[File:2005 Goodwood Festival of Speed F2 Brabham BT18 Honda.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Brabham BT18-Honda completely dominated [[Formula Two]] in 1966.]]\n[[File:1969 F3 Guards Trophy Brands Hatch James Hunt Brabham BT21.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Top drivers used Brabham F3 cars in their early careers. ([[James Hunt]], 1969)]]\n\n===IndyCar===\nBrabham cars competed at the [[Indianapolis 500]] from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. After an abortive project in 1962,<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 30</ref> MRD was commissioned in 1964 to build an IndyCar chassis powered by an American [[Offenhauser]] engine. The resultant BT12 chassis was raced by Jack Brabham as the \"Zink-Urschel Trackburner\" at the [[1964 Indianapolis 500|1964 event]] and retired with a fuel tank problem. The car was entered again in [[1966 Indianapolis 500|1966]], taking a third place for [[Jim McElreath]]. From 1968 to 1970, Brabham returned to Indianapolis, at first with a 4.2-litre version of the Repco V8 the team used in Formula One\u2014with which [[Peter Revson]] finished fifth in 1969\u2014before reverting to the Offenhauser engine for 1970.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 240</ref> The Brabham-Offenhauser combination was entered again in 1971 by [[Christopher J.C. Agajanian|J.C. Agajanian]], finishing fifth in the hands of [[Bill Vukovich II]].<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 114</ref> Although no Brabham car ever won at Indianapolis, McElreath won four [[United States Automobile Club]] (USAC) races over 1965 and 1966 in the BT12. The \"Dean Van Lines Special\" in which [[Mario Andretti]] won the 1965 USAC national championship was a direct copy of this car, made with permission from Brabham by Andretti's crew chief Clint Brawner.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 57. Brawner repaired BT12 after a crash in 1964. As part of the deal he was allowed to make a copy of the then still unusual mid-engined design.</ref> Revson took Brabham's final USAC race win in a BT25 in 1969, using the Repco engine.<ref name=\"BrabIndy\">Lawrence (1999) p. 99</ref>\n\n===Formula Two===\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often continued to compete in [[Formula Two]]. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a [[Honda]] engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races in the hands of the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.<ref>Unique p. 117</ref>\n\n===Formula Three===\nThe first [[Formula Three]] Brabham, the BT9, won only four major races in 1964. The BT15 which followed in 1965 was a highly successful design. 58 cars were sold, which won 42 major races. Further developments of the same concept, including wings by the end of the decade, were highly competitive up until 1971. The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were ordered, it was less successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.<ref>Hodges (1998) pp. 34\u201339</ref>\n\n===Formula 5000===\nBrabham made one car for [[Formula 5000]] racing, the [[Brabham BT43]]. Rolled out in late 1973 it was tested in early 1974 by John Watson at Silverstone before making its debut at the Rothmans F5000 Championship Round at Monza on June 30, 1974 driven by [[Martin Birrane]]. Former [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] [[Kevin Bartlett (racing driver)|Kevin Bartlett]] used the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] powered [[Brabham BT43]] to finish 3rd in the [[1978 Australian Drivers' Championship]] including finishing 5th in the [[1978 Australian Grand Prix]].\n\n===Sports cars===\nTauranac did not enjoy designing sports cars and could only spare a small amount of his time from MRD's very successful single-seater business. Only 14 sports car models were built between 1961 and 1972, out of a total production of almost 600 chassis.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 205\u2013207</ref> The BT8A was the only one built in any numbers, and was quite successful in national level racing in the UK in 1964 and 1965.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 55</ref> The design was \"stretched\" in 1966 to become the one-off BT17, originally fitted with the 4.3-litre version of the Repco engine for [[Can-Am]] racing. It was quickly abandoned by MRD after engine reliability problems became evident.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n==Technical innovation==\n[[File:2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed Brabham BT46B Fan car.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 1978 [[Brabham BT46|BT46B \"Fan car\"]] won its only race before being banned.]]\nBrabham was considered a technically conservative team in the 1960s, chiefly because it persevered with traditional \"[[spaceframe]]\" cars long after Lotus introduced lighter, stiffer \"[[monocoque]]\" chassis to Formula One in 1962. Chief designer Tauranac reasoned that monocoques of the time were not usefully stiffer than well designed spaceframe chassis, and were harder to repair and less suitable for MRD's customers.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 44\u201345</ref> His \"old fashioned\" cars won the Brabham team the 1966 and 1967 championships, and were competitive in Formula One until rule changes forced a move to monocoques in 1970.<ref>Nye (1986) p. 60. Brabham's BT26As and Matra's experimental four wheel drive MS84 of 1969 were the last cars with spaceframe chassis cars in F1. For 1970 the FIA mandated the use of \"bag tanks\" for fuel, which were to be carried inside box structures. This effectively forced the team to design a monocoque structure. From 1968 Brabham's IndyCars were monocoques for the same reason.</ref>\n\nDespite the perceived conservatism, in 1963 Brabham was the first Formula One team to use a [[wind tunnel]] to hone their designs to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 39. The initial tests were carried out at the [[Motor Industry Research Association]] wind tunnel under the auspices of Malcolm Sayer, who had been responsible for the aerodynamics of the [[Jaguar D-type]] Le Mans-winning car.</ref> The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly the most important factor in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic [[downforce]] to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix]], Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 100</ref>\n\nThe team's most fertile period of technical innovation came in the 1970s and 1980s when [[Gordon Murray]] became technical director. During 1976, the team introduced \"carbon-carbon [[Disc brake|brakes]]\" to Formula One, which promised reduced \"[[unsprung weight]]\" and better stopping performance due to carbon's greater [[coefficient of friction]]. The initial versions used [[reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon composite]] [[brake pads]] and a [[steel]] disc faced with carbon \"pucks\". The technology was not reliable at first; in 1976, Carlos Pace crashed at {{convert|180|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at the [[\u00d6sterreichring]] circuit after heat build-up in the brakes boiled the [[brake fluid]], leaving him with no way of stopping the car.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 163</ref> By 1979, Brabham had developed an effective carbon-carbon braking system, combining structural carbon discs with carbon brake pads.<ref name=\"Carbon Fibre\">Howard (June 2006) p. 52. Interview with Gordon Murray and [[John Barnard]] on the early uses of Carbon Fibre in Formula One for brakes and chassis structure.</ref> By the late 1980s, carbon brakes were used by all competitors in almost all top level motor sports.\n\nAlthough Brabham experimented with airdams and underbody skirts in the mid-1970s, the team, like the rest of the field, did not immediately understand Lotus's development of a [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] car in 1977. The [[Brabham BT46|Brabham BT46B]] \"Fan car\" of 1978, generated enormous downforce with a fan, which sucked air from beneath the car, although its claimed use was for engine cooling. The car only raced once in the Formula One World Championship\u2014[[Niki Lauda]] winning the [[1978 Swedish Grand Prix]]\u2014before a [[wiktionary:loophole|loophole]] in the regulations was closed by the FIA.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 186\u2013187. It is often claimed that the car was never banned, but rather withdrawn by Ecclestone. Ecclestone did agree to withdraw it after three races, but the FIA changed the regulations to render \"fan cars\" in general, not the BT46B in particular, illegal before it could race again.</ref>\n\nAlthough in 1979 Murray was the first to use lightweight \"[[Carbon fibre reinforced plastic|carbon fibre composite]]\" panels to stiffen Brabham's [[aluminium|aluminium alloy]] monocoques, he echoed his predecessor Tauranac in being the last to switch to the new fully composite monocoques. Murray was reluctant to build the entire chassis from composite materials until he understood their behaviour in a crash, an understanding achieved in part through an instrumented [[crash test]] of a BT49 chassis.<ref name=\"Carbon Fibre\"/> The team did not follow McLaren's 1981 [[McLaren MP4/1|MP4/1]] with their own fully composite chassis until the \"lowline\" BT55 in 1986,<ref name=\"AZBrabham\">Hodges (1998) p. 43</ref> the last team to do so. This technology is now used in all top level single seater racing cars.\n\nFor the 1981 season the FIA introduced a {{convert|6|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} minimum [[ride height]] for the cars, intended to slow them in corners by limiting the downforce created by aerodynamic ground effect. Gordon Murray devised a \"[[hydropneumatic suspension]]\" system for the BT49C, which allowed the car to settle to a much lower ride height at speed. Brabham were accused of cheating by other teams, although Murray believes that the system met the letter of the regulations. No action was taken against the team and others soon produced systems with similar effects.<ref>Henry (1985) pp. 223\u2013225</ref>\n\nAt the [[1982 British Grand Prix]], Brabham reintroduced the idea of re-fuelling and changing the car's tyres during the race, unseen since the [[1957 Formula One season]], to allow their drivers to sprint away at the start of races on a light fuel load and soft tyres. After studying techniques used at the [[Indianapolis 500]] and in [[NASCAR]] racing in the United States, the team were able to refuel and re-tyre the car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of the race. In 1982 Murray felt the tactic did little more than \"get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning\", but in 1983 the team made good use of the tactic.<ref>Hamilton (ed.) (1983) pp. 63\u201372 ''Pitstops: A split-second spectacle'' feature by [[Denis Jenkinson]].</ref> Refuelling was banned for 1984, and did not reappear until the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]] (until it was banned again in [[2010 Formula One season|2010]] as a part of cost cutting measures), but tyre changes have remained part of Formula One.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Maurice|title=Ayrton Senna would applaud formula one's 2010 rebirth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/03/formula-one-2010-refuelling-ayrton-senna|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd|accessdate=1 May 2011|location=London|date=3 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nThe fan car and hydropneumatic suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham was accused of going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver [[Jacques Laffite]] was among those to claim that the cars were fitted with heavily ballasted [[Coachwork|bodywork]] before being weighed at [[scrutineer]]ing. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 225</ref>\n\nFrom 1978, Ecclestone was president of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]] (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 255</ref> At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the [[Octane rating|Research Octane Number]] (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.<ref>Drackett (1985) p. 133. Although \"protested\", as used by Drackett, implies a formal protest, he does not specify this, and Henry (1985) p. 267 says \"no action was ever taken\".</ref>\n\n==Championship results==\n{{Main article|Brabham Grand Prix results}}\n\nResults achieved by the \"works\" Brabham team.

Competing against [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] for a contract to build 200 bombers, the [[Boeing]] entry (prototype Model 299/XB-17) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps' performance specifications. Although Boeing lost the contract (to the [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]]) because the prototype crashed, the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress variants|design advances]],<ref>Parker 2013, pp. 35, 40\u201348.</ref><ref>Herman 2012, pp. 292\u2013299, 305, 333.</ref> becoming the [[List of most-produced aircraft|third-most produced bomber]] of all time, behind the four-engined [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] and the multirole, twin-engined [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]]. \n\nThe B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAC in the daylight [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign of World War&nbsp;II]] against German industrial and military targets. The United States [[Eighth Air Force]], based at many airfields in central and southern England, and the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, complemented the [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s nighttime area bombing in the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]] to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for [[Operation Overlord|the invasion of France]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Carey Pointblank\" /> The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|War in the Pacific]], early in World War II, where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.<ref>Parker 2013, p. 41.</ref>\n\nFrom its prewar inception, the USAAC ([[United States Army Air Forces#Army Air Forces created|by June 1941, the USAAF]]) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a relatively fast, high-flying, long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload. It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base. The B-17 developed a reputation as an effective bomber, dropping more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War&nbsp;II. Of the {{Nowrap|1.5 million [[tonne]]s}} of bombs dropped on [[Nazi Germany]] and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft, 640,000&nbsp;tonnes were dropped from B-17s.<ref name=\"Yenne.p46\" /> In addition to its role as a bomber, the B-17 was also employed as a transport, antisubmarine aircraft, drone controller, and search-and-rescue aircraft.\n\nAs of May 2015, [[List of surviving Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses|10 aircraft]] remain airworthy, though none of them were ever flown in combat. Dozens more are in storage or on static display. The oldest of these is [[The Swoose|a D-series]] flown in combat in the Pacific and the Caribbean.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    =Boeing XB-17 (Model 299).jpg\n| caption1  = Model 299 ''NX13372''\n| image2    =Boeing XB-17 (Model 299) nose turret with gun.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Gun turret#Aircraft|Gun turret]] atop the Model 299's nose glazing\n| image3    =Boeing Model 299 crash.jpg\n| caption3  = Crashed Model 299\n| image4    =Boeing Y1B-17 in flight.jpg\n| caption4  = Boeing Y1B-17 in flight\n<!-- Please do not add more images here as it disrupts the spacing -->\n}}\nOn 8 August 1934, the USAAC tendered a proposal for a multiengine bomber to replace the [[Martin B-10]]. The Air Corps was looking for a bomber capable of reinforcing the air forces in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska.<ref name=\"Tate.p164\" /> Requirements were for it to carry a \"useful bombload\" at an altitude of {{convert|10000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} for 10 hours with a top speed of at least {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Swan Mil p74\" />\n\nThey also desired, but did not require, a range of {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2|abbr=on}} and a speed of {{convert |250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The competition for the air corps contract was to be decided by a \"fly-off\" between Boeing's design, the [[Douglas B-18 Bolo|Douglas DB-1]], and the [[Martin Model 146]] at [[Wilbur Wright Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].\n\nThe prototype B-17, with the Boeing factory designation of Model 299, was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and [[Edward Curtis Wells]], and was built at Boeing's own expense.<ref name=\"WoF p41\" /> It combined features of the company's experimental [[Boeing XB-15|XB-15]] bomber and [[Boeing 247|247]] transport.<ref name=\"Swan Mil p74\" /> The B-17's armament consisted of five .30 caliber (7.62&nbsp;mm) [[machine gun]]s, with a payload  up to {{convert|4800|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of bombs on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit. The aircraft was powered by four [[Pratt & Whitney R-1690]] Hornet [[radial engine]]s, each producing {{convert|750|hp|kW|-2|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Bowers Boeing p291-2\" />\n\nThe first flight of the Model 299 was on {{Nowrap|28 July}} 1935 with Boeing chief test pilot Leslie Tower at the controls.<ref name=\"first flight\" /><ref name=\"Sal.p46\" /> The day before, Richard Williams, a reporter for the ''[[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]]'', coined the name \"Flying Fortress\" when \u2013 observing the large number of machine guns sticking out from the new airplane \u2013 he described it as a \"15-ton flying fortress\" in a picture caption.<ref>Freeman 1993, p. 8.</ref> The most unusual<!--why?--> mount was in the nose, which allowed the single machine gun to be fired toward almost any frontal angle.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&hl=en&ei=kH7gTamNN4P40gH1u52xBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Army's Biggest Bomber Has Rotating Nose.\"] ''Popular Science Monthly,'' August 1937.</ref>\n\nBoeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use.<ref group=N>The ''Air Corps News Letter'', however, notes in its edition of 1 January 1938 ([http://newpreview.afnews.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110421-039.pdf ACNL Vol. XXI, No. 1, p. 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903213218/http://newpreview.afnews.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110421-039.pdf |date=3 September 2015 }}) an attempt by the Langley Field correspondent to apply the appellation \"Jeep\" to the B-17, which it objected to as \"not befitting\" the aircraft and adding, \"Why not let the term 'Flying Fortress' suffice?\"</ref> Boeing also claimed in some of the early press releases that Model 299 was the first combat aircraft that could continue its mission if one of its four engines failed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wN8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA519&dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=aJgvTv3XKdSgsQLVyIRv&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&sqi=2&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Giant Bomber Flies Four Miles Per Minute.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1935.</ref> On {{Nowrap|20 August 1935}}, the prototype flew from Seattle to Wright Field in 9 hours and 3 minutes at an average cruising speed of {{convert|252|mph|km/h}}, much faster than the competition.<ref name=\"NYTimes.299Record\" />\n\nAt the fly-off, the four-engined Boeing's performance was superior to those of the twin-engined DB-1 and Model 146.

At the same time, the German nightfighting ability noticeably improved to counter the nighttime strikes, challenging the conventional faith in the cover of darkness.<ref name=\"Weigley.341\" /> The 8th Air Force alone lost 176 bombers in October 1943,<ref name=\"Hess.p67\" /> and was to suffer similar casualties on {{Nowrap|11 January}} 1944 on missions to [[Oschersleben]], [[Halberstadt]], and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]].

As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor.<ref name=\"Boeing\" /> Defensive armament increased from four {{convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns and one {{convert|0.30|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} nose machine gun in the B-17C, to thirteen {{convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns in the B-17G. But because the bombers could not [[air combat manoeuvring|maneuver]] when attacked by fighters, and needed to be flown straight and level during their final bomb run, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-657-6304-24, Luftwaffe, Modelle eines Bombers und J\u00e4gers.jpg|thumb|left|German training model on how to attack a \"flying porcupine\" (''fliegendes Stachelschwein'')]]\n\nA 1943 survey by the [[USAAF]] found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans had left the protection of the main formation.<ref name=\"B-17.de 2\" /> To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb-group formation, which evolved into the staggered [[combat box]] formation in which all the B-17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns. This made a formation of bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters.<ref name=\"Manual 2\" /> ''Luftwaffe'' fighter pilots likened attacking a B-17 combat box formation to encountering a ''fliegendes Stachelschwein'', \"flying porcupine\", with dozens of machine guns in a combat box aimed at them from almost every direction. However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual aircraft could not engage in evasive maneuvers: they had to fly constantly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to German [[flak]]. Moreover, German fighter aircraft later developed the tactic of high-speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict damage with minimum risk.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} As a result, the B-17s' loss rate was up to 25% on some early missions. It was not until the advent of long-range fighter escorts (particularly the [[North American P-51 Mustang]]) and the resulting degradation of the ''Luftwaffe'' as an effective interceptor force between February and June 1944, that the B-17 became strategically potent.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:B-17 Schweinfurt.jpg|thumb|Formation flying through dense [[flak]] over [[Merseburg]], Germany]]\nThe B-17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely.<ref name=\"Manual\" /><ref name=\"browne\" /><ref name=\"Johnsen 2006\" /> Wally Hoffman, a B-17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War&nbsp;II, said, \"The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home.\"<ref name=\"Hoffman\" /> [[Martin Caidin]] reported one instance in which a B-17 suffered a midair collision with a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], losing an engine and suffering serious damage to both the starboard horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, and being knocked out of formation by the impact.

The three bombers, containing captured top secret [[Norden bombsight]]s, were then flown to Japan where they underwent extensive technical evaluation by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]]'s Air Technical Research Laboratory (Koku Gijutsu Kenkyujo) at Tachikawa. The \"D\" model was later deemed an obsolescent design. The two \"E\" models were used to develop B-17 air combat counter-tactics and also as enemy aircraft in several Japanese propaganda films. One of the captured \"E\" Flying Fortresses was photographed by U. S. aerial recon and code named \"Tachikawa 105\" after its wing span was measured; photo recon analysts never identified it as a captured B-17 until after the war.

On 23 January 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of the boat's designer [[Auguste Piccard]]) and US Navy Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]] achieved the goal of [[Project Nekton]].\n\n''Trieste'' was the first manned vessel to have reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Trip to the Deepest Part of the Ocean The Bathyscaphe Trieste carried two hydronauts to the Challenger Deep in 1960|url=http://geology.com/records/bathyscaphe-trieste.shtml|website=Geology.com|publisher=2005-2015 Geology.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Trieste nh96807.svg|thumb|300px|left|General arrangement drawing, showing the main features]]\n\n''Trieste'' consisted of a float chamber filled with [[gasoline]] (petrol) for [[buoyancy]], with a separate pressure sphere to hold the crew. This configuration (dubbed a \"[[bathyscaphe]]\" by the Piccards), allowed for a free dive, rather than the previous [[bathysphere]] designs in which a sphere was lowered to depth and raised again to the surface by a cable attached to a ship.\n\n''Trieste'' was designed by the Swiss scientist Auguste Piccard and originally built in Italy. His pressure sphere, composed of two sections, was built by the company Acciaierie [[Terni]]. The upper part was manufactured by the company [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico]], in the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] (on the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, now in Italy); hence the name chosen for the bathyscaphe. The installation of the pressure sphere was done in the Cantiere navale di [[Castellammare di Stabia]], near [[Naples]]. ''Trieste'' was launched on 26 August 1953 into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]]. The design was based on previous experience with the bathyscaphe ''[[FNRS-2]]''. ''Trieste'' was operated by the [[French Navy]]. After several years of operation in the Mediterranean Sea, the ''Trieste'' was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] in 1958 for $250,000.\n\nAt the time of [[Project Nekton]], ''Trieste'' was more than 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) long. The majority of this was a series of floats filled with {{convert|85,000|L|USgal}} of gasoline, and water ballast tanks were included at either end of the vessel, as well as releasable iron ballast in two conical hoppers along the bottom, fore and aft of the crew sphere. The crew occupied the 2.16&nbsp;m (7.09&nbsp;ft) pressure sphere, attached to the underside of the float and accessed from the deck of the vessel by a vertical shaft that penetrated the float and continued down to the sphere hatch.\n\nThe pressure sphere provided just enough room for two people. It provided completely independent life support, with a closed-circuit [[rebreather]] system similar to that used in modern spacecraft and spacesuits: oxygen was provided from pressure cylinders, and carbon dioxide was scrubbed from breathing air by being passed through canisters of [[Soda lime|soda-lime]]. Power was provided by batteries.\n\n[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste Piccard-Walsh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard aboard ''Trieste'']]\n\n''Trieste'' was subsequently fitted with a new pressure sphere,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bathyscaphe|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/media/reference/assets/bathyscaphe-1.pdf|website=National Geographic Education|publisher=2015 National Geographic Society|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> manufactured by the [[Krupp]] Steel Works of [[Essen, Germany]], in three finely-machined sections (an equatorial ring and two caps).\n\nTo withstand the enormous pressure of 1.25 [[tonne|metric tons]] per cm\u00b2 (110 [[MPa]]) at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the sphere's walls were {{convert|12.7|cm|in}} thick (it was [[Factor of safety|overdesigned]] to withstand considerably more than the rated pressure). The sphere weighed {{convert|14.25|MT|lb|abbr=off}} in air and {{convert|8|MT|lb|abbr=off}} in water (giving it an average specific gravity of 13/(13-8) = 2.6 times that of sea water). The float was necessary because of the sphere's density: it was not possible to design a sphere large enough to hold a person that could withstand the necessary pressures, yet also have metal walls thin enough for the sphere to be neutrally buoyant. Gasoline was chosen as the float fluid because it is less dense than water, and also less compressible, thus retaining its buoyant properties and negating the need for thick, heavy walls for the float chamber.\n[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste sphere.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Close-up of pressure sphere, with forward ballast silo at left]]\nObservation of the sea outside the craft was conducted directly by eye, via a single, very tapered, cone-shaped block of [[acrylic glass]] (Plexiglas), the only transparent substance identified which would withstand the external pressure. Outside illumination for the craft was provided by quartz [[arc lamp|arc-light]] bulbs, which proved to be able to withstand the over {{convert|1000|atm|psi|abbr=off}} (100 MPa) of pressure without any modification.\n\n{{convert|9|MT|lb|abbr=off}} of magnetic iron pellets were placed on the craft as ballast, both to speed the descent and allow ascent, since the extreme water pressures would not have permitted compressed air ballast-expulsion tanks to be used at great depths. This additional weight was held in place at the throats of two hopper-like ballast silos by electromagnets, so in case of an electrical failure the bathyscaphe would automatically rise to the surface.\n\nTransported to the [[Naval Electronics Laboratory]]'s facility in [[San Diego, California]], ''Trieste'' was modified extensively by the Americans, and then used in a series of deep-submergence tests in the Pacific Ocean during the next few years, culminating in the dive to the bottom of the Challenger Deep during January 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trieste Bathyscaphe |url=http://www.machine-history.com/Trieste%20Bathyscaphe |website=Machine-History.Com |publisher=from Time article 12 October 1953 |accessdate=27 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906084947/http://www.machine-history.com/Trieste%20Bathyscaphe |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Trieste (23 Jan 1960).jpeg|thumb|left|23 January 1960: ''Trieste'' just before the record dive.

on 27 July 1214 near the town of [[Bouvines]] in the [[County of Flanders]]. It was the conclusive battle of the [[Anglo-French War (1213\u201314)|1213\u20131214 Anglo-French War]]. A French army of some 7,000 men commanded by King [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] defeated an allied army of approximately 9,000 commanded by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]].\n\nIn early 1214, a great coalition was assembled against King Philip Augustus of France, consisting of Otto IV, [[King John of England]], Count [[Ferdinand, Prince of Portugal|Ferrand of Flanders]], Duke [[Henry I of Brabant]], Count [[William I of Holland]], Duke [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine|Theobald I of Lorraine]], and Duke [[Henry III of Limburg]]. Its objective was to dismember the [[Conquest (military)|conquests]] made by Philip earlier in his reign.\n\nAfter initial [[Maneuver warfare|manoeuvring]] in late July, battle was offered near Bouvines on 27 July. The long allied [[Column (formation)|column]] deployed slowly into battle order, leaving the Allies at a disadvantage. The superior [[discipline]] and order of the French knights allowed them to carry out a series of devastating [[Charge (warfare)|charges]], shattering the [[Flemish]] knights on the allied left wing and capturing Count Ferrand after three hours of combat. In the centre, the allied knights and infantry under Otto enjoyed initial success, scattering the French urban infantry [[militia]] around King Philip. The Allied infantrymen nearly killed Philip. A [[counterattack]] by French knights smashed the isolated allied infantry and Otto's entire centre division fell back. Emperor Otto himself was attacked by several French knights and had to be saved by his [[bodyguard]]s. Otto fled the battle and his knightly followers were defeated by the French knights, who went on to capture the Imperial [[Reichsadler|eagle]] [[Heraldic flag|standard]]. With the Allied centre and left wing routed, only the right wing under [[Renaud de Dammartin|Renaud of Boulogne]] and [[William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William de Longespee]] held on. They were killed, captured or driven from the field. A pursuit was not conducted as it was nearly dark.\n\nThe crushing French victory dashed English and Flemish hopes of regaining lost territories. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] deposed the humiliated Otto as Emperor after the battle. King John was forced to agree to the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 by his discontented barons and hand over English-occupied Anjou to Philip in a peace settlement. Counts Ferrand, Renaud and Longespee were captured and imprisoned. The balance of power in Europe shifted, with the [[pope]]s of the 13th century increasingly seeking the support of a powerful France.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn 1214, [[Ferdinand, Count of Flanders|Ferdinand, Infante of Portugal, and Count of Flanders]] desired the return of the cities of Aire-sur-la-Lys and Saint-Omer, which he had recently lost to [[Philip II of France|Philip II, King of France]] in the [[Treaty of Pont-\u00e0-Vendin]]. He thus broke allegiance with Philip and assembled a broad coalition including [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto IV]], [[John, King of England|King John I of England]], [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Duke Henry I of Brabant]], [[William I, Count of Holland|Count William I of Holland]], [[Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine|Duke Theobald I of Lorraine]], and [[Henry III, Duke of Limburg|Duke Henry III of Limburg]].{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=239}}\n\nThe campaign was planned by John, who was the fulcrum of the alliance; his plan was to draw the French away from Paris southward towards his forces and keep them occupied, while the main army, under Emperor Otto IV, marched on Paris from the north.{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=239}} John's plan was followed initially, but the allies in the north moved slowly. John, after two encounters with the French, retreated to [[Aquitaine]] on 3 July.\n\nOn 23 July, having summoned his [[vassal]]s, Philip had an army consisting of 6,000 to 8,000 soldiers.{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|pp=245\u2013246}} The Emperor finally succeeded in concentrating his forces at [[Valenciennes]], although this did not include John, and in the interval Philip had counter-marched northward and regrouped.{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=240}} Philip now took the offensive himself, and after manoeuvring to obtain good ground for his cavalry he offered battle on 27 July, on the plain east of Bouvines and the river Marque.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911 |wstitle=Bouvines |volume=4 |pages=336\u2013337}} This cites:\n* [[Charles Oman]], ''History of the Art of War'', vii. pp. 457\u2013480\n* K\u00f5hler, ''Kriegsgechichte, &c.'', i. 140\n* Delpech, ''Tactique au XIII<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle, 127.</ref> Otto was surprised by the speed of his enemy and was thought to have been caught unprepared by Philip,{{efn|The chroniclers say that Otto also strongly expressed his surprise to find himself facing the French army, while he believed they were on the run.

However, the triumvirate broke down when Octavian saw [[Caesarion]], the professed son of [[Julius Caesar]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Roller|first=Duane W.|title=Cleopatra: A Biography|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|pages=70\u201373}}</ref> and Queen [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]] of Egypt, as a major threat to his power.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} This occurred when [[Mark Antony]], the other most influential member of the triumvirate, abandoned his wife, Octavian's sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia Minor]]. Afterwards he moved to Egypt to start a long-term romance with Cleopatra, becoming the ''de facto'' stepfather to Caesarion. Such an affair was doomed to become a political scandal.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Antony was inevitably perceived by Octavian and the majority of the Roman Senate as the leader of a separatist movement that threatened to break the unity of the Roman Republic.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n[[File:Ballistae on roman ship.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Ballista]]e on a Roman ship]]\n\nOctavian's prestige and, more importantly, the loyalty of his legions had been initially boosted by Julius Caesar's legacy of 44 BC, by which 19-year-old Octavian was officially adopted as Caesar's only son and the sole legitimate heir of his enormous wealth. Antony had been the most important and most successful senior officer in Caesar's army (''[[Master of the Horse#Magister Equitum (Ancient Rome)|magister equitum]]'') and, thanks to his military record, claimed a substantial share of the political support of Caesar's soldiers and veterans. Both Octavian and Antony had fought against their common enemies in the civil war that followed the assassination of Caesar.\n\nAfter years of loyal cooperation with Octavian, Antony started to act independently, eventually arousing his rival's suspicion that he was vying to become sole master of Rome. When he left Octavia Minor and moved to [[Alexandria]] to become Cleopatra's official partner, he led many Roman politicians to believe that he was trying to become the unchecked ruler of Egypt and other eastern kingdoms while still maintaining his command over the many Roman legions in the East.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} As a personal challenge to Octavian's prestige, Antony tried to get Caesarion accepted as a true heir of Caesar, even though the legacy did not mention him. Antony and Cleopatra formally elevated Caesarion, then 13, to power in 34 BC, giving him the vague but alarming title of [[King of Kings|\"King of the Kings\"]] ([[Donations of Alexandria]]).{{sfn|David|David|2002|page=35}}{{sfn|Kebric|2005|page=109}} Being a son of Caesar, such an entitlement was felt as a threat to Roman republican traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} It was widely believed that Antony had once offered a [[diadem]] to Caesar.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Thereafter, Octavian started a propaganda war, denouncing Antony as an enemy of Rome, asserting that he was seeking to establish a personal monarchy over the entire Roman Empire on behalf of Caesarion, circumventing the Roman Senate.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} It was also said that Antony intended to move the capital of the empire to Alexandria.{{sfn|Potter|2009|page=161}}{{sfn|Scullard|2013|page=150}}\n\nAs the Second Triumvirate formally expired on the last day of 33 BC, Antony wrote to the Senate that he did not wish to be reappointed. He hoped that he might be regarded by them as their champion against the ambition of Octavian, whom he presumed would not be willing to abandon his position in a similar manner.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The causes of mutual dissatisfaction between the two had been accumulating. Antony complained that Octavian had exceeded his powers in deposing [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], in taking over the countries held by [[Sextus Pompeius]] and in enlisting soldiers for himself without sending half to him. Octavian complained that Antony had no authority to be in Egypt; that his execution of Sextus Pompeius was illegal; that his treachery to the [[king of Armenia]] disgraced the Roman name; that he had not sent half the proceeds of the spoils to Rome according to his agreement; and that his connection with Cleopatra and the acknowledgment of Caesarion as a legitimate son of Caesar were a degradation of his office and a menace to himself.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=775-779}}\n\nDuring 32 BC one-third of the Senate and both [[consul]]s allied with Antony. The consuls had determined to conceal the extent of Antony's demands. [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Gnaeus Ahenobarbus]] seems to have wished to keep quiet, but [[Gaius Sosius]] on 1 January made an elaborate speech in favor of Antony, and would have proposed the confirmation of his act had it not been vetoed by a tribune. Octavian was not present, but at the next meeting made a reply of such a nature that both consuls left Rome to join Antony; Antony, when he heard of it, after publicly divorcing Octavia, came at once to [[Ephesus]] with Cleopatra, where a vast fleet was gathered from all parts of the East, of which Cleopatra furnished a large proportion.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=775-779}} After staying with his allies at Samos, Antony moved to Athens. His land forces, which had been in Armenia, came down to the coast of Asia and embarked under L. Canidius Crassus.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nOctavian was not behind in his strategic preparations. Military operations began in 31 BC, when his general [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] captured [[Methoni, Messenia|Methone]], a Greek town allied to Antony. However, by the publication of Antony's will, which had been put into his hands by the traitor [[Plancus]] and by carefully letting it be known in Rome what preparations were going on at [[Samos]] and how entirely Antony was acting as the agent of Cleopatra, Octavian produced such a violent outburst of feeling that he easily obtained Antony's deposition from the consulship of 31 BC, for which Antony had been designated. In addition to the deposition, Octavian procured a vote for a proclamation of war against Cleopatra\u2014well understood to mean against Antony, though he was not named.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} In doing this the Senate issued a war declaration and deprived Antony of any legal authority.\n\n==Battle==\nAntony meant to anticipate an attack by a descent upon Italy towards the end of 32 BC, and went as far as [[Corcyra]]. However, finding the sea guarded by a squadron of Octavian's ships, he retired to winter at [[Patrae]] while his fleet for the most part lay in the [[Ambracian Gulf]] and his land forces encamped near the promontory of Actium, while the opposite side of the narrow strait into the Ambracian Gulf was protected by a tower and troops.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nAfter Octavian's proposals for a conference with Antony had been scornfully rejected, both sides prepared for the struggle the next year. The early months passed without notable event, beyond some successes of Agrippa on the coasts of Greece, meant to divert Antony's attention. It was not until the latter part of August that troops were landed in the neighborhood of Antony's camp on the north side of the strait. Still, Antony could not be tempted out. It took some months for his full strength to arrive from the various places in which his allies or his ships had wintered, and during these months not only was Agrippa continuing his descent upon Greek towns and coasts but in various cavalry skirmishes Octavian had so far prevailed, so that Antony abandoned the north side of the strait and confined his soldiers to the southern camp. Cleopatra now earnestly advised that garrisons should be put into strong towns and that the main fleet should return to Alexandria. The large contingent furnished by Egypt gave her advice as much weight as her personal influence over Antony, and it appears that this movement was agreed to.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nOctavian learned of this and debated how to prevent it. At first of a mind to let Antony sail and then attack him, he was prevailed upon by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] to give battle.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 50:31 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#31]</ref> On 1 September he issued an address to his fleet, preparing them for battle. The next day was wet and the sea was rough. When the trumpet signal for the start rang out, Antony's fleet began issuing from the straits and the ships moved into line and remained quiet. Octavian, after a short hesitation, ordered his vessels to steer to the right and pass the enemy's ships. For fear of being surrounded, Antony was forced to give the word to attack.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\n===Order of battle===\n[[File:Battle of Actium-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Order of battle.]]\n\nThe two fleets met outside the [[Gulf of Actium]] (today [[Preveza]]) on the morning of 2 September 31 BC. Antony's fleet numbered 500,{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} of which 230 were large [[warship|war galleys]] with towers full of armed men. He led these through the straits towards the open sea. Octavian had about 250 warships.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sqopAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA781 781]}} His fleet was waiting beyond the straits, led by the experienced admiral Agrippa, commanding from the left wing of the fleet, [[Lucius Arruntius]] the centre<ref name=\"65-66\">[[Plutarch]], ''Antony'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#65 65\u201366;]</ref> and [[Marcus Lurius]] the right.<ref name=\"ii.85\">[[Velleius Paterculus]], ''History of Rome'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#85 ii.85.]</ref> [[Titus Statilius Taurus]]<ref name=\"ii.85\"/> commanded Octavian's armies, and he observed the battle from shore to the north of the straits. Antony and [[Lucius Gellius Publicola (consul 36 BC)|Gellius Publicola]] commanded the right wing of the Antonian fleet, while Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius commanded the center,<ref name=\"65-66\"/> with Cleopatra's squadron positioned behind them. [[Gaius Sosius]] launched the initial attack from the left wing of the fleet, while Antony's chief lieutenant [[Publius Canidius Crassus]] was in command of the triumvir's land forces.<ref name=\"ii.85\"/>\n\n===Combat===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}\n\nIt is estimated that Antony had around 140 ships, as opposed to the 260 ships of Octavian's fleet. What Antony lacked in quantity was made up for in quality (of vessel), as his ships were mainly the standard Roman warship, [[quinquereme]]s with smaller [[quadrireme]]s, heavier and wider than Octavian's, making them ideal weapon platforms.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Antony, 61</ref> Antony's personal flag ship, like those of his admirals, was a \"ten\". An \"eight\" war galley had around 200 heavy marines, archers and at least six ballista catapults. Being larger than Octavian's ships, Antony's war galleys were very difficult to board in close combat and his troops were able to rain down missiles onto their smaller and lower opponent's ships. The bows of the galleys were armored with [[bronze]] plates and square-cut timbers, making a successful ramming attack with similar equipment difficult. The only way to disable such a ship was to smash its oars, rendering it immobile and, hopefully, isolated from the rest of its fleet. The main weakness of Antony's ships was their lack of maneuverability; such a ship, once isolated from support of its fleet, could be swamped with boarding attacks. However, many of his ships were undermanned with rowing crews; there had been a severe malaria outbreak while they were waiting for Octavian's fleet to arrive.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 50:13 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#13]</ref>\n\nOctavian's fleet was largely made up of smaller \"[[Liburna|Liburnian]]\" vessels.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} His ships, although smaller, were still manageable in the heavy surf and could outmaneuver Antony's ships, get in close, attack the above-deck crew with a shower of arrows and ballista-launched stones and retreat.<ref>Dio, Roman History 50.32</ref> Moreover, his crews were better-trained, professional, well fed and rested. A medium ballista was capable of penetrating the sides of most warships at close range and had an effective range of around 200 yards. Most ballista firing was aimed at the marines on the fighting decks of the ships.\n\nBefore the battle one of Antony's generals, [[Quintus Dellius]], had defected to Octavian, bringing with him Antony's battle plans.<ref>Cassius Dio, Roman History [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#23 50.23.1\u20133]</ref>\n\nShortly after midday, Antony was forced to extend his line from the protection of the shore and finally engage the enemy. Seeing this, Octavian's fleet put to sea. Antony had hoped to use his biggest ships to drive back Agrippa's wing on the north end of his line, but Octavian's entire fleet, aware of this strategy, stayed out of range. By about noon the fleets were in formation but Octavian refused to be drawn out, so Antony was forced to attack. The battle raged all afternoon without decisive result.\n\nCleopatra's fleet, in the rear, retreated to the open sea without engaging. A breeze sprang up in the right direction and the Egyptian ships were soon hurrying out of sight.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Lange argues that Antony would have been fighting with victory within reach if it were not for Cleopatra's retreat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lange|first1=Carsten|title=The Battle of Actium: A reconsideration|url=https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/core/journals/classical-quarterly/article/battle-of-actium-a-reconsideration/0DD01E5FBBCA2198FB105C20014F9662|website=Cambridge University Press|publisher=Classical Quarterly|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAntony had not observed the signal, and believing that it was mere panic and all was lost, followed the flying squadron. The contagion spread fast; everywhere sails were seen unfurling and towers and other heavy fighting gear going by the board. Some fought on, and it was not until long after nightfall, when many a ship was blazing from the firebrands thrown upon them, that the work was done.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Making the best of the situation, Antony burned the ships he could no longer man while clustering the remainder tightly together. With many oarsmen dead or unfit to serve, the powerful, head-on ramming tactic for which the Octaries had been designed was now impossible. Antony transferred to a smaller vessel with his flag and managed to escape, taking a few ships with him as an escort to help break through Octavian's lines. Those left behind were captured or sunk.\n\nA differing account of the battle is argued by J.M. Carter. He postulates that Antony knew he was surrounded and had nowhere to run. To try to turn this to his advantage, he gathered his ships around him in a quasi-horseshoe formation, staying close to the shore for safety. Then, should Octavian's ships approach his, the sea would push them into the shore. Antony foresaw that he would not be able to defeat Octavian's forces, so he and Cleopatra stayed in the rear of the formation. Eventually Antony sent the ships on the northern part of the formation to attack. He had them move out to the north, spreading out Octavian's ships, which up until this point were tightly arranged. He sent [[Gaius Sosius]] down to the south to spread the remaining ships out to the south. This left a hole in the middle of Octavian's formation. Antony seized the opportunity and, with Cleopatra on her ship and him on a different ship, sped through the gap and escaped, abandoning his entire force.\n\nWith the end of the battle, Octavian exerted himself to save the crews of the burning vessels and had to spend the whole night on board. The next day, as much of the land army as had not escaped to their own lands, submitted, or were followed in their retreat to Macedonia and forced to surrender, Antony's camp was occupied, bringing an end to the war.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{further|Death of Cleopatra}}\n[[File:Cleopatra VII, marble, Vatican Museums, Pius-Clementine Museum, Room of the Greek Cross 2.jpg|thumb|A (restructured) [[Roman sculpture|Roman statue]] of [[Cleopatra VII]] wearing a [[diadem]] and [[Greco-Roman hairstyle|'melon' hairstyle]] similar to [[Ptolemaic coinage|coinage portraits]], marble, found near the [[:it:Tomba di Nerone|Tomba di Nerone]], Rome along the [[Via Cassia]], [[Museo Pio-Clementino]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Raia|first=Ann R.|last2=Sebesta|first2=Judith Lynn|title=The World of State|publisher=College of New Rochelle|date=September 2017|url=https://www2.cnr.edu/home/sas/araia/state.html|accessdate=2 April 2018|postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lippold |first=Georg |title=Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums |language=German |volume=3 |year=1936 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter & Co |location=Berlin |isbn= |url=http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/arachne/index.php?view[layout]=buch_item&search[constraints][buch][searchSeriennummer]=975 |postscript=. |pages=169-171}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Curtius |first=L. |title=Ikonographische Beitrage zum Portrar der romischen Republik und der Julisch-Claudischen Familie |language=German |journal=RM |volume=48 |year=1933 |url= |isbn= |pages=184 ff.

Under cover of darkness some 19 legions and 12,000 [[cavalry]] fled before Antony was able to engage Octavian in a land battle. Thus, after Antony lost his fleet, his army, which had been equal to that of Octavian, deserted. Antony, though he had not laid down his imperium, was a fugitive and a rebel without that shadow of a legal position which the presence of the consuls and senators had given him in the previous year. Some of the victorious fleet went in pursuit of him; but Octavian himself visited Greece and Asia and spent the winter at Samos, though he was obliged to go for a short time to Brundisium to settle a mutiny and arrange for assignations of land.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nAt [[Samos]] Octavian received a message from [[Cleopatra]] with the present of a gold crown and throne, offering to abdicate in favor of her sons. She was allowed to believe that she would be well treated, for Octavian was anxious to secure her for his triumph. Antony, who had found himself generally deserted, after vainly attempting to secure the army stationed near Paraetonium under Pinarius and sending his eldest son [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus|Antyllus]] with money to Octavian and an offer to live at Athens as a private citizen, found himself in the spring attacked on two sides. [[Cornelius Gallus|C. Cornelius Gallus]] was advancing from Paraetonium and Octavian landed at Pelusium, with the connivance, it was believed, of Cleopatra. Antony was defeated by Gallus and, returning to Egypt, advanced on Pelusium.\n\nDespite a victory at [[Alexandria]] on 31 July 30 BC, more of Antony's men deserted, leaving him with insufficient forces to fight Octavian. A slight success over Octavian's tired soldiers encouraged him to make a general attack, in which he was decisively beaten. Failing to escape on board a ship, he stabbed himself in the stomach upon mistakenly believing false rumors propagated by Cleopatra herself claiming that she had committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Antony and Cleopatra|url=https://www.biography.com/people/groups/mark-antony-and-cleopatra|website=biography.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"pp. 311-312\">[[Plutarch]], ''Antony'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#76 pp. 311-312;]</ref> He did not die at once, and when he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, he insisted on being taken to the mausoleum in which she was hiding, and died in her arms. She was shortly afterwards brought to the palace and vainly attempted to move Octavian to pity.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}}\n\nCleopatra killed herself on 12 August 30 BC. Most accounts say she put an end to her life by the bite of an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] conveyed to her in a basket of figs.{{sfn|Shuckburgh|1917|pp=780-784}} Octavian had [[Caesarion]] killed later that month, finally securing his legacy as Caesar's only 'son'.\n\nOctavian's victory at [[Actium]] gave him sole and uncontested control of \"Mare Nostrum\" (Our Sea, i.e., the Roman Mediterranean) and he became \"Augustus Caesar\" and the \"first citizen\" of Rome. This victory, consolidating his power over every Roman institution, marked the transition of Rome from Republic to Empire.

The male is [[torpedo]]-shaped, with gold stripes between the blue stripes; the female has a larger, whitish belly and silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females exhibit a small [[Fish anatomy#Reproductive system|genital papilla]] in front of the [[anal fin]] origin. The zebrafish can grow to {{convert|6.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, although it seldom grows larger than {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in captivity.

A male must be present for [[ovulation]] and [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of two to three days, laying hundreds of eggs in each [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]. Upon release, embryonic development begins; absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes ''D. rerio'' a convenient research model [[species]].<ref name=beec>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spence R, Gerlach G, Lawrence C, Smith C | title = The behaviour and ecology of the zebrafish, Danio rerio | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201334 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18093234 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00030.x | hdl = 2381/27758 }}</ref>\n\nThe zebrafish embryo develops rapidly, with precursors to all major organs appearing within 36 hours of fertilization.  The embryo begins as a yolk with a single enormous cell on top (see image, 0 h panel), which divides into two (0.75 h panel) and continues dividing until there are thousands of small cells (3.25 h panel).  The cells then migrate down the sides of the yolk (8 h panel) and begin forming a head and tail (16 h panel).  The tail then grows and separates from the body (24 h panel).  The yolk shrinks over time because the fish uses it for food as it matures during the first few days (72 h panel).  After a few months, the adult fish reaches reproductive maturity (bottom panel).\n\nTo encourage the fish to spawn, some researchers use a fish tank with a sliding bottom insert, which reduces the depth of the pool to simulate the shore of a river. Zebrafish spawn best in the morning due to their [[Circadian rhythms]]. Researchers have been able to collect 10,000 embryos in 10 minutes using this method.<ref name=Spawning2012/> Male zebrafish are furthermore known to respond to more pronounced markings on females, i.e., \"good stripes\", but in a group, males will mate with whichever females they can find.

This climactic battle of the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]], was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty for a few decades more.\n\nAs the 20th century approached, Africa had been carved up among the European powers at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The two independent exceptions were the  [[Liberia|Republic of Liberia]] on the west coast and Ethiopia, then still commonly known as Abyssinia, in the eastern Horn of Africa region. The newly unified [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was a relative newcomer to the imperialist [[scramble for Africa]]. Italy had two recently obtained African territories: [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia]]. Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. [[Menelik II]] as the contemporary Ethiopian leader pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend Ethiopia against the Italians.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1889, the Italians signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with then ''[[Negus]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[King]].|group=nb}} [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] of [[Shewa]]. The treaty ceded territories previously part of Ethiopia, namely the provinces of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], [[Serae]], and parts of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]. In return, Italy promised Menelik the second's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a [[protectorate]] of the Kingdom of Italy. The [[Amharic]] version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.<ref>{{cite web | author=Piero Pastoretto | title=Battaglia di Adua | url=http://www.arsmilitaris.org/pubblicazioni/ADUA/adua.htm | accessdate=2006-06-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060531223251/http://www.arsmilitaris.org/pubblicazioni/ADUA/adua.htm |archivedate=31 May 2006 |language=it}}</ref>\n\nThe Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty.  As a result, Italy and Ethiopia faced off in what was later to be known as the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]]. In December 1894, [[Bahta Hagos]] led a rebellion against the Italians in [[Akkele Guzay]], in what was then Italian controlled [[Eritrea]]. Units of General [[Oreste Baratieri]]'s army under Major {{Interlanguage link multi|Pietro Toselli|it}} crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then occupied the [[Tigray Province|Tigrayan]] capital, [[Adwa]]. In January 1895, Baratieri's army went on to defeat [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]] [[Mengesha Yohannes]] in the [[Battle of Coatit]], forcing Mengesha to retreat further south.\n\nBy late 1895, Italian forces had advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 1895, ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[Duke]].|group=nb}} [[Ras Makonnen|Makonnen]], ''Ras'' [[Welle Betul]] and ''Ras'' [[Mengesha Yohannes]] commanding a larger Ethiopian group of Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian unit at the [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1895)|Battle of Amba Alagi]]. The Italians were then forced to withdraw to more defensible positions in [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], where the two main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General [[Oreste Baratieri]], commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] the second's army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.\n\nOn the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera,  met with his [[Brigadier General|brigadiers]] [[Matteo Albertone]], [[Giuseppe Arimondi]], [[Vittorio Dabormida]], and [[Giuseppe Ellena]], concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note,  revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as [[Asmara]]. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale.<ref>Harold G. Marcus, ''The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844\u20131913'', 1975 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 170</ref> Dabormida exclaiming, \"Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat.\" Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00.<ref>David Levering Lewis, ''The Race for Fashoda'' (New York: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), p. 116. {{ISBN|1-55584-058-2}}</ref> His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.\n\n==Forces assembled==\nThe Italian army comprised four [[brigade]]s totaling 17,978 troops, with fifty-six artillery pieces.<ref>Lewis, ''Fashoda'', pp. 116f. He breaks down their numbers into 10,596 Italian officers and soldiers and 7,104 Eritrean askaris.</ref>  However, it is likely that fewer fought in the actual battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that \"several thousand\" soldiers were needed in support roles and to guard the lines of communication to the rear. He accordingly estimates that the Italian force at Adwa consisted of 14,923 effectives.<ref>Marcus, ''Menelik II'', p. 173</ref> One brigade under General Albertone was made up of [[Eritrea]]n [[askari]] led by Italian officers.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, p. 481 ''The Scramble for Africa'', {{ISBN|0-349-10449-2}}</ref> The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. While these included elite [[Bersaglieri]] and [[Alpini]] units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed \"d'Africa\" [[battalion]]s for service in Africa. Additionally a limited number of troops were drafted from the  [[Cacciatori d'Africa]] units of local Italian settlers.<ref name = \"Berkley 1901\">George Fitz-Hardinge Berkley ''The Campaign of Adowa and the rise of Menelik'', London: Constable 1901.</ref><ref>Raffaele Ruggeri, p. 82 ''Le Guerre Coloniali Italiane 1885/1900'', Editrice Militare Italiana 1988</ref>\n\nAs Chris Prouty describes:\n\n{{quote|They [the Italians] had inadequate maps, old-model guns, poor communication equipment and inferior footgear for the rocky ground. (The newer [[Carcano]] Model 91 rifles were not issued because Baratieri, under constraints to be economical, wanted to use up the old cartridges.)

The supporting crossfire each column could give the others made the 'soldiers as deadly as razored shears'. Albertone's brigade was to set the pace for the others. He was to position himself on the summit known as [[Kidane Mehret]], which would give the Italians the high ground from which to meet the Ethiopians.<ref name=\"Lewis-117\"/>}} However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras Alula's position.\n\n[[File:Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam.png|thumb|left|upright|''[[Negus]]'' [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]].]]\nUnbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik knew his troops had exhausted the ability of the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael at the head of the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve.<ref name=\"Lewis-117\">Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 117.</ref> The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.<ref name=\"Casualties\" />\n\nAlbertone's Askari Brigade was the first to encounter the onrush of Ethiopians at 6:00, near Kidane Meret,<ref>In the attached map, this is labelled \"Chidane Meret\", which is immediately above (west) of the hill \"Raj\u00f2\".</ref> where the Ethiopians had managed to set up their mountain artillery. Accounts of the Ethiopian artillery deployed at Adwa differ; Russian advisor [[Leonid Artamonov]] wrote that it comprised forty-two Russian mountain guns supported by a team of fifteen advisers,<ref name=\"vostlit.info\"/> but British writers suggest that the Ethiopian guns were Hotchkiss and Maxim pieces captured from the Egyptians or purchased from French and other European suppliers.<ref>Sean McLachlan, p. 37 \"Armies of the Adowa Campaign 1896\", {{ISBN|978-1-84908-457-4}}</ref> Albertone's heavily outnumbered Askaris held their position for two hours until Albertone's capture, and under Ethiopian pressure the survivors sought refuge with Arimondi's brigade. Arimondi's brigade beat back the Ethiopians who repeatedly charged the Italian position for three hours with gradually fading strength until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 [[Shewa]]ns and swamped the Italian defenders. Two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of Bersaglieri who arrived at the same moment could not help and were cut down.\n\nDabormida's Italian Brigade had moved to support Albertone but was unable to reach him in time. Cut off from the remainder of the Italian Army, Dabormida began a fighting retreat towards friendly positions. However, he inadvertently marched his command into a narrow valley where the Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael slaughtered his brigade, while shouting ''Ebalgume! Ebalgume!'' (\"Reap! Reap!\"). Dabormida's remains were never found, although his brother learned from an old woman living in the area that she had given water to a mortally wounded Italian officer, \"a chief, a great man with spectacles and a watch, and golden stars\".<ref>George Fitz-Hardinge Berkeley, ''Campaign of Adowa'' (1902), quoted in Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 118.</ref>\n\nThe remaining two brigades under Baratieri himself were outflanked and destroyed piecemeal on the slopes of [[Mount Belah]]. Menelik watched as [[Gojjam]] forces under the command of [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymonot]] made quick work of the last intact Italian brigade. By noon, the survivors of the Italian army were in full retreat and the battle was over.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Avanti i mei alpini Adua.jpg|Italian illustration of ''[[Alpini]]'' soldiers at Adwa\nFile:Adoua 1.jpg|British illustration of \"''Dabormida's last rally''\"\nFile:ItaloAbyssinianWarpainting.JPG|Ethiopian painting depicting the battle of Adwa\n</gallery>\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\n[[File:Two Italian soldiers survivors Battle of Adua.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Two [[Italian diaspora|Italian]] soldiers captured and held captive after the Battle of Adwa.]]\n[[File:Tomb Dabormida Adwa.jpg|thumb|220px|Tomb of general Dabormida at Ado Scium Cohena, after the battle of Adwa]] \nThe Italians suffered about 6,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner.

She repeats the opinion of the Italian historian [[Angelo del Boca]], that \"the paucity of the record is attributable to the glacial welcome received in Italy by the returning prisoners for having lost a war, and the fact that they were subjected to long interrogations when they debarked, were defrauded of their back pay, had their mementoes confiscated and were ordered not to talk to journalists\" (p. 170).</ref>\n\nBaratieri was relieved of his command and later charged with preparing an \"inexcusable\" plan of attack and for abandoning his troops in the field. He was acquitted on these charges but was described by the court martial judges as being \"entirely unfit\" for his command.\n\nPublic opinion in Italy was outraged.<ref>Giuseppe Maria Finaldi, ''Italian National Identity in the Scramble for Africa: Italy's African Wars in the Era of Nation-Building, 1870\u20131900'' (2010)</ref> Chris Prouty offers a panoramic overview of the response in Italy to the news:\n{{quote|''When news of the calamity reached Italy there were street demonstrations in most major cities. In Rome, to prevent these violent protests, the universities and theatres were closed. Police were called out to disperse rock-throwers in front of Prime Minister Crispi's residence. Crispi resigned on 9 March. Troops were called out to quell demonstrations in Naples. In Pavia, crowds built barricades on the railroad tracks to prevent a troop train from leaving the station.  The Association of Women of Rome, Turin, Milan and Pavia called for the return of all military forces in Africa. Funeral masses were intoned for the known and unknown dead. Families began sending to the newspapers letters they had received before Adwa in which their menfolk described their poor living conditions and their fears at the size of the army they were going to face. King Umberto declared his birthday (14 March) a day of mourning. Italian communities in [[St. Petersburg]], [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Jerusalem]] collected money for the families of the dead and for the Italian Red Cross.''<ref>Prouty, ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 159f.</ref>}}\n\nThe Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission. The Russian mission was a military mission conceived as a medical support for the Ethiopian troops. It arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menelik's Adwa victory.<ref>[http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/medicine/medicine_6.html The Russian Red Cross Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003141829/http://www.linkethiopia.org/guide/pankhurst/medicine/medicine_6.html |date=3 October 2011 }}</ref> \nIn 1895 Emperor Menelik II invited Leontiev to return to Ethiopia with a Russian military mission.

The victorious Emperor limited his demands to little more than the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Wuchale]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the context of the prevailing balance of power, the emperor's crucial goal was to preserve Ethiopian independence. In addition, Ethiopia had just begun to emerge from a long and brutal [[Famines in Ethiopia|famine]]; Harold Marcus reminds us that the army was restive over its long service in the field, short of rations, and the short rains which would bring all travel to a crawl would soon start to fall.<ref>Marcus, ''Menelik II'', p. 176.</ref> At the time, Menelik claimed a shortage of cavalry horses with which to harry the fleeing soldiers. Chris Prouty observes that \"a failure of nerve on the part of Menelik has been alleged by both Italian and Ethiopian sources.\"<ref>Prouty, ''Empress T'aytu'', p. 161.</ref> Lewis believes that it \"was his farsighted certainty that total annihilation of Baratieri and a sweep into Eritrea would force the Italian people to turn a bungled colonial war into a national crusade\"<ref>Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 120.</ref> that stayed his hand.\n\nAs a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]], recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Almost forty years later, on 3 October 1935, after the [[League of Nations]]'s weak response to the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], the Italians launched a new military campaign endorsed by [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. This time the Italians employed vastly superior military technology such as tanks and aircraft, as well as [[chemical warfare]], and the Ethiopian forces were defeated by May 1936. Following the war, Italy occupied Ethiopia for five years (1936\u201341), before eventually being driven out during World War II by [[British Empire]] and Ethiopian ''Arbegnoch'' (patriot)<ref>{{cite book|first=A.D.|last=Roberts|page=740|title=The Cambridge History of Africa Vol 7|ISBN=0-521-22505-1}}</ref> forces.\n\n== Significance ==\n[[File:Minilk.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II]]]]\n\"The confrontation between Italy and Ethiopia at Adwa was a fundamental turning point in Ethiopian history,\" writes Henze.<ref>Henze, ''Layers of Layers of Time'', p.180.</ref> On a similar note, the Ethiopian historian [[Bahru Zewde]] observed that \"few events in the modern period have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world as has the victory at Adwa\".<ref>Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'' (London: James Currey, 1991), p. 81.</ref>\n\nThe [[Russian Empire]] had sold many artillery pieces to the Ethiopian forces and paid enthusiastic compliments to the Ethiopian success. One of the documents of that time stated \"The Victory immediately gained the general sympathy of Russian society and it continued to grow.\" The unique outlook which polyethnic Russia exhibited to Ethiopia disturbed many supporters of European nationalism during the twentieth century.<ref name=\"RUSSIAN MISSION TO ABYSSINIA\"/><ref name=\"Who Was Count Abai\"/> The Russian [[Cossacks|Cossack]] captain [[Nikolay Leontiev]] with a small escort was present at the battle as an observer.<ref name=\"sworld.com.ua\"/><ref>[http://www.tvoros.ru/proza/kazaki-u-imperatora-menelika-vtorogo.html Cossacks of the emperor Menelik II]</ref>\n\nThis defeat of a colonial power and the ensuing recognition of African sovereignty became rallying points for later African nationalists during their struggle for decolonization, as well as activists and leaders of the [[Pan-African]] movement.<ref>Professor [[Kinfe Abraham]], \"The Impact of the Adowa Victory on The Pan-African and Pan-Black Anti-Colonial Struggle,\" Address delivered to The [[Institute of Ethiopian Studies]], Addis Ababa University, 8 February 2006</ref> As the [[Afrocentric]] scholar Molefe Asante explains,\n{{quote|After the victory over Italy in 1896, Ethiopia acquired a special importance in the eyes of Africans as the only surviving African State. After Adowa, Ethiopia became emblematic of African valor and resistance, the bastion of prestige and hope to thousands of Africans who were experiencing the full shock of European conquest and were beginning to search for an answer to the myth of African inferiority.<ref>Molefe Asante, quoted in Rodney Worrell, ''Pan-africanism in Barbados'', (New Academia Publishing: 2005) p. 16</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, many writers have pointed out how this battle was a humiliation for the Italian military. Italian historian Tripodi pinpointed that some of the roots of the rise of [[Fascism]] in Italy went back to this defeat and to the need to \"avenge\" the defeat that started to be present in the military and nationalistic groups of the Kingdom of Italy. The same [[Mussolini]] literally declared when Italian troops occupied [[Addis Abeba]] in May 1936: ''Adua e' vendicata'' (Adwa has been avenged).\n\nIndeed, one student of Ethiopia's History, Donald N. Levine, points out that for the Italians Adwa \"became a [[national trauma]] which demagogic leaders strove to avenge. It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935\". Levine also noted that the victory \"gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West \u2013 resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/[[Haile Selassie]] would have to contend\".<ref>[http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2009/03/the-battle-of-adwa-as-a-historic-event/ \"The Battle of Adwa as a 'Historic' Event\"], ''[[Ethiopian Review]]'', 3 March 2009 (Retrieved 9 March 2009)</ref>\n\n== Contemporary celebrations of Adwa ==\n===Public holiday===\nThe Victory of Adwa is a public holiday in all regional states and [[charter cities]] across Ethiopia.

In [[Addis Ababa]], the Victory of Adwa is celebrated at [[Menelik Square]] with the presence of government officials, patriots, foreign diplomats and the general public. Ethiopian Police Orchestra play various patriotic songs as they walk around Menelik Square.<ref name=\"borkena.com\">https://www.borkena.com/2018/03/02/adwa-victory-colorfully-celebrated-addis-ababa/</ref>\n\nThe public dress up in traditional Ethiopian patriotic attire. Men often wear [[Jodhpurs]] pants, various types of vest tops, and carry the Ethiopian flag, various patriotic banners and placards, and traditional Ethiopian shields and swords called [[Shotel]]. Women dress up in different patterns of handcrafted traditional [[Ethiopian clothing]], known in [[Amharic]] as [[Habesha kemis]]. Some wear black gowns on top, while others put royal crowns on their head. Women's dressing style, like their male counterparts, imitate the traditional style of Ethiopian patriotic women. Of particular note is the dominant presence of Empress [[Taytu Betul]] during these celebrations.<ref name=\"aglobalworld.com\"/><ref name=\"borkena.com\"/>\n\nEmpress [[Taytu Betul]] is the beloved and influential wife of Emperor [[Menelik II]], who played a significant role during the Battle of Adwa. Although often overlooked, thousands of women fought during the Battle of Adwa alongside men. Some were trained as nurses to attend to the wounded, while others mainly cooked and supplied food and water to the soldiers and comforted the wounded.<ref name=\"borkena.com\"/>\n\nIn addition to [[Addis Ababa]], other major cities in Ethiopia, including [[Bahir Dar]], [[Debre Markos]] and the town of [[Adwa]] itself, where the Battle of Adwa took place, celebrate the Victory of Adwa in public ceremonies.<ref name=\"aglobalworld.com\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nSeveral images and symbols are used during the commemoration of the Victory of Adwa, including the tri-coloured Green, Gold and Red Ethiopian flag, images of [[Emperor]] [[Menelik II]] and [[Empress]] [[Taytu Betul]], as well as other prominent kings and war generals of the time including [[King]] [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]], [[Michael of Wollo|King Michael]] of [[Wollo]], [[Dejazmach]] [[Balcha Safo]], [[Fitawrari]] [[Habte Giyorgis Dinagde]], and [[Fitawrari]] [[Gebeyehu]], among others. Surviving members of the Ethiopian patriotic battalions wear the various medals that they collected for their participation during different battle fields. Young people often wear T-shirts adorned by Emepror [[Menelik II]], Empress [[Taytu]], Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] and other notable members of the Ethiopian monarchy. Popular and [[patriotic songs]] are often played on amplifiers. Of particular note are [[Ejigayehu Shibabaw]]\u2019s [[ballad]] dedicated to the Battle of Adwa and [[Teddy Afro]]\u2019s popular song \u201cTikur Sew\u201d, which literally translates to \u201cblack man or black person\u201d \u2013 a poetic reference to Emperor [[Menelik II]]\u2019s decisive African victory over Europeans, as well as the Emperor's darker skin complexion.\n\n== Film ==\n* [[Adwa (film)|''Adwa'']] \u2013 1999 documentary film directed by [[Haile Gerima]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Battle of Annual]]\n* [[Battle of Isandlwana]]\n* [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]\n* [[Russo-Japanese War]]\n* [[Massacre of Elphinstone's Army]]\n* [[St. Clair's Defeat]]\n\n== Notes ==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|2|group=nb}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Berkeley, G.F.-H.

Balls marked \"1\" and \"3\" are in the two stable positions, while ball 2 is at the point of unstable equilibrium between them.]]\n\n'''Bistability''', with two [[stable equilibrium (disambiguation)|stable equilibrium states]] co-exist in a [[dynamical system]], is a fundamental phenomenon in nature<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Guanyu|date=|title=Optimal homeostasis necessitates bistable control|url=|journal=J R Soc Interface|volume=9|pages=2723-2734|via=}}</ref>.  A bistable system possesses miscellaneous fine properties such as memory production, robustness to noise, hysteresis adaptivity. But the overarching principle underlying all these fine properties, as recently found, is that bistability confers optimal homeostasis of chemical or physiological concentrations <ref name=\":0\" />.  \n\nSomething that is '''bistable''' can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to [[Energy storage|stored energy]].  In terms of [[potential energy]], a bistable system has two [[local minimum|local minima]] of potential energy separated by a peak (local maximum). An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a [[light switch]]. The switch lever is designed to rest in the \"on\" or \"off\" position, but not between the two.\n\nIn a [[conservative force]] field, bistability stems from the fact that the [[potential energy]] has three [[equilibrium point]]s. Two of them are [[minimum|minima]] and one is a [[maximum]].  By mathematical arguments, the maximum must lie between the two minima.  At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them.\n\nA system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare [[activation energy]] and [[Arrhenius equation]] for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the other minimum state in a time called the [[relaxation time]].\n\nBistability is widely used in [[digital electronics]] devices to store [[binary number|binary]] data. It is the essential characteristic of the [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], a circuit widely used in latches and some types of [[semiconductor memory]].  A bistable device can store one [[binary digit|bit]] of binary data, with one state representing a \"0\" and the other state a \"1\".  It is also used in [[relaxation oscillator]]s, [[multivibrator]]s, and the [[Schmitt trigger]].\n[[Optical bistability]] is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input.\nBistability can also arise in biochemical systems, where it creates digital, switch-like outputs from the constituent chemical concentrations and activities. It is often associated with [[Hysteresis#In biology|hysteresis]] in such systems.\n\n==Mathematical modelling==\n\nIn the mathematical language of [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamic systems analysis]], one of the simplest bistable systems is\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = y (1-y^2).\n</math>\n\nThis system describes a ball rolling down a curve with shape <math>\\frac{y^4}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{2}</math>, and has three steady-states: <math> y = 1 </math>, <math> y = 0 </math>, and <math> y = -1</math>. The middle steady-state <math>y=0</math> is unstable, while the other two states are stable. The direction of change of <math>y(t)</math> over time depends on the initial condition <math>y(0)</math>.  If the initial condition is positive (<math>y(0)>0</math>), then the solution <math>y(t)</math> approaches 1 over time, but if the initial condition is negative (<math>y(0)< 0</math>), then <math>y(t)</math> approaches \u22121 over time. Thus, the dynamics are \"bistable\". The final state of the system can be either <math> y = 1 </math> or <math> y = -1 </math>, depending on the initial conditions.<ref>For detailed techniques of mathematical modelling of bistability, see the tutorial by Chong et al.

Brandman, J. E 2005\"/>\n\nBistability can also arise in a biochemical system only for a particular range of parameter values, where the parameter can often be interpreted as the strength of the feedback. In several typical examples, the system has only one stable fixed point at low values of the parameter. A [[saddle-node bifurcation]] gives rise to a pair of new fixed points emerging, one stable and the other unstable, at a critical value of the parameter. The unstable solution can then form another saddle-node bifurcation with the initial stable solution at a higher value of the parameter, leaving only the higher fixed solution. Thus, at values of the parameter between the two critical values, the system has two stable solutions. An example of a dynamical system that demonstrates similar features is\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = r + \\frac{x^5}{1+x^5} - x\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>x</math> is the output, and <math>r</math> is the parameter, acting as the input.<ref name=\"Angeli 2003\">{{cite journal| author1 = Angeli, David| author2=Ferrell, JE| author3=Sontag, Eduardo D| title=Detection of multistability, bifurcations, and hysteresis in a large calss of biological positive-feedback systems| journal=PNAS| year=2003| volume=101| issue=7| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/7/1822| doi=10.1073/pnas.0308265100| pmid=14766974| pmc=357011| pages=1822\u20137}}</ref>\n\nBistability can be modified to be more robust and to tolerate significant changes in concentrations of reactants, while still maintaining its \"switch-like\" character.  Feedback on both the activator of a system and inhibitor make the system able to tolerate a wide range of concentrations.  An example of this in cell biology is that activated CDK1 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1) activates its activator Cdc25 while at the same time inactivating its inactivator, Wee1, thus allowing for progression of a cell into mitosis.  Without this double feedback, the system would still be bistable, but would not be able to tolerate such a wide range of concentrations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ferrell JE Jr.|title=Feedback regulation of opposing enzymes generates robust, all-or-none bistable responses|journal=Current Biology|year=2008|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&_cid=272099&_user=10&_pii=S0960982208001814&_check=y&_origin=&_coverDate=25-Mar-2008&view=c&wchp=dGLzVlV-zSkzk&md5=68c1e4cd1871b9bbf09f2ade972e0d04/1-s2.0-S0960982208001814-main.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.035|pages=R244\u2013R245|pmid=18364225|pmc=2832910}}</ref>\n\nBistability has also been described in the embryonic development of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' (the fruit fly).

Shh functions in diverse processes in development, including patterning limb bud tissue differentiation. The Shh signaling network behaves as a bistable switch, allowing the cell to abruptly switch states at precise Shh concentrations. ''gli1'' and ''gli2'' transcription is activated by Shh, and their gene products act as transcriptional activators for their own expression and for targets downstream of Shh signaling.<ref>Lai, K., M.J. Robertson, and D.V. Schaffer, The sonic hedgehog signaling system as a bistable genetic switch. Biophys J, 2004. 86(5): p. 2748-57.</ref> Simultaneously, the Shh signaling network is controlled by a negative feedback loop wherein the Gli transcription factors activate the enhanced transcription of a repressor (Ptc). This signaling network illustrates the simultaneous positive and negative feedback loops whose exquisite sensitivity helps create a bistable switch.\n\nBistability can only arise in biological and chemical systems if three necessary conditions are fulfilled: positive [[feedback]], a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent increase without bound.<ref name=Wilhelm/>\n\nBistable chemical systems have been studied extensively to analyze relaxation kinetics, [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], [[stochastic resonance]], as well as [[climate change]].<ref name=Wilhelm/> In bistable spatially extended systems the onset of local correlations and propagation of traveling waves have been analyzed.<ref name=Elf>{{cite journal |last1 = Elf |first1 = J. | last2 = Ehrenberg| first2 = M. |year = 2004 |title = Spontaneous separation of bi-stable biochemical systems into spatial domains of opposite phases |journal = Systems Biology (Stevenage) |volume = 1 |number = 2| pages = 230\u2013236 |pmid = 17051695 | doi=10.1049/sb:20045021}}</ref><ref name=Kochanzyck>{{cite journal |last1 = Kochanczyk |first1 = M. |last2 = Jaruszewicz |first2 = J. |last3 = Lipniacki |first3 = T. |title = Stochastic transitions in a bistable reaction system on the membrane |journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume = 10 |number = 84 |pages = 20130151 |pmid = 23635492 |pmc = 3673150 |doi =  10.1098/rsif.2013.0151 |date=Jul 2013}}</ref>\n\nBistability is often accompanied by [[hysteresis]].

In an ensemble average over the population, the result may simply look like a smooth transition, thus showing the value of single-cell resolution.\n\n== In mechanical systems ==\nBistability is the ability of a material to present in two stable phases that can both exist within a given range of temperatures but above and below that range only one or the other phase exists.\n\nBistability as applied in the design of mechanical systems is more commonly said to be \"over centre\"\u2014that is, work is done on the system to move it just past the peak, at which point the mechanism goes \"over centre\" to its secondary stable position. The result is a toggle-type action- work applied to the system below a threshold sufficient to send it 'over center' results in no change to the mechanism's state.\n\n[[spring (device)|Springs]] are a common method of achieving an \"over centre\" action. A spring attached to a simple two position ratchet-type mechanism can create a button or plunger that is clicked or toggled between two mechanical states. Many [[Ballpoint Pen|ballpoint]] and [[Rollerball Pen|rollerball]] retractable pens employ this type of bistable mechanism.\n\nAn even more common example of an over-center device is an ordinary electric wall switch.  These switches are often designed to snap firmly into the \"on\" or \"off\" position once the toggle handle has been moved a certain distance past the center-point.\n\nA [[ratchet (device)|ratchet-and-pawl]] is an elaboration\u2014a multi-stable \"over center\" system used to create irreversible motion.  The pawl goes over center as it is turned in the forward direction. In this case, \"over center\" refers to the ratchet being stable and \"locked\" in a given position until clicked forward again; it has nothing to do with the ratchet being unable to turn in the reverse direction.\n\n[[File:Ratchet example.gif|thumbnail|A ratchet in action.

The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world. He is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2005.\n* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in [[PDF]] format on ''Scientific American'''s site.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF \"Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg\u2019s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)\"].

They were sold by [[Arab]] traders to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]s for exorbitant prices. The traders did not divulge the exact location of their source and no European was able to deduce their location.\n\nThe first written accounts of Banda are in ''Suma Oriental'', a book written by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[apothecary]] [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] who was based in [[Malacca]] from 1512 to 1515 but visited Banda several times. On his first visit, he interviewed the Portuguese and the far more knowledgeable Malay sailors in Malacca. He estimated the early sixteenth century population to be 2500\u20133000. He reported the Bandanese as being part of an Indonesia-wide trading network and the only native Malukan long-range traders taking cargo to Malacca, although shipments from Banda were also being made by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders.\n\nIn addition to the production of nutmeg and mace, Banda maintained significant [[entrep\u00f4t]] trade; goods that moved through Banda included cloves from [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the north, [[bird-of-paradise]] feathers from the [[Aru Islands]] and western [[New Guinea]], ''massoi'' bark for traditional medicines and salves. In exchange, Banda predominantly received rice and cloth; namely light cotton ''[[batik]]'' from [[Java]], ''[[Calico (textile)|calicoes]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[ikat]]'' from the [[Lesser Sundas]].  In 1603, an average quality ''[[sarong]]''-sized cloth traded for eighteen kilograms of nutmeg.  Some of these textiles were then on-sold, ending up in [[Halmahera]] and [[New Guinea]].

In November of that year, after having secured Malacca and learning of the Bandas' location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his good friend [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] to find them.

Five of the Banda islands were within gunshot of each other and he realised that a fort on the main island Neira would give him full control of the group. The Bandanese were, however, hostile to such a plan, and their warlike antics were both costly and tiresome to Garcia whose men were attacked when they attempted to build a fort.

Ironically though, it was this lack of ports which brought the Dutch to trade at Banda instead of the clove islands of Ternate and Tidore.\n\n===Dutch Control===\n{{main|Governorate of the Banda Islands}}\n[[File:Fort Nassau 1646.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]] in 1646]]\n\nThe Dutch followed the Portuguese to Banda but were to have a much more dominating and lasting presence. Dutch-Bandanese relations were mutually resentful from the outset, with Holland\u2019s first merchants complaining of Bandanese reneging on agreed deliveries and price, and cheating on quantity and quality. For the Bandanese, on the other hand, although they welcomed another competitor purchaser for their spices, the items of trade offered by the Dutch\u2014heavy woolens, and damasks, unwanted manufactured goods, for example\u2014were usually unsuitable in comparison to traditional trade products. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Arab]] and [[India]]n, and Portuguese traders for example brought indispensable items along with steel knives, copper, medicines and prized [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAs much as the Dutch disliked dealing with the Bandanese, the trade was a highly profitable one with spices selling for 300 times the purchase price in Banda. This amply justified the expense and risk in shipping them to Europe. The allure of such profits saw an increasing number of Dutch expeditions; it was soon seen that in trade with the East Indies, competition from each would eat into all their profits. Thus the competitors united to form the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)'' (the \u2018[[Dutch East Indies Company]]) in 1602.<ref name = \"uclwxl\">Hannard (1991)</ref>\n\nUntil the early seventeenth century the Bandas were ruled by a group of leading citizens, the ''orang kaya'' (literally 'rich men'); each of these was head of a district. At the time nutmeg was one of the \"fine spices\" kept expensive in Europe by disciplined manipulation of the market, but a desirable commodity for Dutch traders in the ports of India as well; economic historian [[Fernand Braudel]] notes that India consumed twice as much as Europe.<ref>Braudel 1984, p. 219</ref> A number of Banda\u2019s ''orang kaya'' were persuaded by the Dutch to sign a treaty granting the Dutch a monopoly on spice purchases. Even though the Bandanese had little understanding of the significance of the treaty known as 'The Eternal Compact', or that not all Bandanese leaders had signed, it would later be used to justify Dutch troops being brought in to defend their monopoly.\n\nIn April 1609, Admiral [[Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff]] arrived at Banda Neira with a request by [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] to build a fort on the island (the eventual [[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]]). The Bandanese were not excited about this idea. On May 22, before building of the fort had started, the ''orang kaya'' called a meeting with the Dutch admiral, purportedly to negotiate prices. Instead, they led Verhoeff and two high-ranked men into an ambush and decapitated them and subsequently killed 46 of the Dutch visitors. [[Jan Pietersz Coen]], who was a lower-ranked merchant on the expedition, managed to escape, but the traumatic event likely influenced his future attitude towards the Bandanese.<ref>Opstall, M.E. van, ''De reis van de vloot van Pieter Willemsz Verhoeff naar Azi\u00eb 1607\u20131612'', Utrecht University, 1972, pp. 95\u201398.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Belgica 1824.jpg|thumb|Fort Belgica in 1824]]\n\n===English-Dutch rivalry===\nWhile Portuguese and Spanish activity in the region had weakened, the English had built fortified trading posts on tiny Ai and [[Run (island)|Run]] islands, ten to twenty kilometres from the main Banda Islands. With the English paying higher prices, they were significantly undermining Dutch aims for a monopoly. As Anglo-Dutch tensions increased in 1611 the Dutch built the larger and more strategic [[Fort Belgica]] above Fort Nassau.\n\nIn 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai with 900 men whereupon the English retreated to Run where they regrouped.

These land parcels were then handed to Dutch planters known as ''perkeniers'' of which 34 were on [[Lontar island|Lontar]], 31 on Ai and 3 on Neira.  With few Bandanese left to work them, slaves from elsewhere  were brought in. Now enjoying control of the nutmeg production, the VOC paid the ''perkeniers'' 1/122nd of the Dutch market price for nutmeg; however, the ''perkeniers'' still profited immensely building substantial villas with opulent imported European decorations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe outlying island of Run was harder for the VOC to control and they exterminated all nutmeg trees there. The production and export of nutmeg was a VOC monopoly for almost two hundred years. [[Fort Belgica]], one of many forts built by the [[Dutch East India Company]], is one of the largest remaining European forts in Indonesia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n===English-Dutch rivalry continues===\nThough not physically present at the Banda Islands, the English claimed the small island of [[Run (island)|Run]] until 1667 when, under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]], the Dutch and English agreed to maintain the colonial [[status quo]] and relinquish their respective claims.\n\nIn 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was a vassal of Napoleonic France and hence in conflict with Britain.  The French and British were each seeking to control lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes.  On 10 May 1810, a squadron consisting of the 36-gun frigate ''[[HMS Caroline]]'', formerly French frigate ''[[French frigate Pi\u00e9montaise (1804)|HMS Piedmontaise]]'', 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|sloop]] ''[[HMS Barracouta]]'', and the 12-gun transport ''[[HMS Mandarin (1810)|HMS Mandarin]]'' left [[Chennai|Madras]] with money, supplies and troops to support the garrison at [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]], recently captured from the Dutch.  The frigates and sloop carried a hundred officers and men of the [[102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers)|Madras European Regiment]], while the ''Mandarin'' carried supplies.  The squadron was commanded by Captain [[Christopher Cole (Royal Navy officer)|Christopher Cole]], with Captain Charles Foote on the ''Piedmontaise'' and Captain Richard Kenah aboard the ''Barracouta''.  After departing from Madras, Cole informed Foote and Kenah of Cole's plan to capture the Bandas; Foote and Kenah agreed.

Founded in April 1988, the Broncos play in Australia's elite competition, the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership. They have won six premierships, including two NSWRL titles, a Super League premiership and three NRL premierships. They also have two [[World Club Challenge]]s. The Broncos have achieved four [[minor premiership]]s during their 29 years in multiple competitions, making them Rugby League's most successful club over the past three decades. Until 2015, Brisbane had never been defeated in a [[grand final]], and since 1991, have only failed to qualify for the finals twice. They are the most successful club in the National Rugby League, since it began in 1998, winning three premierships. It is also one of the most successful clubs in the history of rugby league, having won 62.5% of games played since its induction in 1988, second only to Melbourne Storm with 65.2%. Since the club's founding, Brisbane has never received the wooden spoon.\n\nThe club records the highest annual revenue of all NRL clubs \u2013 $A32.8m for the 2012 financial year \u2013 and is one of the most valuable clubs of any code in Australia, worth over $42 million.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Lanigan \n |first=Louise \n |title=Brisbane Broncos Annual Financial Report for 2012 \n |work=Brisbane Broncos Limited \n |location=Brisbane \n |page=61 \n |publisher=Ernest and Young \n |date=21 February 2013 \n |url=http://www.broncos.com.au/site/_content/document/00003777-source.pdf \n |accessdate=5 May 2013 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511033652/http://www.broncos.com.au/site/_content/document/00003777-source.pdf \n |archivedate=11 May 2013 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Along with financial competitiveness, the Broncos have been voted one of Australia's most popular and most watched football teams,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Heming\n  | first = Wayne\n  | title = Brisbane Broncos voted Australia's most popular football team\n  | work = foxsports.com.au\n  | location =\n  | pages =\n  | publisher = AAP\n  | date = 30 October 2009\n| url = http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,26281418-23214,00.html\n  | accessdate = 31 October 2009}}</ref> and has one of the highest average attendances of any [[rugby football|rugby]] league club in the world; 33,337 in the [[NRL 2012|2012 NRL season]].\n\nThe club was founded in April 1988 as part of the [[Winfield Cup]]'s national expansion, becoming, along with the [[Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]], one of Queensland's first two participants in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]. The Broncos later became the dominant force in the competition before playing a significant role in the [[Super League War]] of the mid-1990s, then continuing to compete successfully in the newly created National Rugby League competition. The Broncos are based in the Brisbane suburb of [[Red Hill, Queensland|Red Hill]] where their training ground and Leagues club are located, but they play their home games at [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium|Lang Park]].  It is the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}).\n\nThe club's current head coach is former Queensland and Australia coach, Wayne Bennett, who has been widely regarded as one of the best coaches of all time and holds many Australian coaching records for the most grand final wins. In 2000, the Brisbane Broncos won their 5th NRL premiership with Wayne Bennett. In 1988, he was the Broncos coach before moving to the St George-Illawarra Dragons in 2009.

After a Cowboys try, [[Johnathan Thurston]] had missed a match winning [[Rugby league gameplay|try conversion]] after the 80 minutes, kick off was given to the Broncos, with a promising chance to the Broncos, only resulting in a knock-on by Bronco's Half-Back, Ben Hunt.

The state flower the [[Cooktown Orchid]] and the [[Poinsettia]] which had long been used by Brisbane representative teams in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] and midweek knockout competitions was also ruled out, along with other [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] such as the [[brumby]], [[Phalangeriformes|possum]], [[galah]] and the [[kookaburra]], which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen [[Paddle steamer|paddleships]].<ref name=\"broncsteamtobeat\">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat | publisher=University of Queensland Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-7022-3275-0}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted to continue with the use of [[alliteration]] for local sporting teams such as the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and [[Brisbane Bears]] (later the [[Brisbane Lions]]), the club's directors eventually decided on the nickname [[Bronco]]s.<ref name=\"broncshistory\" />This name was chosen by [[Barry Maranta]] because he was a fan of NFL team, [[Denver Broncos]]. [[The Australian]] newspaper has described the name as \"Mystifyingly American\".<ref>http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/the-maleficent-seven-these-are-our-least-lovable-sports-teams/story-fnlpdory-1226850856983</ref>\n\nThe original club logo was first featured in the Broncos' inaugural season in the premiership in 1988 and was used until 1999. It used a mostly gold colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more maroon design, which was much closer to the traditional colour associated with Queensland rugby league and Queensland sport in general.<ref name=\"fabulous\" /> This design continues to be used to date.\n\nTraditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been maroon, white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially, the founders of the club favored the official blue and gold colours of [[Brisbane City Council]]. However, Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] advised the board that \"Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century.\"<ref name=\"broncsteamtobeat\" /> As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Queensland along with gold, symbolizing the Queensland sunshine,\n<ref name=\"broncsteamtobeat\" /> were adopted as the club's colours.\n\nIn the inaugural [[1988 Brisbane Broncos season|1988 season]], the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white and the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and the maroon of the [[Queensland rugby league team]].<ref name=\"broncs1908\" /> Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favor of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.<ref name=\"fabulous\" />\n\nAt the 1995 [[Rugby League World Sevens]] tournament, the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours \u2013 mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it \"will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours.\"<ref>Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995</ref> In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly white with navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], Melbourne Storm and [[New Zealand Warriors]]. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favor of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003.<ref name=\"fabulous\" />\n\n[[International Sports Clothing]] became Brisbane's kit provider in October 2016, replacing long-time suppliers [[Nike, Inc|Nike]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iscsport.com/blog/isc-announces-partnership-with-brisbane-broncos/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221053143/http://www.iscsport.com/blog/isc-announces-partnership-with-brisbane-broncos/ |archive-date=21 December 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Home jersey used by the Brisbane Broncos\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Brisbane Broncos home jersey 2013.png|2013\u20132014\n</gallery>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Brisbane Broncos Stadiums}}\n[[Image:Suncorpstadium071006.JPG|thumb|250px|right|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, Suncorp Stadium.]]\nIn their first five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 52,500 capacity [[Lang Park]] (or more commonly referred to as \"Suncorp Stadium\" due to sponsorship of Suncorp, Australia), the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict with the QRL having a commercial agreement with [[Castlemaine XXXX]] brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers who were not permitted any permanent signs (the Broncos initially got around this by not using the change rooms at half time during games, instead sitting on the ground with a temporary protective banner surrounding them which just happened to have prominent Powers logos), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]).<ref name=\"broncs1908\"/> The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season.<ref name = \"broncscrowd\"/> However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712.

Queensland Cowboys}}\n\nThe Broncos biggest rivals are the North Queensland Cowboys. The two clubs had a long-standing 'sibling rivalry' with the Cowboys characterised as the underdog. The rivalry increased in intensity after the Cowboys won their first premiership, beating the Broncos at the 2015 Grand Final at [[ANZ Stadium]]. [[2015 NRL Grand Final|Considered one of the greatest grand finals of all time]], the win established the Cowboys as competitive equals. Between 2015 and 2017 a staggering 3 of 5 of the games played between the two clubs led to a Golden Point finish. It is regarded as one of the greatest sports rivalries and is considered the fiercest rivalry by far in the NRL, earning the nickname of the \"[[Queensland derby]]\".\n\n=== Sydney Roosters ===\n{{Main|Sydney Roosters}}\n\nSince the 2000 Grand Final between the Roosters and Broncos, both clubs have built on a rivalry which still continues today. From 2002 to 2010, the Roosters and the Broncos played in the traditional Good Friday match.\n\n=== Gold Coast Titans ===\n{{Main|Gold Coast Titans}}\n\nThe rivalry remains due to the fact that the Titans are geographically the closest club to the Broncos. Brisbane previously enjoyed the rivalry with the [[Gold Coast Chargers]], until the Chargers exited the competition at the end of 1998 season, returning as the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in 2007.\n\n== Club affiliations ==\nThe Brisbane Broncos have five split feeder clubs from the Queensland Cup ([[Redcliffe Dolphins]], [[Ipswich Jets]], [[Norths Devils|Northern Suburbs Devils]], [[Souths Logan Magpies]] and [[Wynnum Manly Seagulls|Wynnum-Manly Seagulls]], making the Broncos the only club with more than three affiliated feeder clubs. Former feeder clubs of the Broncos were [[Aspley Broncos]] and [[Toowoomba Clydesdales]] and [[Burleigh Bears]], who switched to the [[Gold Coast Titans]].\n\n== Club victory song ==\nThe Broncos' victory song, \"We're The Broncos\":\n\n'''We\u2019re the Broncos'''\n\n'''The mighty Broncos'''\n\n'''We keep fighting every second till the end'''\n\n'''We\u2019re the Broncos'''\n\n'''The greatest team on earth'''\n\n'''We\u2019re the heart of all Queensland'''\n\n'''Never stop'''\n\n'''We never rest'''\n\n'''On and on we beat the best'''\n\n'''Never giving up we bleed maroon and gold'''\n\n'''For the league'''\n\n'''We risk it all'''\n\n'''Miles above'''\n\n'''We\u2019re standing tall'''\n\n'''We\u2019re the finest and the greatest club of all'''\n\n'''We\u2019re the Broncos'''\n\n'''The mighty Broncos'''\n\n'''We keep fighting every second till the end'''\n\n'''We breathe in our soul'''\n\n'''The best game of all'''\n\n'''We are the Broncos of Queensland'''\n\n'''Hey!!'''\n\n==NRL Women's team==\nIn 2017, the Brisbane Broncos launched a bid to enter a team in the inaugural [[NRL Women's Premiership]] in [[2018 NRL Women's season|2018]].

'''Brisbane Lions''' is a professional [[Australian rules football in Australia|Australian rules football]] club which plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). The club is based in [[Brisbane]], Queensland, [[Australia]]. The club was formed in late 1996 from the merger of the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] and the [[Brisbane Bears]]. The Lions are one of the most successful AFL clubs of the 21st century, having appeared in four consecutive [[AFL Grand Final]]s from [[2001 AFL season|2001]] to [[2004 AFL season|2004]] and winning three premierships (2001, 2002, 2003).\n\nThe club is based at [[the Gabba]]. The team is captained by [[Dayne Zorko]] and coached by [[Chris Fagan (Australian footballer)|Chris Fagan]].\n\n== History: Start of a new era ==\n{{Main|History of the Brisbane Lions}}\nThe Brisbane Lions were officially launched on 1 November 1996, joining the national competition in 1997.\n\n=== Beginnings: 1997\u20132000 ===\nIn their first year as a combined club the Lions made the finals, finishing in eighth position after being defeated by the [[St Kilda Football Club]] in a qualifying final. The following year, however, they finished in last position, despite boasting a talented playing list.\n\n=== Triple premiership success: 2001\u20132003 ===\n[[File:MichaelVoss.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Michael Voss]] captained Brisbane to three successive premierships.]]\nAs the Brisbane Lions, the club won its first AFL premiership in the [[2001 AFL Grand Final]], defeating [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 15.18 (108) to 12.10 (82).<ref>{{cite web| title=AFL Clubs| publisher=AFL| url=http://cms.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/AFL_Clubs.pdf| accessdate=30 June 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Eflorg1K?url=http://cms.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/AFL_Clubs.pdf| archivedate=24 February 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lions utility player [[Shaun Hart]] won the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best on ground in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]].<ref name=GF>{{Cite book| last=Lovett| first=Michael (Chief editor)| title=AFL Record Season Guide| publisher=Geoff Slattery Media Group| year=2010| isbn=978-0-9806274-5-9}}</ref>{{rp|521}}\n\nIn 2002, the Lions won back-to-back premierships when they defeated [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] 9.12 (66) to 10.15 (75) in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final]] in cold and wet conditions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Early in the contest the Lions lost both ruckman Beau McDonald and utility player Martin Pike (who had already had nine possessions in the first quarter) to injury and had to complete the match with a limited bench.\n\nIn 2003, the Lions would win their 3rd premiership in a row, and second in a row against the [[Collingwood Magpies]]. With a number of players under an injury cloud \u2013 and having lost to Collingwood in a qualifying final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground three weeks previously \u2013 the Lions went into the game as underdogs. However, they sealed their place in history as an AFL dynasty by thrashing the Magpies in cool but sunny conditions. At one stage in the final quarter the Lions led by almost 80 points before relaxing when the match was well and truly won, allowing Collingwood to score the last four goals. The final score of 20.14 (134) to 12.12 (84)<ref name=GF />{{rp|860}} saw the club become only the fourth in VFL/AFL history to win three consecutive premierships and the first since the creation of the AFL. Simon Black claimed the Norm Smith Medal with a dominant 39 possession match, the most possessions ever gathered by a player in a grand final.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Blake| first=Martin| title=Black right on the ball|work=The Age |location=Australia| date=28 September 2003| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/27/1064083247266.html| accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 2004 season saw Brisbane remain in the top portion of the ladder for most of the season. Reaching the finals in second position, Brisbane controversially had to travel to Melbourne to play against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] in the preliminary final, due to a contract between the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) and the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) that required one preliminary final to be played each year at the MCG.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/fairer-finals-clause-comes-back-to-bite-afl-20140815-104ok3.html|title=Fairer finals clause comes back to bite AFL|first=Caroline|date=15 August 2014|last=Wilson}}</ref> [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] had finished on top of the ladder and hosted the other preliminary final in Adelaide.

That year, the Lions failed to make the finals for a third successive year in 2007.\n\nThe Lions began the [[2008 NAB Cup]] shakily, losing to Essendon by 27 points. The team struggled for the season and missed out on the finals with a 10\u201312 record, losing 3 games despite having at least 5 more scoring shots in each of those games. Coach Leigh Matthews resigned at the end of the season after 10 seasons and 3 premierships with the club.\n\n=== Michael Voss: 2009\u20132013 ===\n{{Main|2009 Brisbane Lions season|2010 Brisbane Lions season}}\n[[File:FevolaBrisbane.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Brendan Fevola]] became the first player to be traded the year after winning the [[Coleman Medal]]. He originally came from [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]].]]\nThe Lions made a good start in the [[2009 NAB Cup]] under new senior coach Michael Voss by registering a 9-point win over [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]. However this was followed by a series of losses in the pre-season to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]. Their season ended with a 51-point loss to the [[Western Bulldogs]].\n\nThe 2009/2010 off-season was dominated by the arrival of [[Brendan Fevola]] from Carlton, and the hype was focused on Fevola and Jonathan Brown in the sense that the Lions could capitalise on their strong 2009 season. Indeed, the Lions won their first four matches of the 2010 season to be top of the ladder after four rounds, but they would only win three more games after that to crash to a lowly finish by season's end. One of those wins however, was against eventual premiers {{AFL Col}}.\n\nThe Lions' 2010/2011 off-season was disrupted by the sacking of Fevola after just one season at the Lions, following repeated off-field indiscretions which included getting drunk in the Brisbane streets during New Year's Eve celebrations. On the field, the Lions won only four games for the year, but only one against any Victorian team, and that was {{AFL Nor}}, in Round 9. Despite their worst season since 1998, coach [[Michael Voss]] was granted a contract extension after the board recommended that Voss was the best man to take the club forward into the future. Leading into season 2012, only two players from the triple-premiership winning team of 2001\u20132003 remained: [[Simon Black]] and [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]].\n\nThe 2013 season started well for Brisbane, defeating [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the final of the [[NAB Cup]], with [[Daniel Rich]] winning the Michael Tuck Medal for best on ground and [[Aaron Cornelius]] showing some good form. However, things began to decline from then, with losses to the [[Western Bulldogs]] and [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]]. However, in the 5th [[QClash]] match against [[Gold Coast Suns|Gold Coast]], the Lions won by two points, with [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] winning the Marcus Ashcroft Medal. Injuries were beginning to take a toll, with young players [[Claye Beams]] and [[Jared Polec]] suffering severe injuries. In Round 13, Brisbane defeated second-placed [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], coming from 52 points down late in the third quarter to win by 5 points due to an [[Ash McGrath]] [[After the siren kicks in Australian rules football|goal after the siren]] in his 200th match.\n\nOn 13 August 2013, coach Michael Voss was told that his contract would not be renewed.<ref>http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/brisbane-lions-coach-michael-voss-will-not-be-given-a-new-contract/story-fni5f4q3-1226696515172</ref><ref>http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/afl/afl-news/lions-sack-coach-michael-voss-20130813-2ru9b.html</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/lions-sack-coach-michael-voss-20130813-2ru9b.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Voss not boss}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/lions-sack-coach-michael-voss-20130813-2ru9b.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Michael Voss sacked by Brisbane Lions}}</ref>\n\n=== Playing under Justin Leppitsch: 2014\u20132016 ===\nOn 25 August 2013, former premiership player of the Lions, [[Justin Leppitsch]], was confirmed to be the senior coach of the Lions for the next 3 seasons starting in 2014\n\nOn 18 October 2013, Brisbane Lions legend Simon Black announced his retirement.\n\nDuring round 13, 2014 Lions captain Jonathan Brown was the victim of a facial injury in a clash between the Lions and the Greater Western Sydney Giants. He collided with Tomas Bugg's knee and was taken off the ground. He suffered a concussion, which caused his retirement from football. Along with the retirement of [[Ashley McGrath]] in August 2014, no active players remain from any of the club's triple-premiership winning sides.<ref>[http://www.triplem.com.au/melbourne/sport/afl/news/2014/8/brisbane-lions-ash-mcgrath-retiring-from-afl/ Brisbane Lions' Ash McGrath Retiring From AFL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070408/http://www.triplem.com.au/melbourne/sport/afl/news/2014/8/brisbane-lions-ash-mcgrath-retiring-from-afl/ |date=4 March 2016 }}, ''Triple M Melbourne'', 21 August 2014</ref>\n\nOn 29 August 2016, Leppitsch was sacked as coach of the Lions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brisbane Lions sack coach Justin Leppitsch after 'bitterly disappointing' AFL season|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-29/brisbane-lions-coach-justin-leppitsch-sacked/7794768|website=ABC|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Chris Fagan era: 2017\u2013present ===\nOn 4 October 2016, Chris Fagan was announced as the Lions' coach from the 2017 season onwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/brisbane/brisbane-lions-unveil-chris-fagan-as-new-coach/news-story/daf4cef4c36e641631e6751226106bcb|title=Brisbane Lions unveil Chris Fagan as new coach|publisher=''[[Herald Sun]]''|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=11 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Corporate==\n\n===Membership base and sponsorship===\nCrowds and memberships for the Brisbane Lions grew dramatically during the four seasons in which they made the AFL Grand Final.

time) of Maroon and Blue. The club used this from 1997 to the end of 2001 after their first premiership. In 2002 the club would unveil a new emblem in the shape of a football with the words \"Brisbane Lions\" in the middle with the golden Lion placed inside the O of Lion. The club continued the use of this emblem until the 2010 season when they changed the entire emblem dropping the golden Lion and replaced it with a cartoonish style Lions head. The club also removed the golden Lion from the team guernseys and introduced the new emblem on the body of the original Lion. The change was met with much backlash as many supporters dubbed the new emblem the \"Paddle Pop Lion\" after the popular ice cream of the same name. In 2014 after overwhelming response from the supporters the club dropped the new emblem from their guernseys and reintroduced the classic golden Lion which they wore from 1997 until 2010. Though the club has kept the current emblem for all club related advertising and marketing.\n\n===Guernseys===\n\nThe three types of guernsey are:\n\n*Home guernsey (worn since [[2015 AFL season|2015]]): Maroon and blue based guernsey with original [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] lion, coloured gold and maroon. [[Vero Insurance]] is the sponsor on the front and [[Camperdown Dairy International]] is the sponsor on the back (home shorts worn in home games and away shorts worn in away games not played in Victoria). The Lions also wore this jumper from 1997-2009 before switching to a more 'modern' lion.\n*Away guernsey (Worn since [[2015 AFL season|2015]]): Red and blue based guernsey with original Fitzroy lion, coloured gold and red. Camperdown Dairy International is the sponsor on the front and Vero Insurance is the sponsor on the back (away shorts worn).  The Lions also wore this jumper from 2008-2009 before switching to a more 'modern' lion.\n*Clash guernsey (Worn since [[2017 AFL season|2017]]): Reminiscent of the [[Brisbane Bears|Bears]]\u2019 final guernsey, this guernsey features maroon, yellow and white with original Fitzroy lion, coloured maroon and gold.  Camperdown Dairy International is the sponsor on the front and Vero Insurance is the sponsor on the back (away shorts worn).\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Lions mascot.jpg|thumb|70px|Bernie \"Gabba\" Vegas]]\nAs of 2016 the lions new mascot 'Roy' was introduced.\nThe Lion's [[Mascot Manor]] representative and club mascot is Bernie \"Gabba\" Vegas, a caricature of a lion dressed in Brisbane Lions jumper, sunglasses, wide lapels, and flares, designed to resemble [[Elvis Presley]].\n\n===Song===\nThe club's team song, \"The Pride of Brisbane Town\", is based on the Fitzroy club song, and is sung to the music of \"[[La Marseillaise]]\", the French national anthem:<ref name=\"ABC_AM_29Oct2009_Eastly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2727075.htm|title=Brisbane Lions face court action over new logo|last=[[Tony Eastley]]|date=29 October 2009|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>We are the pride of Brisbane town,\nwe wear maroon, blue and gold,\nwe will always fight for victory,\nlike Fitzroy and Bears of old,\nall for one, and one for all,\nwe will answer to the call,\ngo Lions, Brisbane Lions,\nwe'll kick the winning score,\nyou'll hear our mighty roar!</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\nThe Brisbane Lions have three main rivals, [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast]].\n\n===Collingwood===\nThe biggest rival for the Lions is [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], both of these clubs have been involved in scrappy and brutal encounters. In early 2000\u2019s they played in many monumental games including Grand Finals. Having built up plenty of history in the relatively short existence as a merged club. Pre-merger [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] was a neighbouring suburb to Collingwood, with the boundary being based on Smith Street,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/About-Yarra/Maps/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123336/http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/About-Yarra/Maps/ |archive-date=3 December 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> along with the fact that Fitzroy and Collingwood topped the VFL/AFL premiership tally during the early decades of the VFL competition. The [[Brisbane Bears]] also had a bit of history with the Magpies as [[Nathan Buckley]] famously deflected to Collingwood after one season on the Bears list, citing that he wanted to win premierships, ironically retiring at the end of the 2007 season without a premiership as a player in the AFL.<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/buckley-still-haunted-by-flag-failures-20120116-1q38x.html</ref> The Bears also lost their final regular season match in their final season to the Magpies, costing the Bears the minor premiership that season.<ref name=\"forever.collingwoodfc.com.au\">https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/matches/1996-collingwood-vs-brisbane-round-22/</ref> However the rivalry between the Lions and the Magpies has been properly ignited post-merger, starting in late 1999 when Collingwood played their last ever VFL/AFL game at their spiritual home ground, [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]] with the Lions emerging 42 point victors that day and consigning the Magpies to their second wooden spoon, to the dissatisfaction of the Collingwood supporters.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1086</ref> The rivalry between the two clubs went to the next level as the clubs played off in two consecutive Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003, with the Lions emerging victors on both occasions.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1654</ref><ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1839</ref> These grand final results further fueled the bitterness that Collingwood supporters and their president [[Eddie McGuire]] still have towards the Brisbane Lions to this day, despite the Lions having a poor decade on the field after their golden era. Due to many Collingwood supporters migrating up to Queensland and many Brisbane Lions supporters residing in Victoria (many of which were ex-Fitzroy supporters), along with the on-field history between the two clubs, many Lions supporters consider a Brisbane Lions v Collingwood match-up to be their derby, despite the clubs being over 1700&nbsp;km apart and the fact that there are many clubs in the competition that are geographically closer to each other.\n\n===Port Adelaide===\nThe second biggest rival of the Lions is [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], with the Brisbane Bears and Fitzroy merging to become the Brisbane Lions in order to allow Port Adelaide to enter the AFL competition. This created some dissatisfaction between old Bears and Fitzroy supporters who have felt that they have lost their clubs. In their first season in the AFL, the Lions narrowly made the finals at the expense of Port Adelaide, with the Power narrowly missing out on percentage.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_ladder?year=1997&pt=SE&st=SE&</ref> However the rivalry was properly ignited during the early 2000s, as both clubs fielded strong teams during that period. In 2001 the Lions defeated the Power in the Qualifying final en route to their first of three consecutive premierships,<ref>http://finalsiren.com/MatchDetails.asp?GameID=1761&Code=d792a5fb1374aeb888c9354990eda506</ref> with Port bowing out in straight sets that year. In 2002 Port defeated Brisbane by 6 points in the final regular season game to narrowly claim the minor premiership,<ref>http://finalsiren.com/MatchDetails.asp?GameID=171&Code=b211f2aceea18ad41bfb3de17404a733&Sort=PlayerName%20Asc</ref> however Brisbane would eliminate Port in the Preliminary Final that year to claim their second premiership out of their hat-trick of premierships.<ref>http://finalsiren.com/MatchDetails.asp?Code=95b1fd3a00988baeead214a288e7fd65&GameID=1757</ref> In 2003 Port would claim their second consecutive minor premiership, however they would go on to lose their qualifying and preliminary finals again, as the Lions would claim their hat-trick of premierships that season. However, in 2004 Port Adelaide would finally break through and win their first AFL premiership, defeating the Brisbane Lions in the Grand Final and preventing them from what would have been a historic four premierships in a row.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=2024</ref> In adding further insult to injury for Lions fans, it meant that their biggest rivals, Collingwood, would remain the only team in the VFL/AFL to win four-in-a-row. The rivalry between the two clubs has cooled down since the early 2000s, however, there are a few Lions supporters that still consider Port Adelaide to be a bigger rival than Collingwood.\n\n===Gold Coast===\nThe introduction of the Gold Coast Suns into the competition in [[2011 AFL Season|2011]] saw a rivalry within Queensland Football for the first time ever. The Lions and Suns play each other two times a year. The best player on the ground is awarded the '''Marcus Ashcroft Medal'''. Gold Coast won the first QClash by 8 points in Round 7, 2011.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Men's===\n\n====Seniors====\n* '''[[Australian Football League]]'''\n:* '''Premierships (3)''': [[2001 AFL Grand Final|2001]], [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002]], [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003]]\n:* '''Runners-up (1)''': [[2004 AFL Grand Final|2004]]\n:* '''[[List of Australian Football League wooden spoons|Wooden spoons]] (2)''': [[1998 AFL season|1998]], [[2017 AFL season|2017]]\n:* '''[[List of Australian Football League pre-season and night series premiers|Pre-season grand final appearances]]'''\n::* '''Premierships (1)''': [[2013 NAB Cup|2013]]\n::* '''Runners-up (2)''': [[2001 Ansett Australia Cup|2001]], [[2007 NAB Cup|2007]]\n\n====Reserves====\n* '''[[Queensland Australian Football League]]'''\n:* '''Premierships (1)''': [[Queensland Australian Football League|2001]]\n* '''[[North East Australian Football League]]'''\n:* '''Premierships (3)''': [[North East Australian Football League|2012]], [[North East Australian Football League|2013]], [[North East Australian Football League|2017]]\n\n===Women's===\n* '''[[AFL Women's]]'''\n: '''Runners-up (2)''': [[2017 AFL Women's season|2017]], [[2018 AFL Women's season|2018]]\n: '''Minor premierships (1)''': [[2017 AFL Women's season|2017]]\n===Individual===\n{{Main article|List of Brisbane Lions individual awards and records}}\n\n==Club facts==\n\n'''Premierships'''\n* [[2001 AFL season|2001]]\n* [[2002 AFL season|2002]]\n* [[2003 AFL season|2003]]\n\n'''Runners-up'''\n* [[2004 AFL season|2004]]\n\n'''Wooden spoons'''\n* [[1998 AFL season|1998]]\n* [[2017 AFL season|2017]]\n\n'''Coaches'''\n* [[John Northey]]: 1997\u20131998\n* [[Roger Merrett]]: 1998 (caretaker)\n* [[Leigh Matthews]]: 1999\u20132008\n* [[John Blakey]]: 2005 (caretaker)\n* [[Michael Voss]]: 2009\u20132013\n* [[Mark Harvey]]: 2013 (caretaker)\n* [[Justin Leppitsch]]: 2014\u20132016\n* [[Chris Fagan (Australian footballer)|Chris Fagan]]: 2017\u2013present\n\n'''Captains'''\n* [[Michael Voss]] (co-captain: 1997\u20132000; captain: 2000\u20132006)\n* [[Alastair Lynch]] (co-captain: 1997\u20132000)\n* [[Chris Johnson (footballer, born 1976)|Chris Johnson]] (co-captain: 2007)\n* [[Nigel Lappin]] (co-captain: 2007\u20132008)\n* [[Simon Black]] (co-captain: 2007\u20132008)\n* [[Luke Power]] (co-captain: 2007\u20132008)\n* [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] (co-captain: 2007\u20132008, 2013; captain: 2009\u20132012)\n* [[Jed Adcock]] (co-captain: 2013; captain: 2014)\n* [[Tom Rockliff]] (captain: 2015\u20132016)\n* [[Dayne Beams]] (captain: 2017\u20132018)\n* [[Dayne Zorko]] (captain: 2018\u2013present)\n\n'''Biggest home crowds'''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based [[solder]]. \n\nAlthough there were many IRA men\u2014both Official and Provisional\u2014at the protest, it is claimed they were all unarmed, apparently because it was anticipated that the paratroopers would attempt to \"draw them out\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Rumours of plan to clear Bogside are 'nonsense' |author=David Sharrock |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020627205642/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F03%2F30%2Fnuls130.html |archivedate=27 June 2002 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=16 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> March organiser and MP [[Ivan Cooper]] had been promised beforehand that no armed IRA men would be near the march.

Cleared of misconduct; Saville cited in the report that Loden \"neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> The inquiry found that Loden could not be held responsible for claims (whether malicious or not) by some of the individual soldiers that they had received fire from snipers.\n*Captain [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]]: Second in command of 1 Para on the day of Bloody Sunday. Cleared of sinister actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major Loden on why they had fired. This list became known as the \"Loden List of Engagements\" which played a role in the Army's initial explanations. While the inquiry found the compiling of the list was 'far from ideal', Jackson's explanations were accepted based on the list not containing the names of soldiers and the number of times they fired.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]]: Commander of land forces and set the British strategy to oversee the civil march in Derry. Cleared of any fault, but his selection of 1 Para, and in particular his selection of Colonel Wilford to be in control of arresting rioters, was found to be disconcerting, specifically as \"1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Brigadier Pat MacLellan: Operational commander of the day. Cleared of any wrongdoing as he was under the impression that Wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base, and could not be blamed for Wilford's actions.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" />\n*Major Michael Steele: With MacLellan in the operations room and in charge of passing on the orders of the day.

He is also called the second \"Apostle of the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]\".\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBruno was from a noble family of [[Querfurt]] (now in  [[Saxony-Anhalt]]). He is rumored to have been a relative of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. At the age of six, he was sent to be educated at the cathedral school in [[Magdeburg]], seat of [[Adalbert of Magdeburg]], the teacher and namesake of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]]. While still a youth, he was made a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Cathedral of Magdeburg]]. The fifteen-year-old Otto III made Bruno a part of his royal court. While in [[Rome]] for Otto's imperial coronation, Bruno met [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert of Prague]], the first \"Apostle of the Prussians\", killed a year later, which inspired Bruno to write a biography of St. Adalbert when he reached the [[Christianization#Hungary|recently Christianized]] and consolidated [[Kingdom of Hungary]] himself. Bruno spent much time at the monastery where Adalbert had become a [[monk]] and where abbot [[John Canaparius]] may have written a life of Saint Adalbert. Later, Bruno entered a monastery near [[Ravenna]] that Otto had founded, and underwent strict [[ascetic]] training under the guidance of [[Saint Romuald]].<ref name=Meier>{{catholic|title=St. Bruno of Querfurt|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03018a.htm|last=Meier|first=Gabriel|volume=3|date=1908|access-date=6 September 2017|inline=1}}</ref>\n\n=== Missionary life ===\n[[Image:Pomeraniae Ducatus Tabula.jpg|thumb|450px|The lands given St. Bruno in 1003 were in the region shown on left bank of the Oder, [[Hither Pomerania]] along the coast, or the future [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] to its south.]]\n\n[[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] hoped to establish a monastery between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]] (somewhere in the  [[Paganism|pagan]] lands that became [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] or Western <!-- don't join as [[Western Pomerania]]... the generic name is the only one with a map applicable to the era-->[[Pomerania]]) to help convert the local population to Christianity and colonize the area. In 1001, two monks from his monastery traveled to Poland, while Bruno was with Otto in Italy, studying the language and awaiting the Apostolic appointment by [[Pope Sylvester II]].<ref name=Meier/> \n\nIn 1003 [[Pope Sylvester II]] appointed Bruno, at the age of 33, to head a mission amongst the pagan peoples of Eastern Europe. Bruno left Rome in 1004, and having been named an archbishop was consecrated in February of that year by Archbishop Tagino of Magdeburg.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wLkmSBuUxeoC&pg=PA193&dq=Bruno+of+Querfurt&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwja0cPF2PvaAhUxtlkKHfvXC6o4ChDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&q=Bruno%20of%20Querfurt&f=false Duckett, Eleanor Shipley.

There he went to the places that Saint Adalbert of Prague had attended.\n\nBruno tried to persuade [[Ahtum]], the Duke of [[Banat]], who was under jurisdiction of [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to accept the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of Rome]], but this precipitated a large controversy leading to organized opposition from local monks. Bruno elected to gracefully exit the region after he first finished his book, the famous ''\"Life of [[Saint Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]],\"'' a literary memorial giving a history of the (relatively recent) conversion of the Hungarians.<ref name=Meier/>\n\nAfter this diplomatic failure, Bruno went to [[Kiev]], where Grand Duke [[Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev|Vladimir I]] authorized him to make [[Christian]] converts among the [[Pechenegs]], semi-nomadic [[Turkic peoples]] living between the [[Danube]] and the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] rivers.<ref name=Meier/> Bruno spent five months there and baptized some thirty adults. He helped to bring about a peace treaty between them and the ruler of Kiev.\n\nBefore leaving for Poland, Bruno [[Consecration|consecrated]] a bishop for the [[Pechenegs]].

Yotvingia was a Prussian region, then subordinate to [[Kievan Rus]] (since 983), that intersected the borders of what was then [[Old Prussia|Prussia]], Kievan Rus and the [[Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>According to the \"Annals of Magdeburg\" (c. 1170) and some other sources.</ref>\n\nBruno met opposition in his efforts to evangelize the borderland and that when he persisted in disregarding their warnings he was [[decapitation|beheaded]] in 9 March 1009, and most of his eighteen companions were hanged by Zebeden, brother of Netimer.<ref name=Butler/> Duke [[Boleslaus the Brave]] bought the bodies and brought them to Poland (it was supposed that they were laid to rest in [[Przemy\u015bl]], where some historians place Bruno's diocese; such localization of the Bruno's burial place is hardly probable because Przemy\u015bl then belonged to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Kievan Rus through 1018). The ''Annals of Magdeburg,'' [[Thietmar of Merseburg]]'s ''Chronicle'', the ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'', various works of [[Magdeburg]] Bishops, and many other written sources of 11th\u201315th centuries record this story.\n\nSoon after his death, Bruno and his companions were venerated as martyrs and Bruno was soon after [[canonized]].

Night after night in New York he sat in the Apollo transfixed by the pounding rhythms, the dancing and prancing, the sexual spectacle of rhythm-and-blues masters like Bo Diddley.&nbsp;... In 1955, Elvis's stage presence was still rudimentary. But watching Bo Diddley charge up the Apollo crowd undoubtedly had a profound effect on him. When he returned to New York a few months later for his first national television appearance, on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey's \"Stage Show,\" he again spent hours at the Apollo after rehearsals.

In the 1960s he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the [[Alan Freed]] concerts, for example),<ref name=\"SoundsShow\"/> but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. The album title ''Surfing with Bo Diddley'' derived from his influence on [[surf music|surf]] guitarists rather than surfing per se.\n\nIn 1963, Diddley starred in a UK concert tour with the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Little Richard]] along with the Rolling Stones ( an unknown band at that time).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=Fe62DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=Bo+diddley+1963&source=bl&ots=LwJF_Bkdz9&sig=4cno_uACJe4cBRRNo-RZN2xHfmQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH6eyFrLHWAhWK34MKHXRKC4A4FBDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&q=Bo%20diddley%201963&f=false|title=Symphony and Song: The Intersection of Words and Music|last=Kennedy|first=Victor|last2=Gadpaille|first2=Michelle|date=2016-12-14|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443857338|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote many songs for himself and also for others.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bo-diddley/biography|title=Bo Diddley Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref> In 1956 he and guitarist Jody Williams co-wrote the [[pop music|pop song]] \"[[Love Is Strange]]\", a hit for [[Mickey & Sylvia]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/career50s.html |title=Bo Diddley \u2013 The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> He also wrote \"Mama (Can I Go Out)\", which was a minor hit for the pioneering rockabilly singer [[Jo Ann Campbell]], who performed the song in the 1959 rock and roll film ''[[Go Johnny Go]]''.\n\nAfter moving from [[Chicago]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], the basement of his home at 2614 Rhode Island Avenue NE, housed his first [[home recording]] studio.

Diddley also produced and recorded [[Marvin Gaye]] (his valet), a member of the local Doo Wop group, the Marquees. Diddley co-wrote the Marquees' first single featuring Gaye titled \"Wyatt Earp\". It was released on [[Okeh Records]], after the Chess brothers turned it down. During this time, [[Moonglows]]' founder [[Harvey Fuqua]] sang backing vocals on many of Diddley's home recordings.

The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as [[Dick's Picks Volume 30|Volume 30]] of the band's concert album series, ''[[Dick's Picks]]''. Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack of the ground-breaking animated film ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' contained his song \"Bo Diddley\", in which a crow idly [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-pops]] to the track.\n\nDiddley spent some years in [[New Mexico]], living in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] from 1971 to 1978, while continuing his musical career.

(Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\". In 1983, he played a pawnbroker in the movie [[Trading Places]].\n\nDiddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]] and his band, consisting of Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums and Gus Thornton on bass. In 2006, he participated as the headliner of a [[grassroots]]-organized fundraiser concert to benefit the town of [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], which had been devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]].

Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: '''One''' e and '''ah''', two e '''and''' ah, three e '''and''' ah, '''four''' e and ah (the boldface counts are the [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm).\n\nMany songs (for example, \"[[Hey Bo Diddley]]\" and \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\") often have no [[chord (music)|chord]] changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic [[tension (music)|tension and release]]. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used various rhythms, from straight [[beat (music)|back beat]] to [[Popular music|pop]] [[ballad]] style to [[doo-wop]], frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.\n\nAn influential guitar player, Bo Diddley developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack, particularly the resonant \"shimmering\" sound. His trademark instrument was his self-designed, one-of-a-kind, rectangular-bodied \"Twang Machine\" (referred to as \"cigar-box shaped\" by music promoter [[Dick Clark]]) built by [[Gretsch]]. He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the \"Cadillac\" and the rectangular \"Turbo 5-speed\" (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others). In a 2005 interview on [[Triple J|JJJ]] radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a [[Gibson L5]] guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2015-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2015-03-13}}</ref> He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar.

The song \"Bo Diddley\" was based on the African-American clapping rhyme \"[[Juba dance|Hambone]]\" (which in turn was based on the [[lullaby]] \"[[Hush Little Baby]]\"). Likewise, \"Hey Bo Diddley\" is based on the song \"[[Old MacDonald]]\". The song \"Who Do You Love?\" with its [[roots of hip hop|rap]]-style boasting, and his use of the African-American game known as \"[[the dozens]]\" on the songs \"Say Man\" and \"Say Man, Back Again,\" are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music (for example, \"You got the nerve to call somebody ugly.

He had to leave the country after [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919]]. He acted in several films in [[Weimar Germany]] before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship.\n\nIn 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula|novel]]. He later appeared in the classic 1931 film ''Dracula'' by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in popular horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his repertoire, and he tried unsuccessfully to avoid typecasting.\n\nMeanwhile, he was often paired with [[Boris Karloff]], who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi, a charter member of the American [[Screen Actors Guild]], was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally so that they could put his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939); even in ''The Raven'', Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for [[sciatica|sciatic neuritis]], and he became addicted to [[morphine]] and [[methadone]]. This drug dependence was noted by producers, and the offers eventually dwindled to a few parts in [[Ed Wood]]'s low-budget films\u2014most notably ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. Lugosi, who was married five times and had one son, [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela George]], died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bela Lugosi 18.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lugosi at age 18]]\nLugosi, the youngest of four children,<ref name=monsters-universal-studios>{{cite book|author1=Osborn, Jennifer (editor)|author2=Milano, Roy (photo captions)|year=2006|title=Monsters: A Celebration of the Classics from Universal Studios|publisher=Del Ray Books, imprint of Random House, Inc.|location=New York, NY|page=38|isbn=0-345-48685-4}} Referenced information is from an essay in the book written by his son Bela G.

Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mank|first1=Gregory William|title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff : the expanded story of a haunting collaboration, with a complete filmography of their films together|date=2009|publisher=McFarland & Co., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0786434805|pages=237\u2013238}}</ref> Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had \"never learned his trade\". Universal did cast Lugosi in a couple of heroic parts, as in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', and a romantic role in the adventure serial ''[[The Return of Chandu]]'', but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Of course, Karloff had a leg up on Lugosi simply by being a native English speaker; Lugosi had to learn English as a second language, and was never able to shed his heavy accent.\n[[File:B\u00e9la Lugosi-Angelo Rossitto in Scared to Death.jpg|thumb|With [[Angelo Rossitto]] in ''[[Scared to Death]]'' (1947)]]\nLugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 ''Players Directory'', published by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films \"an error.\"<ref>Michael Mallory.

Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror [[B-movie|B-film]] unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for \"name value\" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like [[Nat Levine]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Sam Katzman]]. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the [[Actors Fund of America]] to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nHistorian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book ''Showmen, Sell It Hot!'', that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. \"I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre,\" said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. \"I was dead, and he brought me back to life.\" Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe first was Universal's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), when he played the character role of [[Igor (fictional character)|Ygor]], a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi making a rare appearance in an A-list motion picture: he was a stern commissar in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]] and directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. He was effective in this small but prestigious character role, and it could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's [[Poverty Row]], playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] B-films were released by [[Monogram Pictures]]. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. ''[[The Gorilla (1939 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1939) had him playing [[double act|straight man]] to [[Patsy Kelly]].\n[[File:Invisible Ghost (1941) 1.jpg|thumb||left|Lugosi (center) with [[Polly Ann Young]] and [[Clarence Muse]] in ''[[The Invisible Ghost]]'' (1941)]]\n\nOstensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic [[sciatica]]. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as [[asparagus]] juice, doctors increased the medication to [[opiate]]s. The growth of his dependence on [[analgesic]] drugs, particularly [[morphine]] and, after 1947 when it became available in America, [[methadone]], was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Universal's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue. Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], from line readings at the end of ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bela-Lugosi|title=Bela Lugosi {{!}} Hungarian-American actor|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}</ref> Lugosi played Dracula for a second and last time on film in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n''Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'' was Bela Lugosi's last \"A\" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared \u2014 less and less frequently \u2014 in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947-50, he performed in [[summer stock]], often in productions of ''Dracula'' or ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', and during the other parts of the year made personal appearances in a touring \"spook show\", and on early commercial television.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn September 1949 [[Milton Berle]] invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/9-27-1949/episode/670241/summary.htmlTexaco Star Theater Episode Guide], tv.com; accessed 1 November 2015.</ref> Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Tom|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|page=160|isbn=0-7864-2070-7}}</ref> His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series ''[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]'' on October 11, 1949, in an adaptation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]''.<ref>''The Complete Actors' Television Credits, 1948\u20131988, James Robert Parrish and Vincent Terrace''<!--publishing info, ISSN/ISBN, year needed--></ref>\n\nIn 1951, while in [[England]] to play a six-month tour of ''Dracula'', Lugosi co-starred in a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] film comedy, ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (also known as ''Vampire over London'' and ''My Son, the Vampire''). Following his return to the United States, he was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: \"Now I am the [[Bogeyman|boogie man]].\" In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the Mother Riley [[farce]]. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, ''[[Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla]]'' co-starring nightclub comedians [[Duke Mitchell]] and [[Sammy Petrillo]], whose act closely resembled that of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Stage and personal appearances===\nWhile Lugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage with plenty of personal appearances, as film offers declined, he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family. Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P. Dowd in ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'' to help himself professionally. He also made plenty of personal appearances to promote his horror image and/or an accompanying film.<ref name=\"Bela Lugosi In Person\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaffenberger|first1=Bill|last2=Rhodes|first2=Gary|title=No Traveler Returns: The Lost Years of Bela Lugosi|date=2012|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=1593932855|url=https://www.amazon.com/No-Traveler-Returns-Years-Lugosi/dp/1593932855/}}</ref>\n\n===Ed Wood and final projects===\n[[File:PlanNine 08.jpg|thumb|Lugosi in Ed Wood's ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)]]\nLate in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in films when ambitious filmmaker [[Ed Wood]], a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as an anonymous narrator in ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' and a [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]-like [[mad scientist]] in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. During [[post-production]] of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his [[drug addiction]], and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to [[Kitty Kelley]]'s biography of [[Frank Sinatra]], when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited Lugosi at the hospital. Sinatra would recall Lugosi's amazement at his visit, since the two men had never met before.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Kitty|title=His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1987|page=248|isbn=0-553-26515-6}}</ref>\n\nDuring an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, ''The Ghoul Goes West''. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including ''The Phantom Ghoul'' and ''Dr. Acula''. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of [[Tor Johnson]]'s home, a suburban graveyard, and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired [[Tom Mason]], his wife's [[chiropractor]], to double for Lugosi in additional shots.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php|title=Bela Lugosi's Legacy|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|work=Lost|accessdate=2008-10-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917071843/http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php|archivedate=17 September 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref> Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''.\n\nFollowing his treatment, Lugosi made one final film, in late 1955, ''[[The Black Sleep]]'', for Bel-Air Pictures, which was released in the summer of 1956 through [[United Artists]] with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances. To Lugosi's disappointment, however, his role in this film was that of a [[Muteness|mute]], with no dialogue.<ref name=\"Bela Lugosi: Dreams and Nightmares\">{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary|last2=Sheffield|first2=Richard|title=Bela Lugosi: Dreams and Nightmares|date=2007|publisher=Collectables Press|isbn=0977379817|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bela-Lugosi-Rhodes-Richard-Sheffield/dp/0977379817}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Lugosi B\u00e9la sz\u00ednm\u0171v\u00e9sz \u00e9s els\u0151 feles\u00e9ge, Szmik Ilona.

They decide to seek refuge in Willows House, which is supposedly [[Abandoned property|abandoned]] and [[Haunted house|haunted]]. When they reach Willows House, they find it to be occupied and the current owner repeatedly denies them hospitality. One of the hunters attempts to force his entry into the house, but a giant [[octopus]] is released from its tank and sent after the intruders.<ref name=\"Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster\">{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary|last2=Weaver|first2=Tom|title=Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster|date=2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=1593938578}}</ref> One of the fleeing hunters is killed by the octopus, while the other is captured by the giant. The owner is a scientist, Dr. Eric Vornoff, and the giant is his mute assistant, Lobo. Vornoff explains that he will perform an experiment on the unwilling hunter, who dies on the operating table.<ref name=\"Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster\"/>\n\nIn a police station, Officer Tom Robbins sees Lieutenant Dick Craig. There are now 12 missing victims, and the police still do not know what happened to them. The reporter behind the newspaper reports is Janet Lawton, Craig's [[Engagement|fianc\u00e9e]]. Janet forces her way into the office and argues with Robbins, and vows to go to Lake Marsh to investigate. At the police station, Robbins and Craig have a meeting with an intellectual from Europe, Professor Vladimir Strowski, who agrees to assist the police in investigating the Marsh, but not at night. As night falls and another storm begins, Janet drives alone to Lake Marsh, but visibility is poor and she drives off the road and into a [[ravine]]. Lobo rescues her.<ref name=\"Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster\"/>\n\nJanet awakens to find herself a prisoner of Vornoff, who uses [[hypnosis]] to put her back to sleep. The following day, Craig and his partner drive to the area around Lake Marsh, a [[swamp]]. The partners also discuss the strange weather and mention that the newspapers could be right about [[History of nuclear weapons|\"the atom bomb explosions distorting the atmosphere\"]]. The duo eventually discover Janet's abandoned car and realize she is the 13th missing victim. They leave the swamp while, Strowski drives a rented car to the swamp.<ref name=\"Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster\"/>\n\nJanet awakens at Willows House. Vornoff assures her that Lobo is harmless, but the giant seems fascinated with the female captive and approaches her with questionable intent. Vornoff explains the giant is human and that Vornoff found him in the \"[[wilderness]] of [[Tibet]]\". Vornoff then hypnotically places Janet back to sleep. He orders Lobo to transport the captive to Vornoff's private quarters. Meanwhile, Strowski silently approaches Willows House and enters through the unlocked front door. While Strowski searches the house, Vornoff arrives to greet him. Their country of origin is interested in Vornoff's groundbreaking experiments with [[atomic energy]] and wants to recruit him. Vornoff narrates that two decades prior, Vornoff had suggested using experiments with [[nuclear power]] which could create [[superhuman]]s of great strength and size. In response, he was branded a [[Mad scientist|madman]] and [[exile]]d by his country. Strowski reveals that he has dreams of conquest in the name of their country, while Vornoff dreams of his creations conquering in his own name. By late evening, Craig and his partner return to the swamp and discover Strowski's abandoned car. The partners split up to search the area, Craig heading towards Willows House. Back in the secret laboratory, Vornoff uses a wave of his hand to summon Janet to his current location. She arrives dressed as a [[bride]], summoned through [[telepathy]]. He has decided to use her as the next subject of his experiments. Lobo is reluctant to take part in this experiment, and Vornoff uses a [[whip]] to re-assert his control over his slave and assistant. Meanwhile, Craig has entered the house and accidentally discovers the secret passage. He is himself captured by Vornoff and Lobo.<ref name=\"Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster\"/>\n\nAs the experiment is about to begin, Lobo is visibly distressed. Taking his decision, Lobo rebels and attacks Vornoff. After a fight, Lobo knocks Vornoff out, releases Janet, and transports the unconscious Vornoff to the operating table. The scientist becomes the subject of his own human experiment. This time the experiment works and Vornoff is transformed to an atomic-powered superhuman being. He and Lobo physically struggle with each other, and their fight destroys the laboratory and starts a fire. Vornoff grabs Janet and escapes from the flames. Robbins and other officers arrive to help Craig. The police pursue Vornoff through the woods. There is another thunderstorm, and a [[lightning strike]] further destroys Willows House. With his home and equipment destroyed, a distressed Vornoff abandons Janet and merely attempts to escape. Craig rolls a rock at him and lands him in the water with the octopus. They struggle until a nuclear explosion obliterate both combatants, apparently the end result of the chain reaction started at the destroyed laboratory. Robbins comments that Vornoff \"[[Playing God (ethics)|tampered in God's domain]]\".<ref name=\"Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dr. Eric Vornoff\n* [[Tor Johnson]] as Lobo\n* Tony McCoy as Lt.

Actual shooting began in October 1954 at the Ted Allan Studios, but further money problems quickly halted the production.<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> The required funds were supplied by a rancher named Donald McCoy, who became the film's producer. He also provided his son to star as the film's hero.<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> According to screenwriter Dennis Rodriguez, casting the younger McCoy as a protagonist was one of two terms Donald imposed on Wood. The other term was to include an atomic explosion in the finale.<ref name=\"Craig2\">Craig (2009), p. 293-294</ref> Production resumed in 1955 at Centaur Studios.<ref name=\"Rhodes2\">Rhodes (2006), p. 142-143</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre|Paramount theater]] in May 1955, under the title ''Bride of the Atom''.<ref name=\"rhodes\">\n{{cite book| last = Rhodes| first = Gary D.| authorlink =| title = ''Lugosi: his life in films, on stage, and in the hearts of horror lovers''| year = 1997| publisher = McFarland| location =| isbn = 0-7864-0257-1}}</ref> The film was reportedly completed and released through a deal with [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]]. Arkoff profited from the film more than Wood, and his earnings contributed to the funding of [[American International Pictures]].<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 83\u2013103</ref> The ending credits identify the copyright holder of the film as \"Filmakers Releasing Organization\".<ref name=\"Craig2\"/><ref name=\"Reid\">Reid (2007), p. 26\u201327</ref> Distribution rights were held by Banner Films in the United States, and by Exclusive in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Reid\">Reid (2007), p. 26\u201327</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n\n===Genre and background===\nThe film combines elements of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction]], genres which were frequently combined in films of the 1950s. Like many of these contemporaries, ''Bride'' serves in part as a [[Cold War]] [[propaganda film]]. Once again, an external threat from \"[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]\" serves as the enemy of the righteous [[History of the United States (1945\u201364)|United States]]. In Cold War [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], foreign nations served as a [[Defamation|vilified]] and [[Demonization|demonized]] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] for American audiences.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The country of origin for Vornoff and Strowski is left unnamed. The only clues is that it is European and has its own dreams of conquest. By implication, the country which exiled Vornoff in the 1930s could be [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Soviet Union]]. Their role as villains for the American cinema had already been solidified by the 1950s, and Wood could be alluding to both of them. Strowski uses the term [[master race]], which is a key concept in [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nBoth the working title ''Bride of the Atom'' and the final title ''Bride of the Monster'' allude to the earlier film ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935).<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The film otherwise follows the template of the [[Poverty Row]] [[horror film]]s of the 1940s. The [[Atomic Age]] influences the film in its ominous implications concerning [[nuclear weapon]]s and the threat they posed towards human civilization.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> Rob Craig makes an argument for including the film in a subgenre of Cold War-themed thrillers along with ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955), ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1959), ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959), ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964) and ''[[Fail Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]'' (1964).<ref name=\"Craig2\"/>\n\n===Content===\nThis was [[Bela Lugosi]]'s last speaking role in a feature film.<ref name=\"Rhodes2\"/> Lugosi subsequently played a silent part in ''[[The Black Sleep]]'' (1956). ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959) uses silent archive footage of Lugosi, but he died prior to the creation of its script. The footage was from an unfinished film called ''The Vampire's Tomb''.<ref name=\"Rhodes3\">Rhodes (2006), p. 143\u2013145</ref> ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (1959 film)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' (1959) recycled footage from Lugosi's earlier films, possibly mixed with some new material.<ref name=\"Rhodes3\"/> According to Rob Craig, in ''Bride'' Lugosi for the last time plays  \"a charismatic [[villain]] whose [[megalomania]] leads to downfall and destruction\". Craig considers this to be one of Lugosi's finest roles, citing the surprisingly energetic performance of the aging actor.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The scenes involving hypnosis contain [[close-up]]s of Lugosi's eyes. Wood was probably trying to recreate similar scenes from an older film of Lugosi, ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932).<ref name=\"Craig\"/> Lugosi did not actually play Vornoff in the scenes demanding physical combat. The film made use of [[body double]]s for Lugosi: [[Eddie Parker (actor)|Eddie Parker]] and Red Reagan.<ref name=\"Craig\"/><ref name=\"Reid\"/> Parker was also the body-double of Lugosi in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943).<ref name=\"Rhodes2\"/> Lugosi's fee for the film is estimated at 1000 [[dollar]]s.<ref name=\"Rhodes2\"/>\n\nThe story could almost be a sequel to an earlier Bela Lugosi movie, \"The Corpse Vanishes\"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} (Each bride at her wedding was given an orchid, which she sniffed before passing out. In \"The Corpse Vanishes\", Bela played a doctor who captured the brides and took some kind of liquid from each bride's body and injected it into his wife to make her temporarily young again. Characters included his wife, an old woman, the old woman's grown son, and a dwarf.) In \"Bride of the Monster\", Bela again plays a doctor doing experiments, but his only housemate/assistant is Lobo, and when his experiment fails to turn someone into an \"atomic-powered superman\", he throws the dead body to an octopus or an alligator, similar to what Bela did in \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe hunters of the opening scenes are unnamed in the actual scenes, but identified later in the film as Jake Long and Blake \"Mac\" McCreigh.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> According to the credits, Jake was played by John Warren and Mac by [[Bud Osborne]].<ref name=\"Reid\"/> The police office scenes feature cameos by a drunk and a newspaper seller. The former is played by Ben Frommer (known for playing Count Bloodcount in ''[[Transylvania 6-5000 (1963 film)|Transylvania 6-5000]]''), the latter is played by [[William Benedict]] (known as one of [[The Bowery Boys]]).<ref name=\"Reid\">Reid (2007), p. 26\u201327</ref> Janet Lawton briefly speaks with a co-worker called Margie. Margie is played by [[Dolores Fuller]]. Dick Craig's partner, Martin, is played by Don Nagel. Both Fuller and Nagel had worked with Wood in ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'' (1954).<ref name=\"Craig\"/><ref name=\"Reid\"/>\n\nThe film uses both stock footage of a real octopus and a fake, rubber octopus in scenes where \"the monster\" interacts with actors. It is widely believed this is a prop from the film ''[[Wake of the Red Witch]]'' (1948). Contradictory accounts claim that Wood either stole or rented the prop from [[Republic Pictures]], which produced the earlier film.<ref name=\"Craig2\"/><ref name=\"Rhodes2\"/><ref name=\"Craig\"/> The struggle between Vornoff and the octopus was filmed at [[Griffith Park]].<ref name=\"Rhodes2\"/>\n\nCraig comments that there is a stark contrast between the characters of Dick Craig and Janet Lawton. Dick speaks in a [[deadpan]] unemotional way and seems to be a rather lethargic character. Janet is a \"brassy girl reporter\", a dynamic character with a sense of autonomy.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The role was reportedly intended for [[Dolores Fuller]]. According to Fuller's recollections, [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]] bribed Wood into casting her as Janet, with promises of securing further funding for the film. Fuller was so reduced to a cameo role.<ref name=\"Craig2\"/> King vehemently denies bribing Wood, so the story lacks confirmation.<ref name=\"Craig2\"/>\n\nIn a subplot of the film, there are storms every night for three months and strange weather patterns. The characters attribute the phenomenon to the effects the [[nuclear explosion]]s have on the atmosphere. This probably reflects actual anxiety of the 1950s about potential [[climate change]]. Until the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] (1963), atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] was used widely and recklessly.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> Rob Craig suggests that the months of constant storms could be inspired by the [[Genesis flood narrative]].<ref name=\"Craig\"/> In the context of the film, the strange weather is implied to be a side-effect of the experiments of Vornoff which apparently release radioactivity to the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nThe dialogue of the film includes memorable lines such as \"''Home? I have no home!\"'' and \"''One is always considered mad, when one discovers something which others cannot grasp\"''. The phrases could well apply to the fates of [[avant-garde]] artists and thinkers.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The title \"''Bride of the Atom\"'', which Vornoff uses for Janet in the bridal dress, is inexplicable unless the scientist is actually attempting to use Janet to replace his long-lost wife. One of his reassuring lines to Janet concerning the experiment, \"''It hurts, just for a moment, but then you will emerge a woman...\"'', sounds as if preparing her for the loss of her [[virginity]].<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The scene of a young woman, in a bridal gown, restrained by leather shackles seems to be [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] in nature.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nThroughout the film, the mute Lobo is implied to have an unspecified [[intellectual disability]] and to be of sub-human intelligence. Yet he successfully operates complex machinery as if trained to do so. Craig views this scene as implying that supposedly \"dumb\" servants, can have a capacity of learning the secrets of their masters .<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nThe final scenes, with the [[mushroom cloud]] of the nuclear explosion, use stock footage from the blast of a [[thermonuclear weapon]] (\"hydrogen bomb\").<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\n===Film series===\nThe apparent fetish of Lobo with [[angora wool]] is a reflection of Wood's own fetish for the material. This also serves as the film's connection to ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (1953), where the fetish plays a more prominent role.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes (2006), p. 137</ref>\n\nThe character of Lobo also appeared again in Wood's ''[[Night of the Ghouls]]''. This film served as a sequel of sorts to ''Bride''. Vornoff is absent from the later film, but there are references to the activities of \"the mad doctor\".\n<ref name=\"Rhodes2\"/><ref name=\"imdb-ghouls\">{{cite web| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156843/| title = ''Night of the Ghouls''| work = [[Internet Movie Database]]| accessdate = 2006-05-18}}</ref> [[Tor Johnson]] also plays a character called Lobo in ''[[The Unearthly]]'' (1957) by Boris Petroff. This character also serves the main villain.<ref name=\"Craig3\">Craig (2013), p. 135\u2013137</ref>\n\nThis film is part of what Wood aficionados refer to as \"The Kelton Trilogy\", a trio of films featuring [[Paul Marco]] as Officer Kelton, a whining, reluctant policeman. The other two films are ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' and ''[[Night of the Ghouls]]''.

These events are also alleged in the 2004 documentary, ''The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made.'' However, other stories circulated insist Wood legitimately rented the octopus, along with some cars.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} To remedy the lack of movement from the octopus prop, whenever someone was killed by the monster in the film, they simply flailed around in the shallow water while holding the tentacles to imitate movement. The filming of these scenes, as well as the production of the film in general, were played to comic effect in ''Ed Wood''.\n\nRudolph Grey's book ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D.

Since there are infinitely many positive integers, this means that there are positive integers that cannot be defined by phrases of under sixty letters. If there are positive integers that satisfy a given property, then there is a ''smallest'' positive integer that satisfies that property; therefore, there is a smallest positive integer satisfying the property \"not definable in under sixty letters\". This is the integer to which the above expression refers. The above expression is only fifty-seven letters long, therefore it ''is'' definable in under sixty letters, and is ''not'' the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters, and is ''not'' defined by this expression. This is a paradox: there must be an integer defined by this expression, but since the expression is self-contradictory (any integer it defines is definable in under sixty letters), there cannot be any integer defined by it.\n\nPerhaps another helpful analogy to Berry's Paradox would be the phrase, \"indescribable feeling\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Menken|first1=Alan|last2=Ashman|first2=Howard|last3=Rice|first3=Tim|title=Aladdin (Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook)|date=1 Dec 1992|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0793517826|url=https://www.amazon.com/Aladdin-Piano-Vocal-Guitar-Songbook/dp/0793517826|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref>  If the feeling is indeed indescribable, then no description of the feeling would be true.  But if the word \"indescribable\" communicates something about the feeling, then it may be considered a description: this is self-contradictory.\n\nMathematician and computer scientist Gregory J. Chaitin in ''The Unknowable'' (1999) adds this comment: \"Well, the Mexican mathematical historian Alejandro Garcidiego has taken the trouble to find that letter [of Berry's from which Russell penned his remarks], and it is rather a different paradox. Berry\u2019s letter actually talks about the first ordinal that can\u2019t be named in a finite number of words. According, to Cantor\u2019s theory such an ordinal must exist, but we\u2019ve just named it in a finite number of words, which is a contradiction.\"\n\n== Resolution ==\n{{Confusing|section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Berry paradox as formulated above arises because of systematic [[ambiguity]] in the word \"definable\". In other formulations of the Berry paradox, such as one that instead reads: \"...not [[name]]able in less...\" the term \"nameable\" is also one that has this systematic ambiguity. Terms of this kind give rise to [[vicious circle principle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.<ref>Russell and Whitehead (1927).</ref> To resolve one of these paradoxes means to pinpoint exactly where our use of language went wrong and to provide restrictions on the use of language which may avoid them.\n\nThis family of paradoxes can be resolved by incorporating stratifications of meaning in language. Terms with systematic ambiguity may be written with subscripts denoting that one level of meaning is considered a higher priority than another in their interpretation. \"The number not nameable<sub>0</sub> in less than eleven words\" may be nameable<sub>1</sub> in less than eleven words under this scheme.<ref>[[Willard Quine|Quine, Willard]] (1976). ''Ways of Paradox''. Harvard University Press.</ref>\n\n== Formal analogues ==\n\nUsing programs or proofs of bounded lengths, it is possible to construct an analogue of the Berry expression in a formal mathematical language, as has been done by [[Gregory Chaitin]].  Though the formal analogue does not lead to a logical contradiction, it does prove  certain impossibility results.\n\n[[George Boolos]] (1989) built on a formalized version of Berry's paradox to prove [[G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem]] in a new and much simpler way. The basic idea of his proof is that a [[proposition]] that holds of ''x'' if and only if ''x'' = ''n'' for some natural number ''n'' can be called a ''definition'' for ''n'', and that the set {(''n'', ''k''): ''n'' has a definition that is ''k'' symbols long} can be shown to be representable (using [[G\u00f6del number]]s). Then the proposition \"''m'' is the first number not definable in less than ''k'' symbols\" can be formalized and shown to be a definition in the sense just stated.\n\n==Relationship with Kolmogorov complexity==\n{{main | Kolmogorov complexity}}\n\nIt is not possible in general to unambiguously define what is the minimal number of symbols required to describe a given string (given a specific description mechanism). In this context, the terms ''string'' and ''number'' may be used interchangeably, since a number is actually a string of symbols, e.g. an English word (like the word \"eleven\" used in the paradox) while, on the other hand, it is possible to refer to any word with a number, e.g. by the number of its position in a given dictionary or by suitable encoding. Some long strings can be described exactly using fewer symbols than those required by their full representation, as is often achieved using [[data compression]]. The complexity of a given string is then defined as the minimal length that a description requires in order to (unambiguously) refer to the full representation of that string.\n\nThe Kolmogorov complexity is defined using [[formal language]]s, or [[Turing machines]] which avoids ambiguities about which string results from a given description. It can be proven that the Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. The proof by contradiction shows that if it were possible to compute the Kolmogorov complexity, then it would also be possible to systematically generate paradoxes similar to this one, i.e. descriptions shorter than what the complexity of the described string implies. That is to say, the definition of the Berry number is paradoxical because it is not actually possible to compute how many words are required to define a number, and we know that such computation is not possible because of the paradox.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Busy beaver]]\n* [[Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]]\n* [[Definable number]]\n* [[Hilbert\u2013Bernays paradox]]\n* [[Interesting number paradox]]\n* [[List of paradoxes]]\n* [[Richard's paradox]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite paper | last = Bennett | first = Charles H. | date = 1979 | title = On Random and Hard-to-Describe Numbers. | citeseerx=10.1.1.27.3492  | url = http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_pubs.php?person=us-bennetc&t=1 | journal = IBM Report RC7483 }}.<!---apparently-outdated:---http://www.research.ibm.com/people/b/bennetc/Onrandom.pdf--->\n* [[George Boolos|Boolos, George]] (1989) \"A new proof of the G\u00f6del Incompleteness Theorem\", ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society 36'': 388\u201390; 676.

The number of events has grown significantly over the years. Beginning in 1984, women biathletes had their own World Championships, and finally, from 1989, both genders have been participating in joint BWCHs. In 1978 the development was enhanced by the change from the large army rifle calibre to a small bore rifle, while the range to the target was reduced from 150 to 50 meters.\n\n== BWCH venues ==\nThe season's BWCHs takes place during February or March. Some years it has been necessary to schedule parts of the Championships at other than the main venue because of weather and/or snow conditions. Full, joint BWCHs have never been held in [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic Winter Games]] seasons. BWCHs in non-IOC events, however, have been held in Olympic seasons. In 2005, the then new event of Mixed Relay (two legs done by women, two legs by men) was arranged separately from the ordinary Championships.\n\nArranged Championships:\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Biathlon World

Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases [[water]], are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by ''[[prana]]'', the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of ''prana'', and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].\n\nBreatharianism is considered a deadly [[pseudoscience]] by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation and dehydration.

Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as \"[[peace lines]]\", erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.<ref name=\"Peacelines\">{{Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

More generally, it refers to the dark mica series, primarily a [[solid solution|solid-solution]] series between the [[iron]]-endmember [[annite]],  and the [[magnesium]]-endmember [[phlogopite]]; more [[Aluminium|aluminous]] end-members include [[siderophyllite]]. Biotite was named by [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann|J.F.L. Hausmann]] in 1847 in honor of the French [[physicist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who performed early research into the many [[Optical mineralogy|optical properties]] of [[mica]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann| title = Handbuch der Mineralogie| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqgTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA674| year = 1828| publisher = Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht| isbn = | page = 674 }} \"Zur Bezeichnung des sogenannten einachsigen Glimmers ist hier der Name Biotit gew\u00e4hlt worden, um daran zu erinnern, da\u00df Biot es war, der zuerst auf die optische Verschiedenheit der Glimmerarten aufmerksam machte.\"  (For the designation of so-called uniaxial mica, the name \"biotite\" has been chosen in order to recall that it was Biot who first called attention to the optical differences between types of mica.)</ref>\n\nBiotite is a [[Silicate_minerals#Phyllosilicates|sheet silicate]]. [[Iron]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]] form sheets that are weakly bound together by [[potassium]] [[ion]]s. It is sometimes called \"iron mica\" because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite. It is also sometimes called \"black mica\" as opposed to \"white mica\" ([[muscovite]]) \u2013 both form in the same [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and in some instances side-by-side.\n\n==Properties==\nLike other [[mica]] minerals, biotite has a highly perfect [[basal cleavage]], and consists of flexible sheets, or [[Lamellae (materials)|lamellae]], which easily flake off.  It has a [[monoclinic crystal system]], with [[tabular]] to [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] crystals with an obvious [[wikt:pinacoid|pinacoid]] termination.  It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|pseudohexagonal]] crystal.  Although not easily seen because of the cleavage and sheets, fracture is uneven. It appears greenish to brown or black, and even yellow when [[weathering|weathered]]. It can be transparent to opaque, has a vitreous to pearly [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], and a grey-white [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]]. When biotite is found in large chunks, they are called \"books\" because it resembles a book with pages of many sheets. The color of biotite is usually black and the mineral has a hardness of 2.5\u20133 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]].\n\nBiotite [[Solvation|dissolves]] in both [[acid]] and [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] [[aqueous solution]]s, with the highest [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] rates at low [[pH]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malmstr\u00f6m|first1=Maria|last2=Banwart|first2=Steven|title=Biotite dissolution at 25\u00b0C: The pH dependence of dissolution rate and stoichiometry|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=July 1997|volume=61|issue=14|pages=2779\u20132799|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00093-8}}</ref> However, biotite dissolution is highly [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] with crystal edge surfaces ([[Miller index|''h k''0]]) reacting 45 to 132 times faster than basal surfaces ([[Miller index|001]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Mark E.|title=Does reactive surface area depend on grain size?

For instance, biotite occurs in the [[lava]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and in the Monzoni intrusive complex of the western [[Dolomites]]. Biotite in [[granite]] tends to be poorer in magnesium than the biotite found in its volcanic equivalent, [[rhyolite]].<ref name=\"CTV74\">{{cite book |title=Igneous Petrology | publisher=McGraw-Hill |last1=Carmichael |first1=I.S. |last2=Turner |first2=F.J. |last3=Verhoogen |first3=J. |year=1974 |location=New York |pages=250 |isbn=0-07-009987-1}}</ref> Biotite is an essential [[phenocryst]] in some varieties of [[lamprophyre]].

Because [[argon]] escapes readily from the biotite crystal structure at high temperatures, these methods may provide only minimum ages for many rocks. Biotite is also useful in assessing temperature histories of metamorphic rocks, because the partitioning of [[iron]] and [[magnesium]] between biotite and [[garnet]] is sensitive to temperature.\n\n==References== \n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Biotite}}\n{{Phyllosilicates}}\n\n[[Category:Magnesium minerals]]\n[[Category:Iron minerals]]\n[[Category:Potassium minerals]]\n[[Category:Aluminium minerals]]\n[[Category:Phyllosilicates]]\n[[Category:Monoclinic minerals]]\n[[Category:Mica group]]", "sha1": "o2u0s897h616d273t3uqhn8vjoatv5y"}}, {"title": "Brigham Young", "ns": "0", "id": "5048", "revision": {"id": "865575233", "parentid": "864658659", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T19:25:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "Premeditated Chaos", "id": "31530"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Removing link(s): [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Richards\u2013Young family]] closed as delete ([[WP:XFDC|XFDcloser]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{ Infobox Latter Day Saint biography\n | name                = Brigham Young\n | image               = Brigham Young by Charles William Carter.jpg\n | caption             = Brigham Young [[Circa|c.]] 1870\n | birth_date          = {{birth date|mf = yes|1801|06|01}}\n | birth_place         = [[Whitingham, Vermont]], U.S.\n | death_date          = {{death date and age|mf = yes|1877|08|29|1801|06|01}}\n | death_place         = [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah Territory]], U.S.\n | death_cause         = Ruptured appendix\n | resting_place       = [[Brigham Young Cemetery]]\n | resting_place_coordinates = {{Coord|40.7703|-111.8856|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Brigham Young Cemetery}}\n | boards              =\n | spouse              = See [[List of Brigham Young's wives]]<!-- Since number of spouses is disputed, leave this blank -->\n | children            = 56<ref name=byubio>{{citation |url= http://yfacts.byu.edu/Article?id=214 |title= Brigham Young Biography: Facts of Faith |work= Y Facts |publisher= BYU |access-date= September 19, 2013 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130920194808/http://yfacts.byu.edu/Article?id=214 |archive-date= September 20, 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n | parents             = John and Abigail Young\n | awards              =\n | signature           = Brigham Young Signature.svg\n | signature_alt       = Signature of Brigham Young\n | website             = [http://www.brighamyoung.org/ brighamyoung.org]\n | portals             = LDS\n | footnotes           =\n | position_or_quorum1 = 2nd [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n | predecessor1        = [[Joseph Smith]]\n | successor1          = [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]]\n | start_date1         = {{start date|mf = yes|1847|12|27}}\n | end_date1           = {{end date|mf = yes|1877|08|29}}\n | position_or_quorum2 = [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]\n | start_date2         = {{start date|1840|04|14}}\n | end_date2           = {{end date|mf = yes|1847|12|27}}\n | predecessor2        = [[Thomas B.

Young acknowledged the suffering the doctrine created for women, but stated its necessity for creating large families, proclaiming: \"But the first wife will say, 'It is hard, for I have lived with my husband twenty years, or thirty, and have raised a family of children for him, and it is a great trial to me for him to have more women;' then I say it is time that you gave him up to other women who will bear children.\"<ref>http://jod.mrm.org/4/51. Vol.4 p.56</ref>\n\nOne of the more controversial teachings of Young was the [[Adam\u2013God doctrine]]. According to Young, he was taught by Smith that [[Adam]] is \"our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do\". According to the doctrine, Adam was once a mortal man who became resurrected and [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exalted]]. From another planet, Adam brought [[Eve]], one of his wives, with him to the earth, where they became mortal by eating the fruit of the [[Garden of Eden]]. After bearing mortal children and establishing the human race, Adam and Eve returned to their heavenly thrones where Adam acts as the god of this world. Later, as Young is generally understood to have taught, Adam returned to the earth to become the biological father of Jesus.<ref>Widmer, Kurt (2000), ''Mormonism and the Nature of God: A Theological Evolution, 1830\u20131915'', Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, p. 131.</ref><ref>Gary James Bergera, [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,2878 \"The Orson Pratt\u2013Brigham Young Controversies: Conflict Within the Quorums, 1853 to 1868\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614014538/http://content.lib.utah.edu/u/?%2Fdialogue%2C2878 |date=June 14, 2011 }}, [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] '''13'''(2):7\u201349 (1980) at p. 41.</ref><ref>Boyd Kirkland, [https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/044-36-44.pdf \"Jehovah as the Father: The Development of the Mormon Jehovah Doctrine\"], ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'' '''44''':36\u201344 (1984) at p. 39 (Adam \"later begot Jesus, his firstborn spirit son, in the flesh\").</ref> The LDS Church has since repudiated the Adam\u2013God doctrine.<ref>Spencer W.

During the defense of Utah, now called the [[Utah War]], Young held the [[U.S. Army]] at bay for a winter by taking their cattle and burning supply wagons. The Mormon forces were largely successful thanks to [[Lot Smith]]. Young eventually relented and agreed to step down as governor. He later received a [[pardon]] from Buchanan.

As governor, Young had promised the federal government he would protect immigrants passing through Utah Territory, but over 120 men, women and children were killed in this incident. There is no debate concerning the involvement of individual Mormons from the surrounding communities by scholars. Only children under the age of seven, who were cared for by local Mormon families, survived, and the murdered members of the wagon train were left unburied. The remains of about forty people were later found and buried, and [[Union Army]] officer [[James Henry Carleton]] had a large cross made from local trees, the transverse beam bearing the engraving, \"Vengeance Is Mine, Saith The Lord: I Will Repay\" and erected a [[cairn]] of rocks at the site. A large slab of granite was put up on which he had the following words engraved: \"Here 120 men, women and children were massacred in cold blood early in September, 1857. They were from Arkansas.\" For two years the monument stood as a memorial to those travelling the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Spanish Trail]] through Mountain Meadow.

The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, occasionally  known as '''Robert Burns Day''' (or '''Robbie Burns Day'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/g00/m/wp/tag/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/life/travel/forks-amp-the-road-hurling-haggis-for-robbie-burns-day&pubdate=2016-12-06&t=robbie-burns&i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F |title=Forks & The Road: Hurling haggis for Robbie Burns Day |publisher=''National Post'' |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref> or '''Rabbie Burns Day''') but more commonly known as '''Burns Night''' ({{lang-sco|Burns Nicht}}). However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year.\n\n==History==\nThe first supper was held ''in memoriam'' at [[Burns Cottage]] by Burns's friends, on 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death; it has been a regular occurrence ever since. The first still extant Burns Club was founded in [[Greenock]] in 1801 by merchants who were born in [[Ayrshire]], some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday, 29 January 1802, but in 1803, they discovered the [[Ayr]] parish records that noted his date of birth was actually 25 January 1759.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm |title=Congratulation Greenock Burns Club |date= |work= |publisher=The Robert Burns World Federation Limited |accessdate=18 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126011456/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since then, suppers have been held on or about 25 January.\n\nBurns suppers may be formal or informal. Both typically include [[haggis]] (a traditional Scottish dish celebrated by Burns in ''[[Wikisource:Address to a Haggis|Address to a Haggis]]''), [[Scotch whisky]] and the recitation of Burns's poetry. Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the [[Freemason]]s or [[St. Andrew|St Andrews]] Societies; they occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. Formal suppers follow a standard order.\n\n== Standard order ==\n===Piping in guests===\nA piper generally greets the guests, who gather and mix as at any informal party.<ref name=bbc/> At less formal gatherings, traditional [[Scottish music]] is played.<ref name=vs>[http://www.visitscotland.com/en-us/about/robert-burns/supper-whats-involved \"Burns Supper \u2013 what's involved?\", ''VisitScotland.com'', Buidheann Turasachd N\u00e0iseanta na h-Alba]</ref>\n\n=== Host's welcoming speech ===\nThe [[Master of ceremonies|host]] says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns/burns_night_running_order.shtml|title=BBC - Robert Burns - Burns Night - Running Order|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAll the guests are seated and [[Grace (prayer)|grace]] is said, usually using the ''Selkirk Grace'', a well-known thanksgiving said before meals that uses the [[Modern Scots|Scots]] language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century as the \"[[Galloway]] Grace\" or the \"[[Covenanters]]' Grace\". It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the [[Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk|Earl of Selkirk]].\n[[Image:RCMP_Pipe_Band_piping_in_the_Haggus.JPG|thumb|right|Piping in the [[haggis]]]]\n\n==== Selkirk Grace ====\n{{anchor|The Selkirk Grace}}\n:Some hae meat an canna eat,\n:And some wad eat that want it;\n:But we hae meat, and we can eat,\n:And sae the Lord be thankit.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n===Soup course===\nThe supper starts with the soup course.  Normally, a Scottish soup, such as [[Scotch broth]], potato soup, [[cullen skink]], or [[cock-a-leekie soup|cock-a-leekie]], is served.\n\n===Haggis===\n==== \"Piping\" of haggis ====\nEveryone stands as the [[haggis]] is brought in. It is usually brought in by the cook on a large dish, generally while a piper plays the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|bagpipe]] and leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. \"[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]\", \"Robbie Burns Medley\" or \"The Star O' Robbie Burns\" might be played.<ref>Archie Cairns \u2013 Book 1 Pipe Music 1995</ref> The host, or perhaps a guest, then recites the ''\n[[Wikisource:Address to a Haggis|Address to a Haggis]]''.\n[[File:Great chieftain o' the puddin-race.JPG|thumb|A haggis]]\n[[Image:Bob Purdie addressing haggis 20040124.jpg|thumb|right|Addressing the [[haggis]]]]\n\n==== ''Address to a Haggis'' ====\n{|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n|-\n|\nFair fa' your honest, sonsie face,<br />\nGreat chieftain o' the puddin-race!<br />\nAboon them a' ye tak your place,<br />\nPainch, tripe, or thairm:<br />\nWeel are ye wordy o' a grace<br />\nAs lang's my airm.<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n(fa = befall, sonsie = jolly/cheerful)<br />\n<br />\n(aboon = above)<br />\n(painch = paunch/stomach, thairm = intestine)<br />\n(wordy = worthy)\n|-\n|\nThe groaning trencher there ye fill,<br />\nYour hurdies like a distant hill,<br />\nYour pin wad help to mend a mill<br />\nIn time o' need,<br />\nWhile thro' your pores the dews distil<br />\nLike amber bead.<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n<br />\n(hurdies = buttocks)\n|-\n|\nHis knife see rustic Labour dicht,<br />\nAn' cut you up wi' ready slicht,<br />\nTrenching your gushing entrails bricht,<br />\nLike ony ditch;<br />\nAnd then, O what a glorious sicht,<br />\nWarm-reekin, rich!<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n(dicht = wipe, here with the idea of sharpening)<br />\n(slicht = skill)\n\n<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n(reekin = steaming)\n|-\n|\nThen, horn for horn, they stretch an' strive:<br />\nDeil tak the hindmaist! on they drive,<br />\nTill a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve,<br />\nAre bent like drums;<br />\nThen auld Guidman, maist like to rive,<br />\n\"Bethankit\" hums.<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n<br />\n(deil = devil)<br />\n(swall'd = swollen, kytes = bellies, belyve = soon)<br />\n(bent like = tight as)<br />\n(auld Guidman = the man of the house, rive = tear, i.e. burst)\n|-\n|\nIs there that o're his French ragout<br />\nOr olio that wad staw a sow,<br />\nOr fricassee wad mak her spew<br />\nWi' perfect scunner,<br />\nLooks down wi' sneering, scornfu' view<br />\nOn sic a dinner?<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n<br />\n(olio = stew, from Spanish ''olla''/stew pot, staw = make sick)<br />\n<br />\n(scunner = disgust)\n|-\n|\nPoor devil! see him ower his trash,<br />\nAs feckless as a wither'd rash,<br />\nHis spindle shank, a guid whip-lash,<br />\nHis nieve a nit;<br />\nThro' bloody flood or field to dash,<br />\nO how unfit!<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n(nieve = fist, nit = nut, i.e. tiny)\n|-\n|\nBut mark the Rustic, haggis fed,<br />\nThe trembling earth resounds his tread.<br />\nClap in his wallie nieve a blade,<br />\nHe'll mak it whistle;<br />\nAn' legs an' arms, an' heads will sned,<br />\nLike taps o' thristle.<br />\n<br />\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n<br />&nbsp;<br />\n(wallie = mighty, nieve = fist)<br />\n<br />\n(sned = cut off)<br />\n(thristle = thistle)\n|-\n|\nYe Pow'rs wha mak mankind your care,<br />\nAnd dish them out their bill o' fare,<br />\nAuld Scotland wants nae skinkin ware<br />\nThat jaups in luggies;<br />\nBut, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer,<br />\nGie her a haggis!\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n<br />&nbsp;<br />\n(skinkin ware = watery soup)<br />\n(jaups = slops about, luggies = two-handled continental bowls)\n|}\nAt the line ''His knife see rustic Labour dicht'', the speaker normally draws and sharpens a knife. At the line ''An' cut you up wi' ready slicht'', he plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end.  When done properly, the \"ceremony\" is a highlight of the evening.\n\n=== Main course ===\n[[File:Haggis.JPG|thumb|Haggis platter at a Burns supper in the US]]\n[[File:A haggis serving.JPG|thumb|Haggis served ''wi tatties an neeps'' (with potatoes and swede)]]\nAt the end of the poem, a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, and the company will sit down to the meal. The haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed [[rutabaga|swede]] (neeps).<ref name=vs/>\n\n===Other courses===\nA dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc., may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance, dessert may be [[cranachan]] or tipsy laird (whisky trifle), followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the \"water of life\" (uisge beatha), [[Scotch whisky]].\n\n===Toasts===\nWhen the meal reaches the coffee stage, various speeches and toasts are given.\n\n==== Immortal memory ====\nThe main speaker gives a speech remembering some aspect of Burns's life or poetry. It may be either light-hearted or serious and may include the recitation of a poem or a song by Burns. A toast to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns then follows.<ref name=vs/>\n\n====Address to the Lassies ====\nThis was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to the women who had prepared the meal. However, it is now much more wide-ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing and not offensive, particularly since it will be followed by a reply from the \"lassies\" concerned. The men drink a toast to the women's health.\n\n==== Reply to the Laddies ====\nThis is occasionally (and humorously) called the \"Toast to the Laddies\". Like the previous toast, it is generally now quite wide-ranging. A female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech, it should be amusing but not offensive. Quite often, the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.\n\n=== Works by Burns ===\nAfter the speeches there may be singing of songs by Burns (such as ''[[Ae Fond Kiss]]'', ''[[Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation|Parcel o' Rogues]]'' and ''[[A Man's a Man for A' That|A Man's a Man]]'') and more poetry (such as ''[[To a Mouse]]'', ''[[To a Louse]]'', ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'', ''The Twa Dogs'' and ''Holy Willie's Prayer'').\n\nThat may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts, and it goes on for as long as the guests wish. It may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. Foreign guests may also be invited to sing or say works from their land.\n\n=== Closing ===\nFinally, the host will call on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks. Then, everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing '' [[Auld Lang Syne]]'' to bring the evening to an end.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Burns' Day storm]]\n* [[List of dining events]]\n* [[Scottish cuisine]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Burns supper}}\n{{Wiktionary|Burns night}}\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080130140542/http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/experience/Burns.html A 2007 Supper for Mauchline Burns Club, presented with explanations of each stage]\n*[https://soundcloud.com/kevin-brown-50/address-to-a-haggis-robert A recital of Address to a Haggis]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afOAbMV1rNU   Address to the Unco Guid or the rigidly righteous ]\n*[http://ssa.nls.uk/film.cfm?fid=5034 A film recording of the 145th Burns Supper] from 1971 at the [[Irvine Burns Club]].\n\n{{Robert Burns|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian traditions]]\n[[Category:Dining events]]\n[[Category:Events in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Haggis]]\n[[Category:January observances]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Robert Burns]]\n[[Category:Scottish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Scottish culture]]\n[[Category:Scottish traditions]]\n[[Category:Winter events in Scotland]]", "sha1": "j78pze7iavfy3ptr0b49ogzbe2uefm7"}}, {"title": "Bill Bryson", "ns": "0", "id": "5050", "revision": {"id": "865264739", "parentid": "864090103", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T20:17:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hogyn Lleol", "id": "897251"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Move to the United Kingdom */  improve poor wording", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other people}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name         = Bill Bryson\n| honorific_suffix = {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|HonFRS|size=100%}}\n| image        = Bill Bryson edit.jpg\n| imagesize    = \n| caption      = Bryson in 2005\n| pseudonym    = \n| birth_name   = William McGuire Bryson\n| birth_date   = {{birth date and age|1951|12|08|df=y}}\n| birth_place  = [[Des Moines, Iowa]], U.S.\n| death_date   = \n| death_place  = \n| residence    = [[Hampshire]], England\n| alma_mater   = [[Drake University]]\n| occupation   = Author\n| genres       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Travel]]\n* [[English language]]\n* [[Science]]}}\n| movement     = \n| awards = <!-- prize -->\n| spouse       = {{marriage|Cynthia Billen|1975}}\n| children     = 4\n| website      = {{URL|http://billbryson.co.uk}}\n| signature    = \n}}\n\n'''William McGuire Bryson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|HonFRS}} ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|r|a\u026a|s|\u0259n}}; born 8 December 1951) is an Anglo-American author of books on travel, the English language, science, and other non-fiction topics.

Headon was quickly sacked for his heroin addiction and Lennard either left or was fired and the band folded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beatpatrol.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/big-audio-dynamite-this-is-big-audio-dynamite-1985 |title=Big Audio Dynamite \u2013 \"This Is Big Audio Dynamite\" (1985) |publisher=Beatpatrol.wordpress.com |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726105447/http://beatpatrol.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/big-audio-dynamite-this-is-big-audio-dynamite-1985| archivedate= 26 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Although the band released no material (only demos were recorded which have yet to be officially released), T.R.A.C. can be seen as a forerunner to Big Audio Dynamite in much the same way [[London SS]] can be seen as an early incarnation of the Clash.\n\n===Big Audio Dynamite (1984\u20131990)===\nJones  then formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director [[Don Letts]] (maker of ''[[The Punk Rock Movie]]'', various Clash music videos, and later the Clash documentary ''[[Westway to the World]]''), bassist Leo Williams (from T.R.A.C.), drummer [[Greg Roberts (musician)|Greg Roberts]], and keyboardist [[Dan Donovan (keyboardist)|Dan Donovan]].  In 1985 the group's debut, ''[[This Is Big Audio Dynamite]],'' was released.  The album's cover shows the group as a four-piece (minus Donovan). In 2016 ''This is Big Audio Dynamite'' was reissued for the first time, with the album mastered using analog tapes and pressing it on 180-gram vinyl.\n1986's ''[[No. 10, Upping St.]]'' reunited Jones for one album with former Clash bandmate [[Joe Strummer]], who was a co-producer of the album and co-writer of 5 of its 9 songs.  The cover painting, based on a still taken from the [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]],'' was painted by Tim Jones. BAD supported [[U2]] on their 1987 world tour, then released 1988's ''Tighten Up, Vol. '88'' and 1989's ''[[Megatop Phoenix]]''. ''[[Tighten Up, Vol. 88]]'' contained \"Just Play Music!\", which was the second No.&nbsp;1 single on Billboard's [[Modern Rock Tracks]]. The band also recorded an unreleased track called \"Keep off the Grass\" which was a rock-style instrumental of the theme to the classic western film, ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. A promo video can be seen on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srNAFh86YNk |title=Big Audio Dynamite - Keep Off The Grass (rare video) |publisher=YouTube |date=24 December 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the original line-up wrote and recorded the song \"Free\" for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Flashback (1990 film)|Flashback]]''. This would be the final song written with the original lineup, as the band would dissolve shortly after.  \"Bottom Line\" from the first LP was remixed and used as the title track for ''Flashback''. However this track was not included on the soundtrack. It can be found on the 12\" or by download. Later in 1990, Mick Jones debuted Big Audio Dynamite II and release the UK only album ''Kool-Aid''. Dan Donovan remained in BAD II for one song, a re-working of the final BAD track \"Free\" renamed \"Kickin' In\".\n\n===Big Audio Dynamite II (1991\u20131993)===\nFor 1990's ''[[The Globe (album)|The Globe]]'', only Jones remained from BAD, and the band was now called \"Big Audio Dynamite II\".  This new line-up featured two guitarists. ''The Globe'' featured the band's most commercially successful single, \"[[Rush (BAD song)|Rush]],\" which hit No.&nbsp;1 on both the US modern rock chart and the Australian National [[ARIA Charts|Aria]] Chart. \"Innocent Child\" and \"[[The Globe (song)|The Globe]]\" were also released as singles.\n\nBAD supported U2 on their [[Zoo TV Tour|ZOOTV Tour]], headlined the [[MTV]] [[120 minutes]] tour which also featured [[Public Image Ltd|P.i.L.]], [[Live (band)|Live]], and [[Blind Melon]]<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-28/entertainment/ca-4201_1_blind-melon</ref>, and released the live EP \"On The Road Live '92\".\n\nIn 1993, Greg Roberts formed the electronic dub group [[Dreadzone]] with Tim Bran, with the name suggested to them by Don Letts.  Leo Williams and Dan Donovan joined the band before their second album ''[[Second Light]]'' and the single \"Little Britain\" in 1995.  Dreadzone is still active, with Roberts and Williams remaining members.\n\n===Big Audio (1994)===\n\n[[File:Big Audio Dynamite.jpg|thumb|Big Audio Dynamite in 1995]]\nThe band later recruited keyboardist Andre Shapps (co-producer of ''The Globe'' and Mick Jones's cousin) and Michael \"DJ Zonka\" Custance as DJ and vocalist. Both appeared on the band's 1994 album ''[[Higher Power (album)|Higher Power]]'', which was released under the shortened name \"Big Audio\".\n\n===Final years and subsequent activities (1995\u20132010)===\nAfter signing with [[Gary Kurfirst]]'s [[Radioactive Records]] in 1995, the band reverted to the original \"Big Audio Dynamite\" moniker and released their least successful album to date, ''[[F-Punk]]''.\n\nRadioactive Records refused to release the next proposed BAD album, ''[[Entering a New Ride]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/993081261|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music.|last=Colin.|first=Larkin,|date=2011|publisher=Music Sales|year=|isbn=0857125958|edition=5th |location=London|pages=2600|oclc=993081261}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The line-up contained Mc vocals by [[Joe Attard]] ([[Punks Jump Up]]), [[Ranking Roger]] ([[The Beat (British band)|The Beat]], [[General Public]]) and drummer Bob Wond (Under Two Flags) In 1998, the band launched a new web site, primarily as a means to distribute songs from the ''Entering a New Ride'' album.\n\nSince 2005, Jones has been working on a project with [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]] (ex-member of [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]) called [[Carbon/Silicon]].\n\nIn early 2007, a BAD II live DVD was released.\n\n===2011 reunion===\nIn April 2010, [[Don Letts]] revealed to [[Billboard.com]] that he and [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]] broached the idea of a Big Audio Dynamite reunion in 2011. He explained, \"I could lie to you and say 'Not in a million years,' but... if Mick wasn't tied up with [[Gorillaz]] it might happen this year. (Jones) has looked at me and said, 'Maybe next year,' but who knows. I've got to admit that in the past I'm not a great one for reformations; I always think if you're lucky in life, you get a window of opportunity, use it to the best of your ability and then fuck off and let someone else have their turn. But here I am 25 years down the line considering the thing.\" Besides a Big Audio Dynamite reunion, Letts said he was also hopeful for more Legacy Editions of the group's albums after finding more unreleased material\u2014including live recordings\u2014in the vaults. \"There's definitely more stuff; whether Sony thinks it's worthwhile, that's another matter. But there seems to be a lot of respect for Big Audio Dynamite. Time has shown that a lot of the things we were dabbling in back then have come to manifest themselves today...so hopefully we'll get to do some more.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958688/big-audio-dynamite-reignited |title=Big Audio Dynamite Reignited |publisher=Billboard.com |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe reformation of the original line-up of B.A.D was confirmed on 25 January 2011 with the announcement of a UK tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/big-audio-dynamite/54684 |title=Big Audio Dynamite reform with original line-up |publisher=NME |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> The 9-date tour was a commercial and critical success.

In 1971, Rolls-Royce itself was forced into receivership and the UK government nationalised the company\u2014splitting into two companies the aerospace division (Rolls-Royce Plc) and automotive (Rolls-Royce Motors Limited) divisions\u2014the latter retaining the Bentley subdivision. Rolls-Royce Motors was subsequently sold to engineering conglomerate, Vickers and in 1998, Vickers sold Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen AG.\n\nIntellectual property rights to both the name ''Rolls-Royce'' as well as the company's logo had been retained not by Rolls-Royce Motors, but by aerospace company, Rolls-Royce Plc, which had continued to license both to the automotive division.  Thus the sale of \"Rolls-Royce\" to VW included the Bentley name and logos, vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks (subsequently sold to BMW by VW)\u2014but not the rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo.  The aerospace company, Rolls-Royce Plc, ultimately sold both to [[BMW|BMW AG]].\n\n==Cricklewood (1919\u20131931)==\nBefore [[World War&nbsp;I]],  [[W. O. Bentley|Walter Owen Bentley]] and his brother, Horace Millner Bentley, sold French [[Doriot, Flandrin & Parant|DFP]] cars in Cricklewood, North London, but W.O, as Walter was known, always wanted to design and build his own cars. At the DFP factory, in 1913, he noticed an aluminium paperweight and thought that aluminium might be a suitable replacement for cast iron to fabricate lighter pistons. The first Bentley aluminium pistons were fitted to [[Sopwith Camel]] aero engines during World War&nbsp;I.\n\nIn August 1919, W.O. registered Bentley Motors Ltd. and in October he exhibited a car chassis, with dummy engine, at the [[British International Motor Show|London Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Beaulieu\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Georgano |editor1-first=Nick | authorlink=G.N.

In 1925, he acquired his first Bentley, a 3-litre. With this car he won numerous Brooklands races. Just a year later he acquired the Bentley business itself.\n\nThe Bentley enterprise was always underfunded, but inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by [[John Duff]] and [[Frank Clement (racing driver)|Frank Clement]], Barnato agreed to finance Bentley's business. Barnato had incorporated Baromans Ltd in 1922, which existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested in excess of \u00a3100,000, saving the business and its workforce. A financial reorganisation of the original Bentley company was carried out and all existing creditors paid off for \u00a375,000. Existing shares were devalued from \u00a31 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares giving him control of the company and he became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: \u00a335,000 secured by [[debenture]] in July 1927; \u00a340,000 in 1928; \u00a325,000 in 1929. With renewed financial input, W. O. Bentley was able to design another generation of cars.\n\n===The Bentley Boys===\n{{Main|Bentley Boys|Blue Train Races}}\n[[File:1929 Bentley front 34 right.jpg|thumb|1929 Blower Bentley]]\nThe [[Bentley Boys]] were a group of British motoring enthusiasts that included Barnato, [[Henry Birkin|Sir Henry \"Tim\" Birkin]], [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeple chaser]] George Duller, [[aviator]] [[Glen Kidston]], automotive journalist [[S.C.H. \"Sammy\" Davis]], and [[Dudley Benjafield]]. The [[Bentley Boys]] favoured Bentley cars. Many were independently wealthy and many had a military background.  They kept the marque's reputation for high performance alive; Bentley was noted for its four consecutive victories at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], from 1927 to 1930.\n\nIn 1929, Birkin developed the 4\u00bd-litre, lightweight [[Blower Bentley]] at Welwyn Garden City and produced five racing specials, starting with [[Bentley Blower No.1]] which was optimised for the Brooklands racing circuit. Birkin overruled Bentley and put the model on the market before it was fully developed. As a result, it was unreliable.\n\nIn March 1930, during the [[Blue Train Races]], Barnato raised the stakes on [[Rover Company|Rover]] and its [[Rover Light Six]], having raced and beaten ''[[Le Train Bleu]]'' for the first time, to better that record with his 6\u00bd-litre [[Bentley Speed Six]] on a bet of \u00a3100. He drove against the train from [[Cannes]] to [[Calais]], then by ferry to [[Dover]], and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won.\n\nBarnato drove his [[H.J. Mulliner & Co.|H.J. Mulliner]]\u2013bodied [[sedan (automobile)|formal saloon]] in the race against the Blue Train. Two months later, on 21 May 1930, he took delivery of a Speed Six with streamlined fastback \"sportsman coup\u00e9\" by [[J Gurney Nutting & Co Limited|Gurney Nutting]]. Both cars became known as the \"[[Blue Train Bentley]]s\"; the latter is regularly mistaken for, or erroneously referred to as being, the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1698/Bentley-Speed-Six--Blue-Train-Special-.html |title=Bentley Speed Six 'Blue Train Special' |last=Melissen |first=Wouter |date=12 January 2004 |publisher=UltimateCarPage |accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html |title=The Slippery Shape of Power |last=Burgess-Wise |first=David |date=1 January 2006 |work=Auto Aficionado |accessdate=4 November 2008|deadurl= yes|archivedate= 24 March 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090324025849/http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html}}</ref>  A painting by [[Terence Cuneo]] depicts the Gurney Nutting coup\u00e9 racing along a road parallel to the Blue Train, which scenario never occurred as the road and railway did not follow the same route.\n\n===Cricklewood Bentleys===\n[[File:Bentley Berline 8 liter pic2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bentley 8 Litre]] 4-door sports saloon]]\n* 1921\u20131929 [[Bentley 3 Litre|3-litre]]\n* 1926\u20131930 [[Bentley 4\u00bd Litre|4\u00bd-litre & \"Blower Bentley\"]]\n* 1926\u20131930 [[Bentley Speed Six|6\u00bd-litre]]\n* 1928\u20131930 [[Bentley Speed Six|6\u00bd-litre Speed Six]]\n* 1930\u20131931 [[Bentley 8 Litre|8-litre]]\n* 1931 [[Bentley 4 Litre|4-litre]]\n\nThe original model was the three-litre, but as customers put heavier bodies on the chassis, a larger 4\u00bd-litre model followed. Perhaps the most iconic model of the period is the 4\u00bd-litre \"Blower Bentley\", with its distinctive [[supercharger]] projecting forward from the bottom of the grille. Uncharacteristically fragile for a Bentley it was not the racing workhorse the 6\u00bd-litre was, though in 1930 Birkin remarkably finished second in the [[1930 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix at Pau]] in a stripped-down racing version of the Blower Bentley, behind [[Philippe Etancelin]] in a [[Bugatti Type 35]].\n\nThe 4\u00bd-litre model later became famous in popular media as the vehicle of choice of [[James Bond]] in the original [[Ian Fleming|novels]], but this has been seen only briefly in the [[James Bond film series|films]]. [[John Steed]] in the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' also drove a Bentley.\n\nThe new eight-litre was such a success that when Barnato's money seemed to run out in 1931 and Napier was planning to buy Bentley's business, Rolls-Royce purchased Bentley Motors to prevent it from competing with their most expensive model, the Phantom&nbsp;II.\n\n===Performance at Le Mans===\n[[File:Bentley 6,5-Litre Speed Six Tourer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bentley Speed Six]]]]\n\n====[[24 hours of Le Mans]] Grand Prix d'Endurance====\n* ''[[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans|1923]] 4th (private entry)'' (3-Litre)\n* [[1924 24 Hours of Le Mans|1924]] 1st (3-Litre)\n* ''[[1925 24 Hours of Le Mans|1925]] did not finish''\n* ''[[1926 24 Hours of Le Mans|1926]] did not finish''\n* [[1927 24 Hours of Le Mans|1927]] 1st 15th 17th (3-Litre)\n* [[1928 24 Hours of Le Mans|1928]] 1st 5th (4\u00bd-litre)\n* [[1929 24 Hours of Le Mans|1929]] 1st (Speed Six); 2nd 3rd 4th: (4\u00bd-litre)\n* [[1930 24 Hours of Le Mans|1930]] 1st 2nd (Speed Six)\n\nBentley withdrew from motor racing just after winning at Le Mans in 1930, claiming that they had learned enough about speed and reliability.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bentley Motors To Give Up Racing |work=Evening Telegraph |location= Angus, Scotland|date=1 July 1930 |accessdate=23 July 2014 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000563/19300701/068/0005| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidation===\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the resulting [[Great Depression]] throttled the demand for Bentley's expensive motor cars.

Rolls-Royce had acquired the Bentley showrooms in Cork Street, the service station at Kingsbury, the complex at Cricklewood and the services of Bentley himself. This last was disputed by Napier in court without success. Bentley had neglected to register their trademark so Rolls-Royce immediately did so. They also sold the [[Cricklewood]] factory in 1932.

BMW established a new legal entity, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited, and built a new administrative headquarters and production facility for Rolls-Royce branded vehicles in [[Goodwood plant|Goodwood]], West Sussex, England.\n\n===Investment and company development===\n[[File:SC06 Three Modern Bentleys.jpg|thumb|The Bentley line-up from late 2000s (from left): [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Flying Spur]], [[Bentley Continental GT|Continental GT]], and [[Bentley Arnage|Arnage]]]]\n[[File:2002 Bentley State Limousine.jpg|right|thumb|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Bentley State Limousine]]]]\n[[File:Bentley Bentayga 2015 - front.jpg|thumb|2015 Bentley Bentayga]]\n[[File:Bentley Arnage T (1998).jpg|thumb|right|1998]]\n[[File:Bentley Continental Flying Spur.jpg|thumb|right|2005]]\n[[File:Bentley Continental GT (II) - Frontansicht (1), 30.

In 2003, Bentley's two-door convertible, the [[Bentley Azure]], ceased production, and Bentley introduced a second line, [[Bentley Continental GT]], a large luxury coup\u00e9 powered by a [[W12 engine]] built in Crewe.\n\nDemand had been so great that the factory at Crewe was unable to meet orders despite an installed capacity of approximately 9,500 vehicles per year; there was a waiting list of over a year for new cars to be delivered. Consequently, part of the production of the new [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Flying Spur]], a four-door version of the Continental GT, was assigned to the [[Transparent Factory]] (Germany), where the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury car is also assembled. This arrangement ceased at the end of 2006 after around 1,000 cars, with all car production reverting to the Crewe plant.\n\nIn April 2005, Bentley confirmed plans to produce a four-seat convertible model\u2014the [[Bentley Azure|Azure]], derived from the [[Bentley Arnage|Arnage Drophead Coup\u00e9]] prototype\u2014at Crewe beginning in 2006. By the autumn of 2005, the convertible version of the successful Continental GT, the [[Bentley Continental|Continental GTC]], was also presented. These two models were successfully launched in late 2006.\n\nA limited run of a [[Zagato]] modified GT was also announced in March 2008, dubbed \"[[Bentley Continental GT#Bentley GTZ (2008)|GTZ]]\".\n\nA new version of the Bentley Continental was introduced at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2009|2009 Geneva Motor Show]]: The [[Bentley Continental Supersports|Continental Supersports]]. This new Bentley is a supercar combining extreme power with environmentally friendly FlexFuel technology, capable of using petrol (gasoline) and biofuel (E85 ethanol).\n\nBentley sales continued to increase, and in 2005 8,627 were sold worldwide, 3,654 in the United States. In 2007, the 10,000 cars-per-year threshold was broken for the first time with sales of 10,014.
