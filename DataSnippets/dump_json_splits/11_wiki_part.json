Although the term \"Heathenry\" is often employed to cover the entire religious movement, different Heathen groups within the United States often prefer the term \"\u00c1satr\u00fa\" or \"Odinism\" as self-designations.\n\nHeathenry appeared in the United States during the 1960s, at the same time as the wider emergence of [[Neopaganism in the United States|modern Paganism in the United States]]. Among the earliest American group was the [[Odinist Fellowship (United States)|Odinist Fellowship]], founded by Danish migrant [[Else Christensen]] in 1969.\n\n==History==\n\u00c1satr\u00fa grew steadily in the United States during the 1960s.{{sfn|Paxson|2002|p=17}} In 1969, the Danish Odinist [[Else Christensen]] established the [[Odinist Fellowship (United States)|Odinist Fellowship]] from her home in [[Florida]], U.S.A.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=165|2a1=Asprem|2y=2008|2p=46}} Heavily influenced by [[Alexander Rud Mills]]' writings,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=167&ndash;168}} she began publication of a magazine, ''The Odinist'',{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=171|2a1=Asprem|2y=2008|2p=46}} although this focused to a greater extent on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1996|1p=226|2a1=Adler|2y=2006|2p=289}} [[Stephen McNallen]] first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s, before creating the [[\u00c1satr\u00fa Free Assembly]] (AFA) in 1976, which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of [[neo-Nazis]] within the group. In the 1990s, McNallen founded the [[\u00c1satr\u00fa Folk Assembly]] (AFA), an ethnically oriented Heathen group headquartered in California.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1996|1pp=200&ndash;205|2a1=Paxson|2y=2002|2pp=16&ndash;17|3a1=Strmiska|3a2=Sigurvinsson|3y=2005|3p=128|4a1=Adler|4y=2006|4p=286}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Valgard Murray]] and his kindred in [[Arizona]] founded the [[\u00c1satr\u00fa Alliance]] (AA) in the late 1980s, which shared the AFA's perspectives on race and which published the ''Vor Tru'' newsletter.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1996|1pp=206&ndash;213|2a1=Paxson|2y=2002|2p=18}} In 1987, [[Edred Thorsson]] and James Chisholm founded [[The Troth]], which was incorporated in [[Texas]]. Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1996|1pp=213&ndash;215|2a1=Paxson|2y=2002|2p=18}}\n\n==Terminology==\nIn English usage, the genitive ''{{lang|is|\u00c1satr\u00faar}}'' \"of \u00c6sir faith\" is often used on its own to denote adherents (both singular and plural).{{sfnm|1a1=Blain|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=Strmiska|2a2=Sigurvinsson|2y=2005|2p=128|3a1=Adler|3y=2006|3p=286|4a1=Harvey|4y=2007|4p=53}} This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of Scandinavia,{{sfn|Strmiska|Sigurvinsson|2005|p=128}} although it is problematic as many Asatruar worship deities and entities other than the \u00c6sir, such as the Vanir, Valkyries, Elves, and Dwarves.{{sfn|Strmiska|2000|p=113}} Other practitioners term their religion ''Vanatr\u00fa'', meaning \"those who honour the Vanir\" or ''D\u00edsitr\u00fa'', meaning \"those who honour the Goddesses\", depending on their particular theological emphasis.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=53}}\n\nWithin the community it is sometimes stated that the term ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' pertains to groups which are not racially focused, while ''Odinism'' is the term preferred by racially oriented groups. However, in practice, there is no such neat division in terminology.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=152}}\n\nThere are notable differences of emphasis between ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' as practiced in the US and in Scandinavia. According to Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), American Asatruar tend to prefer a more devotional form of worship and a more emotional conception of the Nordic gods than Scandinavian practitioners, reflecting the parallel tendency of highly emotional forms of Christianity prevalent in the United States.<ref>\"American Nordic Pagans want to feel an intimate relationship with their gods, not unlike evangelical attitudes towards Jesus. Icelandic Asatruar, by contrast, are more focused on devotion to their past cultural heritage rather than to particular gods.\" Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), p. 165.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAlthough deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the Heathen community in the US, sociologist Jeffrey Kaplan estimated that, in the mid-1990s, there were around 500 active practitioners in the country, with a further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement.{{sfn|Kaplan|1996|p=198}} He noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the movement were white, male, and young. Most had at least an undergraduate degree, and worked in a mix of [[White-collar worker|white collar]] and [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar jobs]].{{sfn|Kaplan|1996|p=199}} From her experience within the community, Snook concurred that the majority of American Heathens were male, adding also that most were also white and middle-aged,{{sfn|Snook|2015|p=24}} but believed that there had been a growth in the proportion of Heathen women in the US since the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Snook|2015|p=108}}\n\nThe Pagan Census project led by [[Helen A. Berger]], Evan A. Leach, and Leigh S. Shaffer gained 60 responses from Heathens in the US, noting that 65% were male and 35% female, which they saw as the \"opposite\" of the rest of the country's Pagan community.{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|p=16}} The majority had a college education, but were generally less well educated than the wider Pagan community, with a lower median income than the wider Pagan community too.{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|p=16}} \nSubsequent assessments have suggested a larger support base; 10,000 to 20,000 according to McNallen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205271,00.html|title=Viking Mythology Grows As Religion for Inmates|work=Associated Press|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> and 7,878 according to the 2014 census.<ref name=Seigfried>{{cite web|url=http://www.norsemyth.org/2014/01/worldwide-heathen-census-2013-results.html|title=The Norse Mythology Blog: WORLDWIDE HEATHEN CENSUS 2013: RESULTS & ANALYSIS \u2013 Articles & Interviews on Myth & Religion|publisher=|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Politics and controversies==\n\u00c1satr\u00fa organizations have memberships which span the entire political and spiritual spectrum. There is a history of political controversy within organized US \u00c1satr\u00fa, mostly surrounding the question of how to deal with such adherents as place themselves in a context of the [[far right]] and [[white supremacy]], notably resulting in the fragmentation of the ''Asatru Free Assembly'' in 1986.\n\nExternally, political activity on the part of \u00c1satr\u00fa organizations has surrounded campaigns against alleged [[Religious discrimination against Neopagans|religious discrimination]], such as the call for the introduction of an \u00c1satr\u00fa \"emblem of  belief\"  by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] to parallel the Wiccan pentacle granted to the widow of [[Patrick Stewart (soldier)|Patrick Stewart]] in 2006. In May 2013, the \"[[Mj\u00f6lnir|Hammer of Thor]]\" was added to the list of [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=National Cemetery Administration: Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers|url=http://www.cem.va.gov/hmm/emblems.asp|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=12 May 2013|quote=55 \u2013 Hammer of Thor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Elysia|title=Hammer of Thor now VA accepted symbol of faith|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/blog/2013/05/hammer-of-thor-now-va-accepted-symbol-of-faith/|publisher=Llewellyn|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Folkish \u00c1satr\u00fa, Universalism and racialism===\n{{Further|Neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements#Nordic racial paganism}}\n\nHistorically, the main dispute between the national organizations has generally centered on the interpretation of \"Nordic heritage\" as either something cultural, or as something genetic or racial. In the internal discourse within American \u00c1satr\u00fa, this cultural/racial divide has long been known as \"universalist\" vs. \"folkish\" \u00c1satr\u00fa.<ref>Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), p. 134f.</ref>  \n \n[[The Troth]] takes the \"universalist\" position,  claiming ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' as a synonym for \"Northern European Heathenry\" taken to comprise \"many variations, names, and practices, including [[Theodism]], Irminism, Odinism, and Anglo-Saxon Heathenry\". The [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] takes the folkish position, claiming that \u00c1satr\u00fa and the Germanic beliefs are ancestral in nature, and as an indigenous religion of the European Folk should only be accessed by the descendants of Europe. In the [[Neopaganism in the United Kingdom|UK]], Germanic Neopaganism is more commonly known as [[Odinism]] or as ''Heathenry''.  This is mostly a matter of terminology, and US \u00c1satr\u00fa may be equated with UK Odinism for practical purposes, as is evident in the short-lived [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]] of folkish \u00c1satr\u00fa/Odinist groups.\n\nSome groups identifying as  \u00c1satr\u00fa have been associated with [[national socialist]] and [[white nationalist]] movements.<ref name=\"Gods of the Blood\">{{cite book | first =Matthias | last =Gardell | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2003 | month = | title =Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =269\u2013283 | publisher =Duke University Press | location = | isbn =0-8223-3071-7 | url = }}</ref> [[Wotansvolk]] for example is an explicitly racial form.\n\nMore recently, however, many \u00c1satr\u00fa groups have been taking a harder stance against these elements of their community.

It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay.\n\nAs a name for such a device, the word \"ansible\" first appeared in a 1966 novel by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. Since that time, the term has been broadly used in the works of numerous science fiction authors, across a variety of settings and continuities.<ref name=Sheidlower/>\n\n== Coinage by Ursula Le Guin ==\n[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] [[neologism|coined]] the word \"ansible\" in her 1966 novel ''[[Rocannon's World]]''.<ref name=Sheidlower/><ref name=Bernardo/> The word was a contraction of \"answerable\", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over [[interstellar communication|interstellar]] distances.<ref name=Quinion/>\n\nAlthough Le Guin invented the name \"ansible\" for this type of device, fleshed out with specific details in her fictional works, the broader concept of instantaneous or [[faster-than-light communication]] had previously existed in science fiction. For example, similar communication functions were included in a device called an [[interocitor]] in the 1952 novel ''[[This Island Earth (novel)|This Island Earth]]'' by [[Raymond F. Jones]], and [[This Island Earth|the 1955 film]] based on that novel.\n\n== In Le Guin's works ==\nIn her subsequent works, Le Guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible:\n\n* ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', Le Guin's award-winning 1974 novel in the [[Hainish Cycle]], tells of the invention of the ansible.<ref name=LeGuin1974/>\n\n* In ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one \"must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos.\"\n\n* In ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', it is stated that the ansible \"doesn't involve radio waves, or any form of energy. The principle it works on, the constant of [[simultaneity]], is analogous in some ways to [[gravity]]&nbsp;... One point has to be fixed, on a planet of certain mass, but the other end is portable.\"\n\nAny ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging.\n\n== Use by later authors ==\nSince Le Guin's conception of the ansible, the name of the device has been borrowed by numerous authors. While Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate \"instantaneously\",<ref name=LeGuin1974/> the name has also been adopted for devices capable of communication at finite speeds that are faster than light.\n\n=== Orson Scott Card's works ===\n[[Orson Scott Card]], in his 1977 book ''[[Ender's Game]]'' and [[Ender's Game (series)|its sequels]], used the term \"ansible\" for his own fictitious communication device.<ref name=Card1977/> In ''Ender's Game'', a character stated that \"somebody dredged the name ''ansible'' out of an old book somewhere.\"<ref name=Card1977/>\n\nIn the universe of the [[Ender's Game (series)|''Ender's Game'' series]], the ansible's functions involved a fictional subatomic particle, the philote.<ref name=Card1991/> The two [[quark]]s inside a [[pion|pi meson]] can be separated by an arbitrary distance, while remaining connected by \"philotic rays\".<ref name=Card1991/> This concept is similar to [[quantum teleportation]] due to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]]; however, in reality, [[quark confinement]] prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance.\n\nCard's version of the ansible was also featured in the video game ''[[Advent Rising]]'', for which Card helped write the story, and in the movie ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]'', which was based on the book.<ref name=EnderScript/>\n\n=== Other writers ===\nNumerous other writers have included ansibles in their fictional works, using that word to refer to a faster-than-light communication device.

After six years of prayer and preaching, he had made little headway in evangelizing the Bohemians, who maintained deeply embedded pagan beliefs.\n\nAdalbert opposed the participation of Christians in the [[slavery|slave]] trade and complained of [[polygamy]] and idolatry, which were common among the people. Once he started to propose reforms he was met with opposition from both the secular powers and the clergy. His family refused to support Duke [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus]] in an unsuccessful war against Poland. Adalbert was no longer welcome and eventually forced into exile.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 990 he went to [[Rome]]. He lived as a hermit at the Benedictine [[Santi Bonifacio e Alessio|monastery of Saint Alexis]]. Five years later, Boleslaus requested that the [[Pope]] send Adalbert back to Prague, in hopes of securing his family's support. [[Pope John XV]] agreed, with the understanding that Adalbert was free to leave Prague if he continued to encounter entrenched resistance. Adalbert returned as bishop of Prague, where he was initially received with demonstrations of apparent joy. and founded a [[Brevnov Monastery|monastery in B\u0159evnov]] near the City, it being the first monastery in the Czech territory.\n\nIn 995, the [[Slavniks]]' former rivalry with the P\u0159emyslids, who were allied with the powerful Bohemian clan of the [[Vr\u0161ovci]]s, resulted in the storming of the Slavnik town of [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], led by the P\u0159emyslid [[Boleslaus II the Pious]]. During the struggle four or five of Adalbert's brothers were killed. The Zli\u010dan principality became part of the P\u0159emyslids' estate. Adalbert unsuccessfully attempted to protect a noblewoman caught in adultery. She had fled to a convent, where she was killed. In upholding the right of sanctuary, Bishop Adalbert responded by excommunicating the murderers. Butler suggests that the incident was orchestrated by enemies of his family.{{sfn|Butler|2003|p=181}}\n\nAfter this, Adalbert could not safely stay in Bohemia and escaped from Prague. Strachkvas was eventually appointed to be his successor. However, Strachkvas suddenly died during the liturgy at which he was to accede to his episcopal office in Prague. The cause of his death is still ambiguous. The Pope directed Adalbert to resume his see, but believing that he would not be allowed back, he requested a brief as an itinerant missionary.<ref name=\"Foley\" />\n\nAdalbert then traveled to [[Hungary]] and probably baptized [[G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|G\u00e9za of Hungary]] and his son [[Stephen of Hungary|Stephen]] in [[Esztergom]]. Then he went to [[Poland]] where he was cordially welcomed by [[Boleslaus I of Poland|then-Duke Boleslaus I]] and installed as Bishop of [[Gniezno]].\n\n===Mission and Martyrdom in Prussia===\n[[File:Adalb.jpg|thumb|The execution of St. Adalbert by the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Gniezno Doors]] panel]]\n\nAdalbert again relinquished his diocese, namely that of [[Gniezno]], and set out as a missionary to preach to the inhabitants near [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]].<ref>[http://saints.sqpn.com/book-of-saints-adalbert Monks of Ramsgate. \u201cAdalbert\u201d, ''Book of Saints'' (1921)]</ref> [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], Duke (and, later, King) of Poland, sent [[soldiers]] with Adalbert on his mission to the Prussians. The Bishop and his companions, including his half-brother Radim (Gaudentius), entered Prussian territory and traveled along the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] to [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nSuccess attended his efforts at first, but his imperious manner in commanding the people to abandon paganism irritated them, and at the instigation of one of the pagan priests he was murdered on 23 April 997 on the Baltic Sea coast east of [[Truso]] (currently the city of [[Elbl\u0105g]]) or near Tenkitten and [[Fischhausen]]. It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in [[gold]] by King [[Boleslaus I of Poland]].\n\n==Veneration and Relics==\n[[File:Relikwiarz Swietego Wojciecha.JPG|thumb|upright|Silver coffin of St. Adalbert, Cathedral in [[Gniezno]]]]\nA few years after his martyrdom, Adalbert was [[canonization|canonized]] as '''St. Adalbert of Prague.''' His life was written in ''Vita Sancti Adalberti Pragensis'' by various authors, the earliest being traced to imperial [[Aachen]] and the Bishop of [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Notger von L\u00fcttich]], although it was previously assumed that the [[Rome|Roman]] monk [[John Canaparius]] wrote the first ''Vita'' in 999. Another famous biographer of St. Adalbert was [[Bruno of Querfurt|St. Bruno of Querfurt]] who wrote a hagiography of him in 1001-4.\n\nNotably, the P\u0159emyslid rulers of Bohemia initially refused to ransom St. Adalbert's body from the Prussians who murdered him, and therefore it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by the Saint belonging to the Slavniks family which was rival to the P\u0159emyslids. Thus St. Adalbert's bones were preserved in [[Gniezno]], which assisted [[Boleslaus I of Poland]] in increasing Polish political and diplomatic power in Europe.\n\nAccording to Bohemian accounts, in 1039 the Bohemian Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|B\u0159etislav I]] looted the bones of St. Adalbert from [[Gniezno]] in a raid and translated them to [[Prague]]. According to Polish accounts, however, he stole the wrong relics, namely those of [[St. Gaudentius]], while the Poles concealed St. Adalbert's relics which remain in [[Gniezno]]. In 1127 his severed head, which was not in the original purchase according to ''Roczniki Polskie'', was discovered and translated to [[Gniezno]]. In 1928, one of the arms of St. Adalbert, which Boles\u0142aw I had given to [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto III]] in 1000, was added to the bones preserved in Gniezno. Therefore, today St. Adalbert has two elaborate shrines in the [[Prague Cathedral]] and [[Gniezno Cathedral|Royal Cathedral of Gniezno]], each of which claims to possess his relics, but which of these bones are his authentic relics is unknown. For example, pursuant to both claims the Saint has two skulls. The one in Gniezno was stolen in 1923.\n\nThe massive bronze [[Gniezno Doors|doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]], dating from around 1175, are decorated with eighteen [[relief]]s of scenes from the Saint's life. They are the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] ecclesiastical doors in Europe depicting a cycle illustrating the life of a saint, and therefore are a precious relic documenting Adalbert's martyrdom.\n\nThe one thousandth anniversary of St. Adalbert's martyrdom was on 23 April 1997. It was commemorated in [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and other nations. Representatives of [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches traveled on a pilgrimage to the Saint's tomb located in Gniezno. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the cathedral and celebrated a liturgy there in which heads of seven European nations and approximately one million faithful participated.\n\nA ten-meter cross was erected near the village of Beregovoe (formerly Tenkitten), [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], where St. Adalbert is thought to have been martyred by the Prussians.\n\n===Churches and parishes named for St. Adalbert===\n{{Main article|St. Adalbert's Church (disambiguation){{!}}St. Adalbert's Church}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Saints}}\n\n* [[History of the Czech lands in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[History of Poland (966\u20131385)]]\n* [[Congress of Gniezno]]\n* [[Gniezno Doors]]\n* [[Adalbert of Magdeburg|St. Adalbert of Magdeburg]]\n* [[Statue of Adalbert of Prague, Charles Bridge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Alban|title=Butler's Lives of the Saints|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHnM1a1NTugC&pg=PA181|year=2003|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-2903-1|pages=181\u2013|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Vlasto|first=A.

A standard first example of a ''K''-algebra is a ring of [[Square matrix|square matrices]] over a field ''K'', with the usual [[matrix multiplication]]. \n\nIn this article associative algebras are assumed to have a multiplicative unit, denoted 1; they are sometimes called '''unital associative algebras''' for clarification. In some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made, and we will call such structures [[unital algebra|non-unital]] associative algebras. We will also assume that all rings are unital, and all ring homomorphisms are unital.\n\nMany authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', instead of a field: An '''''R''-algebra''' is an [[Module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] with an associative ''R''-bilinear binary operation, which also contains a multiplicative identity. For examples of this concept, if ''S'' is any ring with [[center (ring theory)|center]] ''C'', then ''S'' is an associative ''C''-algebra.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Algebra}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nLet ''R'' be a fixed [[commutative ring]] (so ''R'' could be a field). An '''associative ''R''-algebra''' (or more simply, an '''''R''-algebra''') is an additive [[abelian group]] ''A'' which has the structure of both a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] in such a way that the [[scalar multiplication]] satisfies\n:<math>r\\cdot(xy) = (r\\cdot x)y = x(r\\cdot y)</math>\nfor all ''r'' \u2208 ''R'' and ''x'', ''y'' \u2208 ''A''. Furthermore, ''A'' is assumed to be unital, which is to say it contains an element 1 such that\n:<math>1 x = x = x 1 </math>\nfor all ''x'' \u2208 ''A''. Note that such an element 1 must be unique.\n\nIn other words, ''A'' is an ''R''-module together with (1) an [[bilinear map|''R''-bilinear map]] ''A'' &times; ''A'' \u2192 ''A'', called the multiplication, and (2) the multiplicative identity, such that the multiplication is associative:\n:<math>x(yz) = (xy)z\\,</math>\nfor all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''A''. (Technical note: the multiplicative identity is a datum,<ref>Put in another way, there is the forgetful functor from the category of unital associative algebras to the category of possibly non-unital associative algebras.</ref> while associativity is a property. By the uniqueness of the multiplicative identity, \"unitarity\" is often treated like a property.) If one drops the requirement for the associativity, then one obtains a [[non-associative algebra]].\n\nIf ''A'' itself is commutative (as a ring) then it is called a '''commutative ''R''-algebra'''.\n\n=== As a monoid object in the category of modules ===\nThe definition is equivalent to saying that a unital associative ''R''-algebra is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid object]] in [[category of modules|'''''R''-Mod''']] (the [[monoidal category]] of ''R''-modules). By definition, a ring is a monoid object in the [[category of abelian groups]]; thus, the notion of an associative algebra is obtained by replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of modules.\n\nPushing this idea further, some authors have introduced a \"generalized ring\" as a monoid object in some other category that behaves like the category of modules. Indeed, this reinterpretation allows one to avoid making an explicit reference to elements of an algebra ''A''. For example, the associativity can be expressed as follows. By the universal property of a [[tensor product of modules]], the multiplication (the ''R''-bilinear map) corresponds to a unique ''R''-linear map\n:<math>m: A \\otimes_R A \\to A</math>.\nThe associativity then refers to the identity:\n:<math>m \\circ (\\operatorname {id} \\otimes m) = m \\circ (m \\otimes \\operatorname {id}).</math>\n\n===From ring homomorphisms===\nAn associative algebra amounts to a [[ring homomorphism]] whose image lies in the center. Indeed, starting with a ring ''A'' and a ring homomorphism <math>\\eta\\colon R \\to A</math> whose image lies in the [[center (ring theory)|center]] of ''A'', we can make ''A'' an ''R''-algebra by defining\n:<math>r\\cdot x = \\eta(r)x</math>\nfor all ''r'' \u2208 ''R'' and ''x'' \u2208 ''A''. If ''A'' is an ''R''-algebra, taking ''x'' = 1, the same formula in turn defines a ring homomorphism <math>\\eta\\colon R \\to A</math> whose image lies in the center.\n\nIf ''A'' is commutative then the center of ''A'' is equal to ''A'', so that a commutative ''R''-algebra can be defined simply as a homomorphism <math>\\eta\\colon R \\to A</math> of commutative rings.\n\nThe ring homomorphism \u03b7 appearing in the above is often called a [[structure map]]. In the commutative case, one can consider the category whose objects are ring homomorphisms ''R'' \u2192 ''A''; i.e., commutative ''R''-algebras and whose morphisms are ring homomorphisms ''A'' \u2192 ''A{{'}}'' that are under ''R''; i.e., ''R'' \u2192 ''A'' \u2192 ''A{{'}}'' is ''R'' \u2192 ''A{{'}}'' (i.e., the [[coslice category]] of the category of commutative rings under ''R''.)  The [[prime spectrum]] functor Spec then determines an anti-equivalence of this category to the category of [[affine scheme]]s over Spec ''R''.\n\nHow to weaken the commutativity assumption is a subject matter of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and, more recently, of [[derived algebraic geometry]]. See also: [[generic matrix ring]].\n\n==Algebra homomorphisms==\n{{main|algebra homomorphism}}\nA [[homomorphism]] between two ''R''-algebras is an [[module homomorphism|''R''-linear]] [[ring homomorphism]]. Explicitly, <math>\\varphi : A_1 \\to A_2</math> is an '''associative algebra homomorphism''' if\n:<math>\\varphi(r\\cdot x) = r\\cdot \\varphi(x)</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(x+y) = \\varphi(x)+\\varphi(y)\\,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y)\\,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(1) = 1\\,</math>\n\nThe class of all ''R''-algebras together with algebra homomorphisms between them form a [[category (mathematics)|category]], sometimes denoted '''''R''-Alg'''.\n\nThe [[subcategory]] of commutative ''R''-algebras can be characterized as the [[coslice category]] ''R''/'''CRing''' where '''CRing''' is the [[category of commutative rings]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe most basic example is a ring itself; it is an algebra over its center or any subring lying in the center. In particular, any commutative ring is an algebra over any of its subrings. Other examples abound both from algebra and other fields of mathematics.\n\n'''Algebra'''\n*Any ring ''A'' can be considered as a '''Z'''-algebra. The unique ring homomorphism from '''Z''' to ''A'' is determined by the fact that it must send 1 to the identity in A. Therefore, rings and '''Z'''-algebras are equivalent concepts, in the same way that [[abelian group]]s and '''Z'''-modules are equivalent. \n*Any ring of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''n'' is a ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')-algebra in the same way.\n*Given an ''R''-module ''M'', the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''M'', denoted End<sub>''R''</sub>(''M'') is an ''R''-algebra by defining (''r''\u00b7\u03c6)(''x'') = ''r''\u00b7\u03c6(''x'').\n*Any ring of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with coefficients in a commutative ring ''R'' forms an ''R''-algebra under matrix addition and multiplication. This coincides with the previous example when ''M'' is a finitely-generated, [[free module|free]] ''R''-module.\n* The square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from the field ''K'' form an associative algebra over ''K''. In particular, the [[2 &times; 2 real matrices]] form an associative algebra useful in plane mapping.\n* The [[complex number]]s form a 2-dimensional associative algebra over the [[real number]]s.\n* The [[quaternion]]s form a 4-dimensional associative algebra over the reals (but not an algebra over the complex numbers, since the complex numbers are not in the center of the quaternions).\n* The [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients form an associative algebra over the reals.\n* Every [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>] is a commutative ''R''-algebra. In fact, this is the free commutative ''R''-algebra on the set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}.\n* The [[free algebra|free ''R''-algebra]] on a set ''E'' is an algebra of polynomials with coefficients in ''R'' and noncommuting indeterminates taken from the set ''E''.\n* The [[tensor algebra]] of an ''R''-module is naturally an ''R''-algebra. The same is true for quotients such as the [[exterior algebra|exterior]] and [[symmetric algebra]]s. Categorically speaking, the [[functor]] which maps an ''R''-module to its tensor algebra is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ''R''-module (forgetting the ring structure).\n*The following ring is used in the theory of [[\u03bb-ring]]s. Given a commutative ring ''A'', let <math>G(A) = 1 + tA[\\![t]\\!]</math>, the set of formal power series with constant term 1. It is an abelian group with the group operation that is the multiplication of power series. It is then a ring with the mutliplication, denoted by <math>\\circ</math>, such that <math>(1 + at) \\circ (1 + bt) = 1 + abt</math>, determined by this condition and the ring axioms. The additive identity is 1 and the multiplicative identity is <math>1 + t</math>. Then <math>A</math> has a canonical structure of a <math>G(A)</math>-algebra given by the ring homomorphism\n*:<math>G(A) \\to A, \\, 1 + \\sum_{i > 0} a_i t^i \\mapsto a_1</math>.\n:On the other hand, if ''A'' is a \u03bb-ring, then there is a ring homomorphism\n::<math>A \\to G(A), \\, a \\mapsto 1 + \\sum_{i > 0} \\lambda^i(a)t^i</math>,\n:giving <math>G(A)</math> a structure of an ''A''-algebra.\n\n'''Representation theory'''\n* The [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra is an associative algebra that can be used to study the given Lie algebra.\n* If ''G'' is a group and ''R'' is a commutative ring, the set of all functions from ''G'' to ''R'' with finite support form an ''R''-algebra with the convolution as multiplication. It is called the [[group algebra]] of ''G''. The construction is the starting point for the application to the study of (discrete) groups.\n* If ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] (e.g., semisimple [[complex Lie group]]), then the [[coordinate ring]] of ''G'' is the [[Hopf algebra]] ''A'' corresponding to ''G''. Many structures of ''G'' translate to those of ''A''.\n\n'''Analysis'''\n* Given any [[Banach space]] ''X'', the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear operator]]s ''A'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' form an associative algebra (using composition of operators as multiplication); this is a [[Banach algebra]].\n* Given any [[topology|topological space]] ''X'', the continuous real- or complex-valued functions on ''X'' form a real or complex associative algebra; here the functions are added and multiplied pointwise.\n* The set of [[semimartingale]]s defined on the [[filtration (mathematics)#Measure theory|filtered probability space]] (&Omega;,''F'',(''F''<sub>''t''</sub>)<sub>''t''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0</sub>,P) forms a ring under [[stochastic calculus|stochastic integration]].\n* The [[Weyl algebra]]\n* An [[Azumaya algebra]]\n\n'''Geometry and combinatorics'''\n* The [[Clifford algebra]]s, which are useful in [[geometry]] and [[physics]].\n* [[Incidence algebra]]s of locally finite [[partially ordered set]]s are associative algebras considered in [[combinatorics]].\n\n==Constructions==\n;Subalgebras: A subalgebra of an ''R''-algebra ''A'' is a subset of ''A'' which is both a [[subring]] and a [[submodule]] of ''A''. That is, it must be closed under addition, ring multiplication, scalar multiplication, and it must contain the identity element of ''A''.\n;Quotient algebras: Let ''A'' be an ''R''-algebra. Any ring-theoretic [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' in ''A'' is automatically an ''R''-module since ''r''\u00b7''x'' = (''r''1<sub>''A''</sub>)''x''. This gives the [[quotient ring]] ''A''/''I'' the structure of an ''R''-module and, in fact, an ''R''-algebra. It follows that any ring homomorphic image of ''A'' is also an ''R''-algebra.\n;Direct products: The direct product of a family of ''R''-algebras is the ring-theoretic direct product. This becomes an ''R''-algebra with the obvious scalar multiplication.\n;Free products: One can form a [[free product of associative algebras|free product]] of ''R''-algebras in a manner similar to the free product of groups. The free product is the [[coproduct]] in the category of ''R''-algebras.\n;Tensor products: The tensor product of two ''R''-algebras is also an ''R''-algebra in a natural way. See [[tensor product of algebras]] for more details. Given a commutative ring ''R'' and any ring ''A'' the [[tensor product of rings|tensor product]] ''R''\u2297<sub>'''Z'''</sub>''A'' can be given the structure of an ''R''-algebra by defining ''r''\u00b7(''s''\u2297''a'') = (''rs''\u2297''a''). The functor which sends ''A'' to ''R''\u2297<sub>'''Z'''</sub>''A'' is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ring (forgetting the module structure). See also: [[change of rings]].\n\n==Coalgebras==\n{{Main|Coalgebra}}\nAn associative algebra over ''K'' is given by a ''K''-vector space ''A'' endowed with a bilinear map ''A''&times;''A''\u2192''A'' having 2 inputs (multiplicator and multiplicand) and one output (product), as well as a morphism ''K''\u2192''A'' identifying the scalar multiples of the multiplicative identity. If the bilinear map ''A''&times;''A''\u2192''A'' is reinterpreted as a linear map (i. e., [[morphism]] in the category of ''K''-vector spaces) ''A''&otimes;''A''\u2192''A'' (by the [[Tensor product#Characterization by a universal property|universal property of the tensor product]]), then we can view an associative algebra over ''K'' as a ''K''-vector space ''A'' endowed with two morphisms (one of the form ''A''&otimes;''A''\u2192''A'' and one of the form ''K''\u2192''A'') satisfying certain conditions which boil down to the algebra axioms. These two morphisms can be dualized using [[categorial duality]] by reversing all arrows in the [[commutative diagram]]s which describe the algebra [[axiom]]s; this defines the structure of a [[coalgebra]].\n\nThere is also an abstract notion of [[F-coalgebra]], where ''F'' is a [[functor]]. This is vaguely related to the notion of coalgebra discussed above.\n\n==Representations==\n{{main|Algebra representation}}\nA [[representation theory|representation]] of an algebra ''A'' is an algebra homomorphism \u03c1: ''A'' \u2192 End(''V'') from ''A'' to the endomorphism algebra of some vector space (or module) ''V''. The property of \u03c1 being an algebra homomorphism means that \u03c1 preserves the multiplicative operation (that is, \u03c1(''xy'')=\u03c1(''x'')\u03c1(''y'') for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''), and that \u03c1 sends the unity of ''A'' to the unity of End(''V'') (that is, to the identity endomorphism of ''V'').\n\nIf ''A'' and ''B'' are two algebras, and \u03c1: ''A'' \u2192 End(''V'') and &tau;: ''B'' \u2192 End(''W'') are two representations, then there is a (canonical) representation ''A <math>\\otimes</math> B'' \u2192 End(''V <math>\\otimes</math> W'') of the tensor product algebra ''A <math>\\otimes</math> B'' on the vector space ''V <math>\\otimes</math> W''. However, there is no natural way of defining a [[tensor product]] of two representations of a single associative algebra in such a way that the result is still a representation of that same algebra (not of its tensor product with itself), without somehow imposing additional conditions. Here, by ''[[tensor product of representations]]'',  the usual meaning is intended: the result should be a linear representation of the same algebra on the product vector space. Imposing such additional structure typically leads to the idea of a [[Hopf algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]], as demonstrated below.\n\n===Motivation for a Hopf algebra===\nConsider, for example, two representations <math>\\sigma:A\\rightarrow \\mathrm{End}(V)</math> and <math>\\tau:A\\rightarrow \\mathrm{End}(W)</math>.  One might try to form a tensor product representation <math>\\rho: x \\mapsto \\sigma(x) \\otimes \\tau(x)</math> according to how it acts on the product vector space, so that\n\n:<math>\\rho(x)(v \\otimes w) = (\\sigma(x)(v)) \\otimes (\\tau(x)(w)).</math>\n\nHowever, such a map would not be linear, since one would have\n\n:<math>\\rho(kx) = \\sigma(kx) \\otimes \\tau(kx) = k\\sigma(x) \\otimes k\\tau(x) = k^2 (\\sigma(x) \\otimes \\tau(x)) = k^2 \\rho(x)</math>\n\nfor ''k'' \u2208 ''K''. One can rescue this attempt and restore linearity by imposing additional structure, by defining an algebra homomorphism \u0394: ''A'' \u2192 ''A'' &otimes; ''A'', and defining the tensor product representation as\n\n:<math>\\rho = (\\sigma\\otimes \\tau) \\circ \\Delta.</math>\n\nSuch a homomorphism \u0394 is called a [[comultiplication]] if it satisfies certain axioms.  The resulting structure is called a [[bialgebra]].  To be consistent with the definitions of the associative algebra, the coalgebra must be co-associative, and, if the algebra is unital, then the co-algebra must be co-unital as well. A [[Hopf algebra]] is a bialgebra with an additional piece of structure (the so-called antipode), which allows not only to define the tensor product of two representations, but also the Hom module of two representations (again, similarly to how it is done in the representation theory of groups).\n\n===Motivation for a Lie algebra===\n{{See also|Lie algebra representation}}\nOne can try to be more clever in defining a tensor product. Consider, for example,\n\n:<math>x \\mapsto \\rho (x) = \\sigma(x) \\otimes \\mbox{Id}_W + \\mbox{Id}_V \\otimes \\tau(x)</math>\n\nso that the action on the tensor product space is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho(x) (v \\otimes w) = (\\sigma(x) v)\\otimes w + v \\otimes (\\tau(x) w) </math>.\n\nThis map is clearly linear in ''x'', and so it does not have the problem of the earlier definition.  However, it fails to preserve multiplication:\n\n:<math>\\rho(xy) = \\sigma(x) \\sigma(y) \\otimes \\mbox{Id}_W + \\mbox{Id}_V \\otimes \\tau(x) \\tau(y)</math>.\n\nBut, in general, this does not equal\n\n:<math>\\rho(x)\\rho(y) = \\sigma(x) \\sigma(y) \\otimes \\mbox{Id}_W + \\sigma(x) \\otimes \\tau(y) + \\sigma(y) \\otimes \\tau(x) + \\mbox{Id}_V \\otimes \\tau(x) \\tau(y)</math>.\n\nThis shows that this definition of a tensor product is too naive; the obvious fix is to define it such that it is antisymmetric, so that the middle two terms cancel. This leads to the concept of a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Non-unital algebras==\n\nSome authors use the term \"associative algebra\" to refer to structures which do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity, and hence consider homomorphisms which are not necessarily unital. \n\nAn example of a non-unital associative algebra is given by the set of all functions ''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R''' whose [[limit of a function|limit]] as ''x'' nears infinity is zero.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abstract algebra]]\n* [[Algebraic structure]]\n* [[Algebra over a field]]\n* [[Sheaf of algebras]], a sort of an algebra over a [[ringed space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|author=Bourbaki, N.|title=Algebra I|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=3-540-64243-9}}\n* James Byrnie Shaw (1907) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=05160001 A Synopsis of Linear Associative Algebra], link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs.\n*  Ross Street (1998) ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050825034431/http://www-texdev.ics.mq.edu.au/Quantum/Quantum.ps Quantum Groups: an entr\u00e9e to modern algebra]'', an overview of index-free notation.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Associative Algebra}}\n[[Category:Algebras]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]", "sha1": "rhm9z1mkbm774b90yjn91kjqcqjk33u"}}, {"title": "Axiom of regularity", "ns": "0", "id": "2113", "revision": {"id": "862999067", "parentid": "852542221", "timestamp": "2018-10-08T01:52:35Z", "contributor": {"ip": "128.119.202.183"}, "comment": "/* Regularity in the presence of urelements */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In mathematics, the '''axiom of regularity''' (also known as the '''axiom of foundation''') is an axiom of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] that states that every non-empty [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' contains an element that is [[Disjoint_sets|disjoint]] from ''A''. In [[first-order logic]], the axiom reads:\n: <math>\\forall x\\,(x \\neq \\varnothing \\rightarrow \\exists y \\in x\\,(y \\cap x = \\varnothing))</math>.\nThe axiom implies that no set is an element of itself, and that there is no infinite [[sequence]] (''a<sub>n</sub>'') such that ''a<sub>i+1</sub>'' is an element of ''a<sub>i</sub>'' for all ''i''. With the [[axiom of dependent choice]] (which is a weakened form of the [[axiom of choice]]), this result can be reversed: if there are no such infinite sequences, then the axiom of regularity is true. Hence, the axiom of regularity is equivalent, given the axiom of dependent choice, to the alternative axiom that there are no downward infinite membership chains.\n\nThe axiom of regularity was introduced by {{harvtxt|von Neumann|1925}}; it was adopted in a formulation closer to the one found in contemporary textbooks by {{harvtxt|Zermelo|1930}}. Virtually all results in the branches of mathematics based on set theory hold even in the absence of regularity; see chapter 3 of {{harvtxt|Kunen|1980}}.  However, regularity makes some properties of [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] easier to prove; and it not only allows induction to be done on [[well-ordering|well-ordered sets]] but also on proper classes that are [[well-founded relation|well-founded relational structures]] such as the [[lexicographical ordering]] on <math>\\{ (n, \\alpha) \\vert n \\in \\omega \\land \\alpha \\text{ is an ordinal } \\} \\,.</math>\n\nGiven the other axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the [[epsilon-induction|axiom of induction]]. The axiom of induction tends to be used in place of the axiom of regularity in [[intuitionism|intuitionistic]] theories (ones that do not accept the [[law of the excluded middle]]), where the two axioms are not equivalent.\n\nIn addition to omitting the axiom of regularity, [[Non-well-founded set theory|non-standard set theories]] have indeed postulated the existence of sets that are elements of themselves.\n\n==Elementary implications of regularity==\n\n===No set is an element of itself===\nLet ''A'' be a set, and apply the axiom of regularity to {''A''}, which is a set by the [[axiom of pairing]]. We see that there must be an element of {''A''} which is disjoint from {''A''}. Since the only element of {''A''} is ''A'', it must be that ''A'' is disjoint from {''A''}. So, since ''A'' \u2208 {''A''}, we cannot have ''A'' \u2208 ''A'' (by the definition of [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]).\n\n===No infinite descending sequence of sets exists===\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''f'', on the [[natural number]]s with ''f''(''n''+1) an element of ''f''(''n'') for each ''n''. Define ''S'' = {''f''(''n''): ''n'' a natural number}, the range of ''f'', which can be seen to be a set from the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. Applying the axiom of regularity to ''S'', let ''B'' be an element of ''S'' which is disjoint from ''S''. By the definition of ''S'', ''B'' must be ''f''(''k'') for some natural number ''k''. However, we are given that ''f''(''k'') contains ''f''(''k''+1) which is also an element of ''S''. So ''f''(''k''+1) is in the intersection of ''f''(''k'') and ''S''. This contradicts the fact that they are disjoint sets. Since our supposition led to a contradiction, there must not be any such function, ''f''.\n\nThe nonexistence of a set containing itself can be seen as a special case where the sequence is infinite and constant.\n\nNotice that this argument only applies to functions ''f'' that can be represented as sets as opposed to undefinable classes. The [[hereditarily finite set]]s, V<sub>\u03c9</sub>, satisfy the axiom of regularity (and all other axioms of [[ZFC]] except the [[axiom of infinity]]). So if one forms a non-trivial [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] of V<sub>\u03c9</sub>, then it will also satisfy the axiom of regularity. The resulting [[model (logic)|model]] <!--WHAT model?--> will contain elements, called non-standard natural numbers, that satisfy the definition of natural numbers in that model but are not really natural numbers. They are fake natural numbers which are \"larger\" than any actual natural number. This model will contain infinite descending sequences of elements. For example, suppose ''n'' is a non-standard natural number, then <math>(n-1) \\in n</math> and <math>(n-2) \\in (n-1)</math>, and so on. For any actual natural number ''k'', <math>(n-k-1) \\in (n-k)</math>. This is an unending descending sequence of elements. But this sequence is not definable in the model and thus not a set.  So no contradiction to regularity can be proved.\n\n===Simpler set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair===\nThe axiom of regularity enables defining the ordered pair (''a'',''b'') as <nowiki>{</nowiki>''a'',<nowiki>{</nowiki>''a'',''b''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>. See [[ordered pair]] for specifics. This definition eliminates one pair of braces from the canonical [[Kuratowski]] definition (''a'',''b'') = <nowiki>{{</nowiki>''a''<nowiki>}</nowiki>,<nowiki>{</nowiki>''a'',''b''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>.\n\n=== Every set has an ordinal rank ===\nThis was actually the original form of the axiom in von Neumann's axiomatization.\n\nSuppose ''x'' is any set. Let ''t'' be the [[transitive closure (set)|transitive closure]] of {''x''}. Let ''u'' be the subset of ''t'' consisting of unranked sets. If ''u'' is empty, then ''x'' is ranked and we are done. Otherwise, apply the axiom of regularity to ''u'' to get an element ''w'' of ''u'' which is disjoint from ''u''. Since ''w'' is in ''u'', ''w'' is unranked. ''w'' is a subset of ''t'' by the definition of transitive closure. Since ''w'' is disjoint from ''u'', every element of ''w'' is ranked. Applying the axioms of replacement and union to combine the ranks of the elements of ''w'', we get an ordinal rank for ''w'', to wit <math>\\textstyle \\operatorname{rank} (w) = \\cup \\{ \\operatorname{rank} (z) + 1 \\vert z \\in w \\}</math>. This contradicts the conclusion that ''w'' is unranked. So the assumption that ''u'' was non-empty must be false and ''x'' must have rank.\n\n=== For every two sets, only one can be an element of the other ===\nLet ''X'' and ''Y'' be sets. Then apply the axiom of regularity to the set {''X'',''Y''}. We see there must be an element of {''X'',''Y''} which is also disjoint from it. It must be either ''X'' or ''Y''. By the definition of disjoint then, we must have either ''Y'' is not an element of ''X'' or vice versa.\n\n==The axiom of dependent choice and no infinite descending sequence of sets implies regularity==\nLet the non-empty set ''S'' be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, every element of ''S'' has a non-empty intersection with ''S''. We define a binary relation ''R'' on ''S'' by <math>aRb :\\Leftrightarrow b \\in S \\cap a</math>, which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, there is some sequence (''a<sub>n</sub>'') in ''S'' satisfying ''a<sub>n</sub>Ra<sub>n+1</sub>'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such ''S'' exists.\n\n== Regularity and the rest of ZF(C) axioms ==\nRegularity was shown to be relatively consistent with the rest of ZF by {{harvtxt|Skolem|1923}} and {{harvtxt|von Neumann|1929}}, meaning that if ZF without regularity is consistent, then ZF (with regularity) is also consistent. For his proof in modern notation see {{harvtxt|Vaught|2001|loc=\u00a710.1}} for instance.\n\nThe axiom of regularity was also shown to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] from the other axioms of ZF(C), assuming they are consistent. The result was announced by [[Paul Bernays]] in 1941, although he did not publish a proof until 1954. The proof involves (and led to the study of) [[Rieger-Bernays permutation]] models (or method), which were used for other proofs of independence for non-well-founded systems ({{harvnb|Rathjen|2004|p=193}} and {{harvnb|Forster|2003|pp=210\u2013212}}).\n\n== Regularity and Russell's paradox ==\n[[Naive set theory]] (the axiom schema of [[unrestricted comprehension]] and the [[axiom of extensionality]]) is inconsistent due to [[Russell's paradox]]. In early formalizations of sets, mathematicians and logicians have avoided that contradiction by replacing the axiom schema of comprehension with the much weaker [[axiom schema of separation]]. However, this step alone takes one to theories of sets which are considered too weak. So some of the power of comprehension was added back via the other existence axioms of ZF set theory (pairing, union, powerset, replacement, and infinity) which may be regarded as special cases of comprehension. So far, these axioms do not seem to lead to any contradiction. Subsequently, the axiom of choice and the axiom of regularity were added to exclude models with some undesirable properties. These two axioms are known to be relatively consistent.\n\nIn the presence of the axiom schema of separation, Russell's paradox becomes a proof that there is no [[universal set|set of all sets]]. The axiom of regularity together with the axiom of pairing also prohibit such a universal set.  However, Russell's paradox yields a proof that there is no \"set of all sets\" using the axiom schema of separation alone, without any additional axioms.  In particular, ZF without the axiom of regularity already prohibits such a universal set. \n\nIf a theory is extended by adding an axiom or axioms, then any (possibly undesireable) consequences of the original theory remain consequences of the extended theory. In particular, if ZF without regularity is extended by adding regularity to get ZF, then any contradiction (such as Russell's paradox) which followed from the original theory would still follow in the extended theory.\n\nThe existence of [[Quine atom]]s (sets that satisfy the formula equation ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''x''}, i.e. have themselves as their only elements) is consistent with the theory obtained by removing the axiom of regularity from ZFC. Various [[non-well-founded set theory|non-wellfounded set theories]] allow \"safe\" circular sets, such as Quine atoms, without becoming inconsistent by means of Russell's paradox.{{harv|Rieger|2011|pp=175,178}}\n\n== Regularity, the cumulative hierarchy, and types ==\nIn ZF it can be proven that the class <math> \\bigcup_{\\alpha} V_\\alpha \\! </math>, called the [[von Neumann universe]], is equal to the class of all sets. This statement is even equivalent to the axiom of regularity (if we work in ZF with this axiom omitted). From any model which does not satisfy axiom of regularity, a model which satisfies it can be constructed by taking only sets in <math> \\bigcup_{\\alpha} V_\\alpha \\! </math>.\n\n{{harvs|txt|last=Enderton|first=Herbert|year=1977|loc=p. 206|author-link=Herbert Enderton}} wrote that \"The idea of rank is a descendant of Russell's concept of ''type''\". Comparing ZF with [[type theory]], [[Alasdair Urquhart]] wrote that \"Zermelo's system has the notational advantage of not containing any explicitly typed variables, although in fact it can be seen as having an implicit type structure built into it, at least if the axiom of regularity is included. The details of this implicit typing are spelled out in [[#{{harvid|Zermelo|1930}}|[Zermelo 1930]]], and again in a well-known article of [[George Boolos]] [[#{{harvid|Boolos|1971}}|[Boolos 1971]]].\" {{harvtxt|Urquhart|2003|p=305}}\n\n{{harvs|txt|last=Scott|first=Dana|year=1974|authorlink=Dana Scott}} went further and claimed that:\n\n{{quote|The truth is that there is only one satisfactory way of avoiding the paradoxes: namely, the use of some form of the ''theory of types''. That was at the basis of both Russell's and Zermelo's intuitions. Indeed the best way to regard Zermelo's theory is as a simplification and extension of Russell's. (We mean Russell's ''simple'' theory of types, of course.) The simplification was to make the types ''cumulative''. Thus mixing of types is easier and annoying repetitions are avoided. Once the later types are allowed to accumulate the earlier ones, we can then easily imagine ''extending'' the types into the transfinite&mdash;just how far we want to go must necessarily be left open. Now Russell made his types ''explicit'' in his notation and Zermelo left them ''implicit''. [emphasis in original]}}\n\nIn the same paper, Scott shows that an axiomatic system based on the inherent properties of the cumulative hierarchy turns out to be equivalent to ZF, including regularity.{{harv|L\u00e9vy|2002|p=73}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe concept of well-foundedness and [[Von Neumann universe|rank]] of a set were both introduced by [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] ([[#{{harvid|Mirimanoff|1917}}|1917]]) cf. {{harvtxt|L\u00e9vy|2002|p=68}} and {{harvtxt|Hallett|1986|loc=\u00a74.4, esp. p. 186, 188}}. Mirimanoff called a set ''x'' \"regular\" (French: \"ordinaire\") if every descending chain ''x'' \u220b ''x<sub>1</sub>'' \u220b ''x<sub>2</sub>''  \u220b ... is finite. Mirimanoff however did not consider his notion of regularity (and well-foundedness) as an axiom to be observed by all sets {{harv|Halbeisen|2012|pp=62\u201363}}; in later papers Mirimanoff also explored what are now called [[non-well-founded set theory|non-well-founded sets]] (\"extraordinaire\" in Mirimanoff's terminology) {{harv|Sangiorgi|2011|pp=17\u201319, 26}}.\n\n{{harvtxt|Skolem|1923}} and {{harvtxt|von Neumann|1925}} pointed out that  non-well-founded sets are superfluous (on p.&nbsp;404 in [[#{{harvid|van Heijenoort|1967}}|van Heijenoort's translation]]) and in the same publication von Neumann gives an axiom (p.&nbsp;412 in translation) which excludes some, but not all, non-well-founded sets {{harv|Rieger|2011|p=179}}. In a subsequent publication, {{harvtxt|von Neumann|1928}} gave the following axiom (rendered in modern notation by A. Rieger):\n\n: <math>\\forall x\\,(x \\neq \\emptyset \\rightarrow \\exists y \\in x\\,(y \\cap x = \\emptyset))</math>.\n\n== Regularity in the presence of urelements ==\n\n[[Urelements]] are objects that are not sets, but which can be elements of sets. In ZF set theory, there are no urelements, but in some other set theories such as [[Urelement#Urelements in set theory|ZFA]], there are. In these theories, the axiom of regularity must be modified. The statement \"<math>x \\not = \\emptyset</math>\" needs to be replaced with a statement that <math>x</math> is not empty and is not an urelement. One suitable replacement is <math>(\\exists y)[y \\in x]</math>, which states that ''x'' is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Non-well-founded set theory]]\n*[[Scott's trick]]\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{citation |first=Paul Isaac|last= Bernays|authorlink=Paul Bernays| title= A system of axiomatic set theory.

In developing AIX, IBM and [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] (whom IBM contracted) also incorporated source code from 4.2 and 4.3 [[BSD]] UNIX.\n\nAmong other variants, IBM later produced AIX Version 3 (also known as '''AIX/6000'''), based on System V Release 3, for their [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER]]-based [[RS/6000]] platform. Since 1990, AIX has served as the primary operating system for the RS/6000 series (later renamed ''[[IBM eServer]] pSeries'', then ''[[IBM System p]]'', and now ''[[IBM Power Systems]]''). AIX Version 4, introduced in 1994, added [[symmetric multiprocessing]] with the introduction of the first RS/6000 SMP servers and continued to evolve through the 1990s, culminating with AIX 4.3.3 in 1999. Version 4.1, in a slightly modified form, was also the standard operating system for the [[Apple Network Server]] systems sold by [[Apple Computer]] to complement the [[Macintosh]] line.\n\nIn the late 1990s, under [[Project Monterey]], IBM and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] planned to integrate AIX and [[UnixWare]] into a single [[32-bit]]/[[64-bit computing|64-bit]] multiplatform UNIX with particular emphasis on running on [[Intel]] [[Itanium|IA-64]] (Itanium) architecture CPUs.  A [[beta test]] version of AIX 5L for IA-64 systems was released, but according to documents released in the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit, less than forty licenses for the finished Monterey Unix were ever sold before the project was terminated in 2002.<ref name=\"grok\"/> In 2003, the [[SCO Group]] alleged that (among other infractions) IBM had misappropriated licensed [[source code]] from [[UNIX System V]] Release 4 for incorporation into AIX; SCO subsequently withdrew IBM's license to develop and distribute AIX.  IBM maintains that their license was irrevocable, and continued to sell and support the product until the litigation was adjudicated.\n\nAIX was a component of the 2003 ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit, in which the [[SCO Group]] filed a lawsuit against IBM, alleging IBM contributed SCO's [[intellectual property]] to the [[Linux kernel|Linux]] codebase.  The [[SCO Group]], who argued they were the rightful owners of the copyrights covering the [[Unix]] operating system, attempted to revoke IBM's license to sell or distribute the AIX operating system.  In March 2010, a jury returned a verdict finding that [[Novell]], not the SCO Group, owns the rights to Unix.<ref name=\"Jury verdict 2010\">{{cite web | url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100330152829622 | title=Novell Wins Again&nbsp;\u2014 Jury Rules Copyrights Didn't Go to SCO | accessdate=2010-03-30 | date=2010-03-30}}</ref>\n\nAIX 6 was announced in May 2007, and it ran as an open beta from June 2007 until the general availability (GA) of AIX 6.1 on November 9, 2007.  Major new features in AIX 6.1 included full [[role-based access control]], [[workload partitions]] (which enable application mobility), enhanced security (Addition of AES encryption type for NFS v3 and v4), and [[Live Partition Mobility]] on the POWER6 hardware.\n\nAIX 7.1 was announced in April 2010, and an open beta ran until general availability of AIX 7.1 in September 2010. Several new features, including better scalability, enhanced clustering and management capabilities were added. AIX 7.1 includes a new built-in clustering capability called Cluster Aware AIX. AIX is able to organize multiple LPARs through the multipath communications channel to neighboring CPUs, enabling very high-speed communication between processors. This enables multi-terabyte memory address range and page table access to support global petabyte shared memory space for AIX POWER7 clusters so that software developers can program a cluster as if it were a single system, without using message passing (i.e. semaphore-controlled Inter-process Communication). AIX administrators can use this new capability to cluster a pool of AIX nodes. By default, AIX V7.1 pins kernel memory and includes support to allow applications to pin their kernel stack. Pinning kernel memory and the kernel stack for applications with real-time requirements can provide performance improvements by ensuring that the kernel memory and kernel stack for an application is not paged out.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/\n|title=IBM AIX 7 preview\n|accessdate=2010-04-16\n|publisher=IBM Corporation\n|date=2010-04-16\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAIX 7.2<ref name=\"IBM AIX 7.2 Announcement Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS215-393&appname=USN |title=IBM AIX 7.2 Announcement Letter |publisher=IBM.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref> was announced in October 2015, and released in December 2015. AIX 7.2 principal feature is the Live Kernel Update capability which allows OS fixes to replace the entire AIX kernel with no impact to applications. AIX 7.2 was also restructured to remove obsolete components. The networking component, bos.net.tcp.client was repackaged to allow additional installation flexibility. Unlike AIX 7.1, AIX 7.2 is only supported on systems based on POWER7 or later processors.\n\n==Supported hardware platforms==\n\n===IBM 6150 RT===\nThe original AIX (sometimes called '''AIX/RT''') was developed for the IBM 6150 RT workstation by IBM in conjunction with [[Interactive Systems Corporation]], who had previously ported [[UNIX System III]] to the [[IBM PC]] for IBM as [[PC/IX]].<ref name=\"CW86\"/> According to its developers, the AIX source (for this initial version) consisted of one million lines of code.<ref>{{cite book|title=IBM joins 32-bit fray with RT line|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=33QfOHT69aMC&pg=PA8|date=January 27, 1986|publisher=Computerworld|page=8|issn=0010-4841}}</ref>  Installation media consisted of eight [[Floppy disk|1.2M floppy disk]]s.  The RT was based on the [[ROMP]] [[microprocessor]], the first commercial [[RISC]] chip. This was based on a design pioneered at IBM Research (the [[IBM 801]]) .\n\nOne of the novel aspects of the RT design was the use of a [[microkernel]], called Virtual Resource Manager (VRM).  The keyboard, mouse, display, disk drives and network were all controlled by a microkernel.  One could \"hotkey\" from one operating system to the next using the Alt-Tab key combination. Each OS in turn would get possession of the keyboard, mouse and display. Besides AIX v2, the [[PICK OS]] also included this microkernel.\n\nMuch of the AIX v2 kernel was written in the [[PL/8]] programming language, which proved troublesome during the migration to AIX v3.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  AIX v2 included full [[TCP/IP]] networking, as well as [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] and two networking file systems: [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], licensed from [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[Distributed Services]] (DS).  DS had the distinction of being built on top of SNA, and thereby being fully compatible with DS on the IBM midrange [[IBM System i|AS/400]] and mainframe systems.  For the graphical user interfaces, AIX v2 came with the X10R3 and later the X10R4 and X11 versions of the [[X Window System]] from MIT, together with the [[Xaw|Athena widget set]].  Compilers for [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] were available.  One of the more popular desktop applications was the [[PageMaker]] [[desktop publishing]] software.\n\n===IBM PS/2 series===\n[[File:aixps2.gif|thumb|alt=AIX PS/2 running on Virtual PC|AIX PS/2 running on Virtual PC]]\n\n'''AIX PS/2''' (also known as '''AIX/386''') was developed by [[Locus Computing Corporation]] under contract to IBM.<ref name=\"CW86\">{{cite book|author=Patricia Keefe|title=IBM, Locus to co-develop PS/2 AIX system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGXpro99fIsC&pg=PT7|publisher=Computerworld|page=8|date=July 6, 1986|issn=0010-4841}}</ref>  AIX PS/2, first released in 1987,<ref>{{cite \nweb|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/2/877/ENUSZP87-0422/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en \n|title=IBM AIX PS2 1987 Announcement Letter \n|publisher=IBM.com \n|date= |accessdate=1987-11-03}}</ref>  ran on [[IBM PS/2]] [[personal computer]]s with [[Intel 386]] and compatible processors.\n\nThe product was announced in September 1988 with a baseline tag price of $595, although some utilities like [[uucp]] were included in a separate Extension package priced at $250.

AIX/370 was IBM's fourth attempt to offer [[Unix-like]] functionality for their mainframe line, specifically the [[System/370]] (the prior versions were a [[TSS/360|TSS/370]]-based Unix system developed jointly with AT&T c.1980,<ref name=\"att-s370-unix\"/> a [[VM/370]]-based system named '''VM/IX''' developed jointly with [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] c.1984,{{cn|date=June 2018}} and a [[VM/370]]-based version of TSS/370 named '''IX/370''' which was upgraded to be compatible with [[Unix System V]]{{cn|date=June 2018}}).  AIX/370 was released in 1990 with functional equivalence to System V Release 2 and 4.3BSD as well as IBM enhancements.  With the introduction of the [[ESA/390]] architecture, AIX/370 was replaced by '''AIX/ESA''' in 1991, which was based on [[OSF/1]], and also ran on the [[System/390]] platform.  This development effort was made partly to allow IBM to compete with [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl]] [[UTS (Mainframe UNIX)|UTS]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Unlike AIX/370, AIX/ESA ran both natively as the host operating system, and as a guest under [[VM (Operating system)|VM]].  AIX/ESA, while technically advanced, had little commercial success, partially because UNIX functionality was added as an option to the existing mainframe operating system, [[MVS]], which became [[MVS/ESA|MVS/ESA OpenEdition]] in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n<!-- Blaxthos copyedit anchor, will return soon -->\n\n===IA-64 systems===\nAs part of [[Project Monterey]], IBM released a [[beta test]] version of AIX 5L for the IA-64 ([[Itanium]]) architecture in 2001, but this never became an official product due to lack of interest.<ref \nname=\"grok\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2005082506163768\n| title = 2002 IBM Internal Email on Project Monterey - \"No One Wants It\"\n| accessdate = 2007-05-20\n| last = Jones\n| first = Pamela\n| authorlink = Pamela Jones\n| date = August 25, 2005\n| work = [[Groklaw]]\n}}</ref>\n\n===Apple Network Servers===\nThe [[Apple Network Server]] (ANS) systems were PowerPC-based systems designed by [[Apple Computer]] to have numerous high-end features that standard Apple hardware did not have, including swappable hard drives, redundant power supplies, and external monitoring capability. These systems were more or less based on the [[Power Macintosh]] hardware available at the time but were designed to use AIX (versions 4.1.4 or 4.1.5) as their native operating system in a specialized version specific to the ANS called AIX for Apple Network Servers.\n\nAIX was only compatible with the Network Servers and was not ported to standard Power Macintosh hardware. It should not be confused with [[A/UX]], Apple's earlier version of Unix for [[68k]]-based [[Macintosh]]es.\n\n===POWER/PowerPC-based systems===\n[[File:IBM RS6000 AIX Servers IBM.COM 1998 (1).jpeg|thumb|AIX [[RS/6000]] [[network server|servers]] running ''ibm.com'' in early 1998]]\n[[File:IBM RS6000 AIX Servers IBM.COM 1998 (2).jpeg|thumb|AIX [[RS/6000]] [[network server|servers]] running ''ibm.com'' in early 1998]]\n\nThe release of AIX version 3 (sometimes called '''AIX/6000''') coincided with the announcement of the first [[POWER1]]-based IBM [[RS/6000]] models in 1990.\n\nAIX v3 innovated in several ways on the software side. It was the first operating system to introduce the idea of a [[journaling file system]], [[IBM Journaled File System 2 (JFS2)|JFS]], which allowed for fast boot times by avoiding the need to ensure the consistency of the file systems on disks (see [[fsck]]) on every reboot. Another innovation was [[shared library|shared libraries]] which avoid the need for static linking from an application to the libraries it used. The resulting smaller binaries used less of the hardware RAM to run, and used less disk space to install. Besides improving performance, it was a boon to developers: executable binaries could be in the tens of [[kilobyte]]s instead of a megabyte for an executable statically linked to the [[C library]]. AIX v3 also scrapped the microkernel of AIX v2, a contentious move that resulted in v3 containing no PL/I code and being somewhat more \"pure\" than v2.\n\nOther notable subsystems included:\n\n* [[IRIS GL]], a 3D rendering library, the progenitor of [[OpenGL]]. IRIS GL was licensed by IBM from [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] in 1987, then still a fairly small company, which had sold only a few thousand machines at the time. SGI also provided the low-end graphics card for the RS/6000, capable of drawing 20,000 [[Gouraud shading|gouraud-shaded]] triangles per second. The high-end graphics card was designed by IBM, a follow-on to the mainframe-based [[IBM 5080]], capable of rendering 990,000 vectors per second.\n* [[PHIGS]], another [[3D rendering API]], popular in automotive CAD/CAM circles, and at the core of [[CATIA]].\n* Full implementation of version 11 of the [[X Window System]], together with [[Motif (software)|Motif]] as the recommended widget collection and window manager.\n* Network file systems: [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] from [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]; AFS, the [[Andrew File System]]; and DFS, the [[DCE Distributed File System|Distributed File System]].\n* NCS, the [[Network Computing System]], licensed from [[Apollo Computer]] (later acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]).\n* [[Display PostScript|DPS]] on-screen display system. This was notable as a \"plan B\" in case the X11+Motif combination failed in the marketplace. However, it was highly proprietary, supported only by Sun, [[NeXT]], and IBM. This cemented its failure in the marketplace in the face of the [[Open system (computing)|open system]]s challenge of X11+Motif and its lack of 3D capability.\n\n{{As of|2015}}, AIX runs on IBM [[IBM Power Systems|Power]], [[System p]], [[IBM System i|System i]], System p5, System i5, eServer p5, eServer pSeries and eServer i5 server product lines, as well as IBM [[BladeCenter]] blades<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/v71/index.html\n| title = AIX Version 7.1\n| accessdate = 2011-05-03\n}}</ref> and IBM [[PureFlex]] compute nodes based on Power Architecture technology.\n\n====POWER7 AIX features====\nAIX 7.1 fully exploits systems based on [[POWER7]] processors include the Active Memory Expansion feature, which increases system flexibility where system administrators can configure logical partitions (LPARs) to use less physical memory. For example, an LPAR running AIX appears to the OS applications to be configured with 80 GB of physical memory but the hardware actually only consumes 60 GB of physical memory. Active Memory Expansion is a [[virtual memory compression]] system which employs memory compression technology to transparently compress in-memory data, allowing more data to be placed into memory and thus expanding the memory capacity of POWER7 systems. Using Active Memory Expansion can improve system utilization and increase a system\u2019s throughput. AIX 7 automatically manages the size of memory pages used to automatically use 4&nbsp;KB, 64&nbsp;KB or a combination of those page sizes. This self-tuning feature results in optimized performance without administrative effort.\n\n====POWER8 AIX features====\nAIX 7.2 exploits [[POWER8]] hardware features including accelerators and eight-way hardware multithreading.\n\n==Versions==\n[[File:IBM AIX 53.PNG|thumb|alt=AIX 5.3 welcome banner|The default login banner for AIX 5.3 on PowerPC]]\n\n=== Version history ===\n<!-- Template:Version - for version & release history.

It allows a user to navigate a menu hierarchy of commands, rather than using the command line. Invocation is typically achieved with the command <code>smit</code>. Experienced system administrators make use of the <code>F6</code> function key which generates the command line that SMIT will invoke to complete it.\nSMIT also generates a log of commands that are performed in the <code>smit.script</code> file. The <code>smit.script</code> file automatically records the commands with the command flags and parameters used. The <code>smit.script</code> file can be used as an executable shell script to rerun system configuration tasks. SMIT also creates the <code>smit.log</code> file, which contains additional detailed information that can be used by programmers in extending the SMIT system.\n\n<code>smit</code> and <code>smitty</code> refer to the same program, though <code>smitty</code> invokes the text-based version, while <code>smit</code> will invoke an X Window System based interface if possible; however, if <code>smit</code> determines that X Window System capabilities are not present, it will present the text-based version instead of failing.  Determination of X Window System capabilities is typically performed by checking for the existence of the <code>DISPLAY</code> variable.\n\n==Database==\n'''Object Data Manager''' ('''ODM''') is a database of system information integrated into AIX,<ref>{{cite web|title=Object Data Manager (ODM)|url=http://sysadminexperts.com/basic-aix-course/aix-technical-topic/object-data-manager-odm|website=sysadminexperts.com|publisher=SysAdminExperts|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IBM Knowledge Center: Object data manager|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.genprogc/odm.htm|website=www.ibm.com|publisher=IBM|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> analogous to the [[Windows registry|registry]] in [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref name=\"Nemeth2011\">{{cite book |last=Nemeth |first=Evi |title=UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SIdBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA432 |date=2011 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-148005-6 |pages=432\u2013437 |chapter=Chapter 13.

AppleTalk includes a number of features that allow [[local area network]]s to be connected with no prior setup or the need for a centralized router or server of any sort. Connected AppleTalk-equipped systems automatically assign addresses, update the distributed namespace, and configure any required inter-networking routing.\n\nAppleTalk was released in 1985, and was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. Versions were also released for the [[IBM PC]] and compatibles and the [[Apple IIGS]]. AppleTalk support was also available in most networked printers (especially [[laser printer]]s), some [[file server]]s, and a number of [[router (computing)|router]]s.\n\nThe rise of [[TCP/IP]] during the 1990s led to a reimplementation of most of these types of support on that protocol, and AppleTalk became unsupported as of the release of [[Mac OS X v10.6]] in 2009. Many of AppleTalk's more advanced autoconfiguration features have since been introduced in [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]], while [[Universal Plug and Play]] serves similar needs.\n\n==History==\n\n===AppleNet===\nAfter the release of the [[Apple Lisa]] computer in January 1983, Apple invested considerable effort in the development of a [[local area networking]] (LAN) system for the machines. Known as '''AppleNet''', it was based on the seminal [[Xerox XNS]] [[protocol stack]]<ref>John Markoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-C8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 \"Apple plans slower, affordable local area network\"], ''InfoWorld'', 14 February 1983, p. 14</ref> but running on a custom 1&nbsp;Mbit/s [[coaxial cable]] system rather than Xerox's 2.94 Mbit/s [[Ethernet]]. AppleNet was announced early in 1983 with a fall introduction at the target price of $500 for plug-in AppleNet cards for the Lisa and the [[Apple II]].{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 3}}\n\nAt that time, early LAN systems were just coming to market, including [[Ethernet]], [[Token Ring]] and [[ARCNET]]. This was a topic of major commercial effort at the time, dominating shows like the [[National Computer Conference]] (NCC) in Anaheim in May 1983. All of the systems were jockeying for position in the market, but even at this time Ethernet's widespread acceptance suggested it was to become a ''de facto'' standard.<ref>David Ahl, [http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n8/188_1983_National_Computer_Co.php \"1983 National Computer Conference, May 16-19, Anaheim, California\"], ''Creative Computing'', August 1983, p. 188</ref> It was at this show that [[Steve Jobs]] asked Gursharan Sidhu a seemingly innocuous question, \"Why has networking not caught on?\"{{sfn|Sidhu|Andrews|Oppenheimer|1989|p=xxiii}}\n\nFour months later, in October, AppleNet was cancelled. At the time, they announced that \"Apple realized that it's not in the business to create a networking system. We built and used AppleNet in-house, but we realized that if we had shipped it, we would have seen new standards coming up.\"{{sfn|Bartimo|1984|p=45}} In January, Jobs announced that they would instead be supporting [[IBM]]'s Token Ring, which he expected to come out in a \"few months\".{{sfn|Bartimo|1984|p=45}}\n\n===AppleBus===\nThrough this period, Apple was deep in development of the Macintosh computer. During development, engineers had made the decision to use the [[Zilog SCC|Zilog 8530]] serial controller chip (SCC) instead of the lower cost and more common [[UART]] to provide [[serial port]] connections.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 6}} The SCC cost about $5 more than a UART, but offered much higher speeds up to 250&nbsp;kilobits per second (or higher with additional hardware) and internally supported a number of basic networking-like protocols like IBM's [[Binary Synchronous Communications|Bisync]].<ref>[http://html.alldatasheet.net/html-pdf/96934/ZILOG/Z8530/1414/11/Z8530.html ''Zilog Z8530 User's Manual''], Zilog, p. 1-1</ref>\n\nThe SCC was chosen because it would allow multiple devices to be attached to the port. [[Peripherals]] equipped with similar SCCs could communicate using the built-in protocols, interleaving their data with other peripherals on the same bus. This would eliminate the need for more ports on the back of the machine, and allowed for the elimination of [[expansion slot]]s for supporting more complex devices. The initial concept was known as '''AppleBus''', envisioning a system controlled by the host Macintosh polling \"dumb\" devices in a fashion similar to the modern [[Universal Serial Bus]].{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 9}}\n\n===AppleBus networking===\nThe Macintosh team had already begun work on what would become the [[LaserWriter]], and had considered a number of other options of how to share these expensive machines and other resources. A series of memos from Bob Belleville clarified these concepts, outlining the Mac, LaserWriter and a [[file server]] system which would become [[Macintosh Office]].{{sfn|Sidhu|Andrews|Oppenheimer|1989|p=xxiii}} By late 1983 it was clear that IBM's Token Ring would not be ready in time for the launch of the Mac, and might miss the launch of these other products as well. In the end, Token Ring would not ship until October 1985.<ref>[http://www.techfest.com/networking/lan/token.htm \"Token-Ring Technical Summary\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422020240/http://www.techfest.com/networking/lan/token.htm |date=22 April 2012 }}, Section 1.2</ref>\n\nJobs' earlier question to Sidhu had already sparked a number of ideas. When AppleNet was cancelled in October, Sidhu led an effort to develop a new networking system based on the AppleBus hardware. This new system would not have to conform to any existing preconceptions, and was designed to be worthy of the Mac - a system that was user-installable, had zero-configuration, and no fixed network addresses - in short, a true plug-and-play network.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 10}}{{third-party-inline|date=June 2012}} Considerable effort was needed, but by the time the Mac was released, the basic concepts had been outlined, and some of the low-level protocols were on their way to completion. Sidhu mentioned the work to Belleville only two hours after the Mac was announced.{{sfn|Sidhu|Andrews|Oppenheimer|1989|p=xxiii}}\n\nThe \"new\" AppleBus was announced in early 1984,<ref group=N>AppleBus is mentioned by name in Steve Jobs' introduction of the Macintosh at the Boston Computer Society meeting in 1984. It appears just after the 7:20 mark [http://techland.time.com/2014/01/25/steve-jobs-mac/ in the video].</ref> allowing direct connection from the Mac or Lisa through a small box that plugged into the serial port and connected via cables to the next computer upstream and downstream. Adaptors for [[Apple II]] and [[Apple III]] were also announced.<ref name=jb>Jim Barimo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lC4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45 \"Apple, waiting for IBM net, links micros with AppleBus\"], ''InfoWorld'', 26 March 1984, pp 45-46</ref> Apple also announced that AppleBus networks could be attached to, and would appear to be a single node within, a Token Ring system.{{sfn|Bartimo|1984|p=45}} Details of how this would work were sketchy.{{sfn|Bartimo|1984|p=45}}\n\n===AppleTalk===\nJust prior to its release in early 1985, AppleBus was renamed '''AppleTalk'''. The system had a number of limitations, including a speed of only 230.4&nbsp;kbit/s, a maximum distance of 1000&nbsp;feet from end to end, and only 32 nodes per LAN.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 15}} But as the basic hardware was built into the Mac, adding nodes only cost about $50 for the adaptor box. In comparison, Ethernet or Token Ring cards cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Additionally, the entire [[networking stack]] required only about 6&nbsp;kB of RAM, allowing it to run on any Mac.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 19}}\n\nThe relatively slow speed of AppleTalk allowed further reductions in cost. Instead of using [[RS-422]]'s balanced transmit and receive circuits, the '''AppleTalk Personal Network''' cabling used a single common [[electrical ground]], which limited speeds to about 500&nbsp;kbit/s, but allowed one conductor to be removed. This meant that common three-conductor cables could be used for wiring. Additionally, the adaptors were designed to be \"self-terminating\", meaning that nodes at the end of the network could simply leave their last connector unconnected. There was no need for the wires to be connected back together into a loop, nor the need for hubs or other devices.\n\nThe system was designed for future expansion; the addressing system allowed for expansion to 255 nodes in a LAN (although only 32 could be used at that time), and by using \"bridges\" (which came to be known as \"routers\", although technically not the same) one could interconnect LANs into larger collections. \"Zones\" allowed devices to be addressed within a bridge-connected internet. Additionally, AppleTalk was designed from the start to allow use with any potential underlying physical link.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 17}}\n\nThe main advantage of AppleTalk was that it was completely maintenance-free. To join a device to a network, you simply plugged the adaptor into the machine, then connected a cable from it to any free port on any other adaptor. AppleTalk's internal protocols negotiated a working network address number, automatically gave the computer a human-readable name, and collected up a list of the names and types of other machines on the network so the user could browse the devices through the GUI-based [[Chooser (Mac OS)|Chooser]]. AppleTalk was so easy to use that ad-hoc networks tended to appear whenever multiple Macs were in the same room.<ref>Lee Larson, [http://www.math.louisville.edu/~lee/macwritings/LCN9910.shtml \"LocalTalk to EtherTalk?\"], ''Louisville Computer News'', October 1999</ref> Apple would later use this in an advertisement showing a network being created between two seats in an airplane.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdXp6qLSoTE \"Apple Computer Ad - Powerbook Networking\"]</ref>\n\n===PhoneNet and other adaptors===\nA thriving 3rd party market for AppleTalk devices developed over the next few years. One particularly notable example was an alternate adaptor designed by [[Berkeley Macintosh Users Group|BMUG]] and commercialized by Farallon as [[PhoneNet]] in 1987.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 28}} This was essentially a replacement for Apple's connector that had conventional [[Telephone plug|phone jacks]] instead of Apple's round connectors. PhoneNet allowed AppleTalk networks to be connected together using normal telephone wires, and with very little extra work, could run analog phones and AppleTalk on a single four-conductor phone cable.\n\nOther companies took advantage of the SCC's ability to read external clocks in order to support higher transmission speeds, up to 1&nbsp;Mbit/s. In these systems the external adaptor also included its own [[clock]], and used that to signal the SCC's clock input pins. The best known such system was Centram's '''FlashTalk''', which ran at 768&nbsp;kbit/s, and was intended to be used with their [[TOPS (file server)|TOPS]] networking system.<ref>Tim Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KB0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 \"AppleTalk Made Faster\"], ''Network World'', 26 October 1987, p. 27</ref> A similar solution was the 850&nbsp;kbit/s '''DaynaTalk''', which used a separate box that plugged in between the computer and a normal LocalTalk/PhoneNet box. Dayna also offered a PC expansion card that ran up to 1.7&nbsp;Mbit/s when talking to other Dayna PC cards.<ref>John Battelle, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-7626749/daynatalk-accelerators-ship-product.html \"DaynaTalk accelerators ship\"], ''MacWEEK'', 23 May 1989</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=czAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT70 \"Get More Net Work Out Of Your Network\"], ''InfoWorld'', 11 December 1989</ref> Several other systems also existed with even higher performance, but these often required special cabling that was incompatible with LocalTalk/PhoneNet, and also required patches to the networking stack that often caused problems.\n\n===EtherTalk, TokenTalk and AppleShare===\nBy 1987 Ethernet was clearly winning the standards battle over Token Ring, and in the middle of that year Apple introduced '''EtherTalk 1.0''' for the newly released [[Macintosh II]] computer. The package included both a [[NuBus]] card with Ethernet ports and a new Network [[Control panel (Mac OS)|control panel]] that allowed the user to select which physical connection to use for networking (from \"Built-in\" or \"EtherTalk\"). The release's new networking stack also expanded the system to allow a full 255 nodes per LAN. With its release, AppleTalk Personal Network was renamed '''[[LocalTalk]]'''.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 30}} Token Ring would eventually be supported with the similar '''TokenTalk''' product, which used the same Network control panel and underlying software. Many third party companies would introduce compatible Ethernet and Token Ring cards that used these same drivers.\n\nThe appearance of EtherTalk also led to a problem: Networks with new and old Macs needed some way to communicate between each other. This could be as simple as a network of Ethernet Mac IIs trying to talk to a LaserWriter. Apple had considered the problem, and AppleTalk included the possibility for a low-cost [[LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridge]], but they felt it would be a low-volume product and left it to third parties.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 31}} A number of companies responded, both existing communications vendors like [[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]] and [[Cisco Systems]], as well as newly formed companies like Kinetics. Contrary to Apple's belief these would be low-volume, by the end of 1987, 130,000 such systems were in use. AppleTalk was at that time the most used networking system in the world, with over three times the installations of any other vendor.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 32}}{{third-party-inline|date=June 2012}}\n\n1987 also marked the introduction of the [[AppleShare]] product, a dedicated [[file server]] that ran on any Mac with 512 kB of [[RAM]] or more. A common AppleShare machine was the [[Mac Plus]] with an external [[SCSI]] [[hard drive]]. AppleShare was the #3 [[network operating system]] in the late 1980s, behind [[Novell NetWare]] and Microsoft's [[MS-Net]].<ref>Laura DiDio, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MRMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA17 \"Study finds NetWare to be OS of choice\"], ''Network World'', 11 July 1988, p. 17.</ref> AppleShare was effectively the replacement for the failed Macintosh Office efforts, which had been based on a dedicated file server device.\n\n===AppleTalk Phase II and other developments===\nA significant re-design was released in 1989 as '''AppleTalk Phase II'''. In many ways, Phase II can be considered an effort to make the earlier version (never called Phase I) more generic. LANs could now support more than 255 nodes, and zones were no longer associated with physical networks, but were entirely virtual constructs used simply to organize nodes. For instance, one could now make a \"Printers\" zone that would list all the printers in an organization, or one might want to place that same device in the \"2nd Floor\" zone to indicate its physical location. Phase II also included changes to the underlying inter-networking protocols to make them less \"chatty\", which had previously been a serious problem on networks that bridged over wide-area networks.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 34}}\n\nBy this point Apple had a wide variety of communications products under development, and many of these were announced along with AppleTalk Phase II. These included updates to EtherTalk and TokenTalk, AppleTalk software and LocalTalk hardware for the [[IBM PC]], EtherTalk for Apple's [[A/UX]] [[operating system]] allowing it to use LaserPrinters and other network resources, and the Mac X.25 and [[MacX]] products.\n\nEthernet had become almost universal by 1990, and it was time to build Ethernet into Macs direct from the factory. However, the physical wiring used by these networks was not yet completely standardized. Apple solved this problem using a single port on the back of the computer into which the user could plug an adaptor for any given cabling system. This '''FriendlyNet''' system was based on the industry-standard [[Attachment Unit Interface]] or AUI, but deliberately chose a non-standard connector that was smaller and easier to use, which they called \"Apple AUI\", or '''AAUI'''. FriendlyNet was first introduced on the [[Quadra 700]] and [[Quadra 900]] computers, and used across much of the Mac line for some time.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 36}} As with LocalTalk, a number of 3rd party FriendlyNet adaptors quickly appeared.\n\nAs [[10BASE-T]] became the de facto cabling system for Ethernet, second-generation [[Power Macintosh]] machines added a 10BASE-T port in addition to AAUI. The [[PowerBook 3400c]] and lower-end Power Macs also added 10BASE-T. The [[Power Macintosh 7300]]/[[Power Macintosh 8600|8600]]/[[Power Macintosh 9600|9600]] were the final Macs to include AAUI, and 10BASE-T became universal starting with the [[Power Macintosh G3]] and [[PowerBook G3]].\n\n===The capital-I Internet===\n<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/04/0422mosaic-web-browser/|title=April 22, 1993: Mosaic Browser Lights Up Web With Color, Creativity|last=Calore|first=Michael|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}</ref>In 1988 Apple had released [[MacTCP]], a system that allowed the Mac to support [[TCP/IP]] on machines with suitable Ethernet hardware. However, this left many universities with the problem of supporting IP on their many LocalTalk-equipped Macs. [[Stanford University]] pioneered development of [[MacIP]], which allowed IP packets to be routed over LocalTalk networks with the support of a suitable \"gateway\" machine. These were initially custom devices, but it was soon common to include MacIP support in LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridges.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 36}} MacTCP would not become a standard part of the [[Classic Mac OS]] until 1994,{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 43}} by which time it also supported [[SNMP]] and [[Point-to-point protocol|PPP]].\n\nFor some time in the early 1990s, the Mac was a primary client on the rapidly expanding Internet.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Among the better known programs in wide use were Fetch, Eudora, eXodus, NewsWatcher and the NCSA packages, especially [[NCSA Mosaic]] and its offspring, [[Netscape Navigator]].{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 46}} Additionally, a number of server products appeared that allowed the Mac to host Internet content. Through this period, Macs had about 2 to 3 times as many clients connected to the Internet as any other platform,{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 51}}{{third-party-inline|date=June 2012}} despite the relatively small overall marketshare.\n\nAs the world quickly moved to IP for both LAN and WAN uses, Apple was faced with maintaining two increasingly outdated code bases on an ever-wider group of machines as well as the introduction of the [[PowerPC]] based machines. This led to the [[Open Transport]] efforts, which re-implemented both MacTCP and AppleTalk on an entirely new code base adapted from the Unix standard [[STREAMS]]. Early versions had problems and did not become stable for some time.{{sfn|Oppenheimer|2004|loc=Slide 54}}  By that point, Apple was deep in their ultimately doomed [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] efforts.\n\n===Legacy and abandonment===\nWith the purchase of [[NeXT]] and subsequent development of [[Mac OS X]], AppleTalk was strictly a legacy system. Support was added to OS X in order to provide support for the large number of existing AppleTalk devices, notably [[laser printer]]s and file shares, but alternate connection solutions common in this era, notably USB for printers, limited their demand. As Apple abandoned many of these product categories, and all new systems were based on IP, AppleTalk became less and less common. AppleTalk support was finally removed from the MacOS in [[Mac OS X v10.6]] in 2009.<ref name=\"snow_leopard_printing\">[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3771 \"Mac OS X v10.6: Mac 101 \u2013 Printing\"]. Retrieved on 2 September 2009.</ref>\n\nHowever, the loss of AppleTalk did not reduce the desire for networking solutions that combined its ease-of-use with IP routing. Apple has led development of many such efforts, from the introduction of the [[AirPort]] router to the development of the [[Zero configuration networking]] system and their implementation of it, [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]].\n\n== Design ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2007}}\nThe AppleTalk design rigorously followed the [[OSI model]] of protocol layering.  Unlike most of the early [[local area network|LAN]] systems, AppleTalk was not built using the archetypal [[Xerox XNS]] system.  The intended target was not Ethernet, and it did not have 48-bit addresses to route. Nevertheless, many portions of the AppleTalk system have direct analogs in XNS.\n\nOne key differentiation for AppleTalk was it contained two protocols aimed at making the system completely self-configuring. The ''AppleTalk address resolution protocol'' (''AARP'') allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own network addresses, and the ''Name Binding Protocol'' (''NBP'') was a dynamic system for mapping network addresses to user-readable names. Although systems similar to AARP existed in other systems, [[Banyan VINES]] for instance, nothing like NBP has existed until recently{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}.\n\nBoth AARP and NBP had defined ways to allow \"controller\" devices to override the default mechanisms. The concept was to allow routers to provide the information or  \"hardwire\" the system to known addresses and names.  On larger networks where AARP could cause problems as new nodes searched for free addresses, the addition of a router could reduce \"chattiness.\"  Together AARP and NBP made AppleTalk an easy-to-use networking system. New machines were added to the network by plugging them and optionally giving them a name.  The NBP lists were examined and displayed by a program known as the ''[[Apple Chooser|Chooser]]'' which would display a list of machines on the local network, divided into classes such as file-servers and printers.\n\n== Addressing ==\nAn AppleTalk address was a 4-byte quantity. This consisted of a two-byte network number, a one-byte node number, and a one-byte socket number. Of these, only the network number required any configuration, being obtained from a router. Each node dynamically chose its own node number, according to a protocol (originally the LocalTalk Link Access Protocol LLAP and later the AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol, AARP){{sfn|Sidhu|Andrews|Oppenheimer|1989}} which handled contention between different nodes accidentally choosing the same number. For socket numbers, a few well-known numbers were reserved for special purposes specific to the AppleTalk protocol itself. Apart from these, all application-level protocols were expected to use dynamically-assigned socket numbers at both the client and server end.\n\nBecause of this dynamism, users could not be expected to access services by specifying their address. Instead, all services had ''names'' which, being chosen by humans, could be expected to be meaningful to users, and also could be sufficiently long to minimize the chance of conflicts.\n\nAs NBP names translated to an address, which included a socket number as well as a node number, a name in AppleTalk mapped directly to a ''service'' being provided by a machine, which was entirely separate from the name of the machine itself. Thus, services could be moved to a different machine and, so long as they kept the same service name, there was no need for users to do anything different in order to continue accessing the service. And the same machine could host any number of instances of services of the same type, without any network connection conflicts.\n\nContrast this with ''A records'' in the [[Domain Name System|DNS]], where a name translates to a machine's address, not including the port number that might be providing a service. Thus, if people are accustomed to using a particular machine name to access a particular service, their access will break when the service is moved to a different machine. This can be mitigated somewhat by insistence on using ''CNAME records'' indicating service rather than actual machine names to refer to the service, but there is no way of guaranteeing that users will follow such a convention. Some newer protocols, such as [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] and [[Active Directory]] use DNS [[SRV record]]s to identify services by name, which is much closer to the AppleTalk model.{{original research inline|date=June 2012}}\n\n== Protocols ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol ===\nAARP resolves AppleTalk addresses to [[link layer]], usually [[MAC address|MAC]], addresses. It is functionally equivalent to [[Address resolution protocol|ARP]].\n\nAARP is a fairly simple system. When powered on, an AppleTalk machine broadcasts an ''AARP probe packet'' asking for a network address, intending to hear back from controllers such as routers. If no address is provided, one is picked at random from the \"base subnet\", 0. It then broadcasts another packet saying \"I am selecting this address\", and then waits to see if anyone else on the network complains. If another machine has that address, it will pick another address, and keep trying until it finds a free one. On a network with many machines it may take several tries before a free address is found, so for performance purposes the successful address is \"written down\" in [[NVRAM]] and used as the default address in the future. This means that in most real-world setups where machines are added a few at a time, only one or two tries are needed before the address effectively become constant.\n\n=== AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol ===\nThis was a comparatively late addition to the AppleTalk protocol suite, done when it became clear that a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]-style reliable connection-oriented transport was needed. Significant differences from TCP were:\n* a connection attempt could be rejected\n* there were no \"half-open\" connections; once one end initiated a tear-down of the connection, the whole connection would be closed (''i.e.'', ADSP is [[duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]], not [[dual simplex]]).\n\n=== Apple Filing Protocol ===\nThe [[Apple Filing Protocol]] (AFP), formerly AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is the protocol for communicating with [[AppleShare]] file servers. Built on top of AppleTalk Session Protocol (for legacy AFP over DDP) or the [[Data Stream Interface]] (for AFP over TCP), it provides services for authenticating users (extensible to different authentication methods including two-way random-number exchange) and for performing operations specific to the Macintosh [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] filesystem. AFP is still in use in macOS, even though most other AppleTalk protocols have been deprecated.\n\n=== AppleTalk Session Protocol ===\nASP was an intermediate protocol, built on top of ATP, which in turn was the foundation of AFP. It provided basic services for requesting responses to arbitrary ''commands'' d performing out-of-band status queries. It also allowed the server to send asynchronous ''attention'' messages to the client.\n\n=== Datagram Delivery Protocol ===\nDDP was the lowest-level data-link-independent transport protocol. It provided a [[datagram]] service with no guarantees of delivery. All application-level protocols, including the infrastructure protocols NBP, RTMP and ZIP, were built on top of DDP. AppleTalk's DDP corresponds closely to the Network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection ([[OSI model|OSI]]) communication model.\n\n=== Name Binding Protocol ===\nName Binding Protocol was a dynamic, distributed system for managing AppleTalk names. When a service started up on a machine, it registered a name for itself as chosen by a human administrator. At this point, NBP provided a system for checking that no other machine had already registered the same name. Later, when a client wanted to access that service, it used NBP to query machines to find that service. NBP provided browseability (\"what are the names of all the services available?\") as well as the ability to find a service with a particular name. Names were human readable, containing spaces, upper and lower case letters, and including support for searching.\n\n===AppleTalk Echo Protocol===\nAEP (AppleTalk Echo Protocol) is a transport layer protocol designed to test the reachability of network nodes. AEP generates packets to be sent to the network node and is identified in the Type field of a packet as an AEP packet. The packet is first passed to the source DDP. After it is identified as an AEP packet, it is forwarded to the node where the packet is examined by the DDP at the destination. After the packet is identified as an AEP packet, the packet is then copied and a field in the packet is altered to create an AEP reply packet, and is then returned to the source node.\n\n=== Printer Access Protocol ===\nPAP was the standard way of communicating with [[PostScript]] printers. It was built on top of ATP. When a PAP connection was opened, each end sent the other an ATP request which basically meant \"send me more data\". The client's response to the server was to send a block of PostScript code, while the server could respond with any diagnostic messages that might be generated as a result, after which another \"send-more-data\" request was sent. This use of ATP provided automatic [[flow control (data)|flow control]]; each end could only send data to the other end if there was an outstanding ATP request to respond to.\n\nPAP also provided for out-of-band status queries, handled by separate ATP transactions. Even while it was busy servicing a print job from one client, a PAP server could continue to respond to status requests from any number of other clients. This allowed other Macintoshes on the LAN that were waiting to print to display status messages indicating that the printer was busy, and what the job was that it was busy with.\n\n=== Routing Table Maintenance Protocol ===\nRTMP was the protocol by which routers kept each other informed about the topology of the network. This was the only part of AppleTalk that required periodic unsolicited broadcasts: every 10 seconds, each router had to send out a list of all the network numbers it knew about and how far away it thought they were.\n\n=== Zone Information Protocol ===\nZIP was the protocol by which AppleTalk network numbers were associated with zone names. A ''zone'' was a subdivision of the network that made sense to humans (for example, \"Accounting Department\"); but while a network number had to be assigned to a topologically-contiguous section of the network, a zone could include several different discontiguous portions of the network.\n\n== Physical implementation ==\n{{multiple image\n   | footer    = Interior of Apple LocalTalk interface box. In 1989, these boxes typically cost US $90 each. The connectors feature automatic [[electrical termination]] of the LocalTalk signal bus; insertion of a LocalTalk bus cable depresses a normally closed [[switch]] behind the connector, disabling termination for that connector.\n   | width1     = 155\n   | image1    = Apple LocalTalk box interior 1.jpg\n   | alt1      = Local cable and interior circuit board, port-side view\n   | width2     = 125\n   | image2    = Apple LocalTalk box interior 2 - auto termination switch.jpg\n   | alt2      = Rear view of auto-termination switch with dust cover removed\n  }}\n[[File:Farlon localtalk.jpg|thumb|Farallon PhoneNET adapter.]]\nThe initial default hardware implementation for AppleTalk was a high-speed serial protocol known as ''[[LocalTalk]]'' that used the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]'s built-in [[RS-422]] ports at 230.4 kbit/s. LocalTalk used a splitter box in the RS-422 port to provide an upstream and downstream cable from a single port. The topology was a [[Bus network|bus]]: cables were daisy-chained from each connected machine to the next, up to the maximum of 32 permitted on any [[LocalTalk]] segment. The system was slow by today's standards, but at the time the additional cost and complexity of networking on PC machines was such that it was common that Macs were the only networked personal computers in an office. Other larger computers, such as UNIX or VAX workstations, would commonly be networked via Ethernet.\n\nOther physical implementations were also available. One common replacement for LocalTalk was ''[[PhoneNet]]'', a 3rd party solution (from a company called Farallon, now called [[Netopia]], acquired by [[Motorola]] in 2007) that also used the RS-422 port and was indistinguishable from LocalTalk as far as Apple's LocalTalk port drivers were concerned, but ran over the two unused wires in standard four-wire phone cabling. PhoneNet was considerably less expensive to install and maintain. Ethernet and [[Token Ring]] was also supported, known as ''EtherTalk'' and ''TokenTalk'' respectively. EtherTalk in particular gradually became the dominant implementation method for AppleTalk as Ethernet became generally popular in the PC industry throughout the 1990s. Besides AppleTalk and [[TCP/IP]], any Ethernet network could also simultaneously carry other protocols such as [[DECnet]] and [[IPX]].\n\n== Networking model ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!OSI Model\n!Corresponding AppleTalk layers\n|-\n|[[Application layer|Application]]\n|[[Apple Filing Protocol]] (AFP)\n|-\n|[[Presentation layer|Presentation]]\n|[[Apple Filing Protocol]] (AFP)\n|-\n|[[Session layer|Session]]\n|Zone Information Protocol ([[Zone Information Protocol|ZIP]])<br>AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP)<br>AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP)\n|-\n|[[Transport layer|Transport]]\n|AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP)<br>[[AppleTalk Echo Protocol]] (AEP)<br>Name Binding Protocol ([[Name Binding Protocol#Name Binding Protocol|NBP]])<br>Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)\n|-\n|[[Network layer|Network]]\n|Datagram Delivery Protocol ([[Datagram Delivery Protocol|DDP]])\n|-\n|[[Data link layer|Data link]]\n|EtherTalk Link Access Protocol (ELAP)<br>LocalTalk Link Access Protocol (LLAP) <br> TokenTalk Link Access Protocol (TLAP) <br>Fiber Distributed Data Interface ([[FDDI]])\n|-\n|[[Physical layer|Physical]]\n|[[LocalTalk]] driver<br>Ethernet driver<br>[[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] driver<br>[[FDDI]] driver\n|}\n\n==Versions==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!AppleTalk version\n![[Apple Filing Protocol]]\n!Corresponds to\n!Notes\n|-\n|56\n|\n|System 7.0\n|\n|-\n|57.0.4\n|\n|System 7.12\n|\n|-\n|58.1.1\n|\n|System 7.1.2\n|\n|-\n|58.1.3\n|\n|System 7.5\n|\n|-\n|60.3\n|\n|Mac OS 7.6.1\n|Open Transport 1.3\n|-\n|60.0a6\n|\n|Mac OS 8.6\n| Open Transport 2.0.3\n|-\n|\n|3.0\n|Mac OS X 10.0.3\n|\n|-\n|\n|2.1, 2.0 and even 1.1\n|[[Mac OS X v10.2]]\n|\n|-\n|\n|2.2, 3.0 and 3.1\n|[[Mac OS X v10.3]]\n|\n|-\n|\n|3.2\n|[[Mac OS X v10.4]]\n|\n|}\n\n==Cross-platform solutions==\nWhen AppleTalk was first introduced, the dominant office computing platform was the PC compatible running MS-DOS.

As well as allowing the construction of a PC-only AppleTalk network, it allowed communication between PCs and Macs with TOPS software installed. (Macs without TOPS installed could use the same network but only to communicate with other Apple machines.) The Mac TOPS software did not match the quality of Apple's own either in ease of use or in robustness and freedom from crashes, but the DOS software was relatively simple to use in DOS terms, and was robust.\n\nThe [[BSD]] and [[Linux]] operating systems support AppleTalk through an open source project called [[Netatalk]], which implements the complete protocol suite and allows them to both act as native file or print servers for Macintosh computers, and print to LocalTalk printers over the network.\n\nThe [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] Server operating systems supported AppleTalk starting with [[Windows NT]] and ending after [[Windows Server 2003]].  Miramar included AppleTalk in its PC MacLAN product which was discontinued by CA in 2007. [[GroupLogic]] continues to bundle its AppleTalk protocol with its [[ExtremeZ-IP]] server software for Macintosh-Windows integration which supports [[Windows 2008 Server]] and [[Windows Vista]] as well prior versions. [http://www.helios.com HELIOS Software GmbH] offers a proprietary implementation of the AppleTalk protocol stack, as part of their HELIOS UB2 server. This is essentially a File and Print Server suite that runs on a whole range of different platforms.\n\nIn addition, Columbia University released the Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) which implemented the protocol suite for various Unix flavors including [[Ultrix]], [[SunOS]], *[[BSD]] and [[IRIX]].

This [[Microsoft]]-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC).\n\nExcept for improved graphics and disk-booting support in the ROM, and the removal of the 2k 6502 assembler/disassembler to make room for the floating point BASIC, the II+ was otherwise identical to the original II. RAM prices fell during 1980\u201381 and all II+ machines came from the factory with a full 48k of memory already installed. The language card in Slot 0 added another 16k, but it had to be [[bank switch]]ed since the remaining CPU address space was occupied by the ROMs and I/O area. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the [[UCSD Pascal]] and [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN 77]] compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] operating system, which had its own disk format and emitted code for a \"virtual machine\" rather than the actual 6502 processor.\n\nA [[TEMPEST]]-approved version of the Apple II Plus was created in 1980 by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] for [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[FORSCOM]], and used as a component in the earliest versions of the Microfix system. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk ([[Laserdisc]]) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as [[order of battle]], airfields, roadways, and bridges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159 |title=The development of small computer geographic analysis systems for military applications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724182533/http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159 |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/raw-attachment/wiki/Presentations/Moving_Maps.pdf|title= Moving Maps: Evolution in GIS|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023152/http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/raw-attachment/wiki/Presentations/Moving_Maps.pdf|archivedate= July 19, 2011|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34_3.pdf|title=U.S. Army Field Manual 34-3, Intelligence Analysis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604064552/http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34_3.pdf|archivedate=June 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Apple II Europlus and J-Plus====\n[[File:Apple II J-Plus.jpg|thumb|Apple II J-Plus]]\nAfter the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include Europe, Australia and the Far East in 1979, with the '''Apple II Europlus''' (Europe, Australia) and the '''Apple II J-Plus''' (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and [[firmware]] changes in order to comply to standards outside of the U.S. The [[power supply]] was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European and Australian model the video output signal was changed from color [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] to monochrome [[Phase Alternating Line|PAL]] \u2013 an extra video card was needed for color PAL graphics, since the simple tricks Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the keyboard layout was changed to allow for [[Katakana]] writing (full [[Kanji]] support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]], for example. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983.\n\n===Apple IIe===\n{{Main|Apple IIe}}\n[[Image:Apple iie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Apple IIe with DuoDisk and Monitor //.]]\n\nThe Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the '''[[Apple IIe]]''', a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64&nbsp;kB of RAM.\n\nThe IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48&nbsp;kB Apple II Plus with a language card. The machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that could accept a 1&nbsp;kB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe. An \"extended 80-column card\" with more memory increased the machine's RAM to 128&nbsp;kB.\n\nAs with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]] operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a [[RAM disk]] upon booting.\n\nThe {{nowrap|1 K}} 80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (80\u00d748 pixels). The extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560\u00d7192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (40\u00d748) and Hi-Res (280\u00d7192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIes from the very first production run could not use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC.\n\nIntroduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, two 5.25-inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe Apple IIe was the most popular machine in the Apple II series. It has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time&mdash;it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, two variations were introduced: the '''Apple IIe Enhanced''' (four replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model [[Apple IIc]]) and the '''Apple IIe Platinum''' (a modernized case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a [[numeric keypad]]). An Enhanced IIe with 128&nbsp;kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988. Enhanced models were distinguished from the standard IIe by having 128k of memory, double hi-resolution graphics, and a [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] CPU.\n\nTwo and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple produced and unsuccessfully marketed a computer called the ''[[Apple III]]'' for business users. Some of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe. Among them was the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III's [[Sophisticated Operating System]] (SOS).\n\n===Apple IIc===\n{{Main|Apple IIc}}\n[[Image:Apple iicb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer.]]\n\nApple released the '''[[Apple IIc]]''' in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern [[portable computer|portables]] it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the [[Snow White design language]], and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color.<ref>\"Kunkel, Paul, AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30</ref> (The other Snow White computers from the Apple II series, the II<small>GS</small> and the IIc Plus, were light gray, called \"Platinum\" by Apple.) The obsolete cassette port was omitted from the IIc.\n\nThe Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128&nbsp;kB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1&nbsp;MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1&nbsp;MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3\u00bd-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.\n\nIIc machines supported the 16-color double hi-resolution graphics mode and from a software standpoint were identical to the IIe.\n\nTwo different monochrome [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12&nbsp;V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.\n\nThe Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apple2online.com/web_documents/apple_iic_technical_notes.pdf|title=Apple II Technical Notes|last=Deatherage|first=Matt|last2=Birse|first2=Cameron|date=November 1988|website=apple2online.com|access-date=2 June 2018}}</ref> which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II<small>GS</small> (accessible via the built-in control panel). The international models used the same mechanism to switch between the localized and the American keyboard layouts, but did not offer Dvorak.\n\n===Apple II<small>GS</small>===\n{{Main|Apple IIGS}}\n[[Image:Apple IIGS.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS, the most powerful Apple II, featuring a true 16-bit CPU, 4096 colors, Ensoniq synthesizer, a Mac-like GUI and a mouse.]]\n[[Image:Apple iigs.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS setup, with keyboard and mouse shown.]]\n\nThe '''[[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]]''', released on September 15, 1986, was radical departure from the existing Apple II line. It featured a true [[16-bit]] microprocessor, the [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]] operating at {{nowrap|2.8&nbsp;MHz}} with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8&nbsp;MB of RAM. It introduced a palette of 4096 colors and new graphics modes with resolutions of 320*200 and 640*400.<ref name=\"making\">Duprau, Jeanne, and Tyson, Molly. \"The Making of the Apple IIGS\", ''A+ Magazine'', November 1986: 57\u201374.</ref>\n\nThe Apple II<small>GS</small> evolved and advanced the platform while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The Apple II<small>GS</small>'s [[Mega II]] chip contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor).

It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a 3\u00bd-inch drive, the power supply was moved inside the case, and the processor was a fast {{nowrap|4&nbsp;MHz}} 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II<small>GS</small>. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a [[megabyte]] of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II<small>GS</small>. Unlike the IIe IIc and II<small>GS</small>, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA.\n\n===Apple IIe Card===\n{{Main|Apple IIe Card}}\n\nAlthough not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the '''[[Apple IIe Card]]''', an expansion card for the [[Macintosh LC|LC]] line of [[Macintosh]] computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II<small>GS</small>), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through [[hardware emulation]] (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be \"borrowed\" by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3.5-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II<small>GS</small> in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II<small>GS</small> that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.\n\n==Advertising, marketing, and packaging==\n[[File:Apple II advertisement Dec 1977 page 1.jpg|thumb|A page from a 1977 ''Byte'' magazine advertisement for the original Apple&nbsp;II]]\n[[Mike Markkula]],<ref name=\"Markkula1997\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|date=September 1, 1997|work=New York Times|first=John|last=Markoff|accessdate=April 25, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301012736/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|archivedate=March 1, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> a retired [[Intel]] marketing manager, provided the early critical funding for Apple Computer.

Agats were not direct clones of Apple II, but rather uniquely designed computers based on 6502 CPU and emulated Apple II architecture. That helped developers to port Apple II software titles to Agat.

Their official brand name was IRIS 8. They were very expensive and hard to obtain and were produced primarily for use in early computerized digital telephone systems and for education. Their use in offices of state companies, R&D labs and in the Yugoslav army was also reported. IRIS 8 machines looked like early IBM PCs, with a separate central unit accompanied by a cooling system and two 5.25-inch disks, monitor, and keyboard. Compatibility with the original Apple II was complete. Elite high schools in Yugoslavia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina were equipped with clusters of 8, 16, or 32 IRIS 8 computers connected in a local network administrated by an IRIS 16 PC clone. The number of IRIS 8s produced is believed to be on the order of 10 or 20 thousand.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAn Australian-produced clone of the Apple II was the [[Medfly computer|Medfly]], named after the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters, and a built-in disk controller.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nUntil 1992 in [[Brazil]], it was illegal to import microcomputers. Because of that, the illegal cloning industry of Apple II-based computers was strong there. In the early 1980s, there were around 20 different clones of Apple II Plus computers in that country, all of them using illegally copied software and hardware (since the Apple II and II Plus used commonly available TTL integrated circuits). Some of the names include Elppa (\"Apple\" spelled backwards), Maxtro, Exato MC4000 (by CCE), AP II (by Unitron), and even an \"Apple II Plus\" (manufactured by a company called Milmar, which was using the name illegally). There were only two clones of the Apple IIe, since it used custom IC chips that could not be copied, and therefore had to be reversed-engineered and developed in the country. These clones were the TK3000 IIe by Microdigital and Exato IIe by CCE. In addition, the Laser IIc was manufactured by Milmar and, despite the name, was a clone of the Apple II Plus, not of the Apple IIc, although it had a design similar to that of the Apple IIc, with an integrated floppy controller and 80-column card, but without an integrated floppy disk drive.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe Ace clones from [[Franklin Computer Corporation]] were the best known Apple II clones and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's response was that a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.]]) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nApple also challenged [[VTech]]'s [[Laser 128]], an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, [[Microsoft]]. Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; VTech was the first cloner to license it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in accelerated versions that ran faster than {{nowrap|1&nbsp;MHz}}. Although it was not fully compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well as on genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as [[Sears]], the Laser 128 cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as [[Commodore Business Machines]] as much as it did Apple's.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nWhile the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3\u00bd-inch drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Bell & Howell]], an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case.

Additionally, it featured a 5-amp power supply which supplied ample power for add-on cards. SEKON avoided shipments being confiscated by U.S. Customs, by shipping their computers without ROMS, leaving it to the dealers to populate the boards upon arrival to their private stores.  Often these machines would boot up with a familiar logo of the Apple II after the dealers removed E-proms of original Apple ROMS and added them in. The reason for such activity was so that users could obtain a fully Apple-compatible clone for usually around US$600, as opposed to US$2500 from Apple.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAlthough not technically a clone, [[Quadram]] produced an add-in [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] card, called the Quadlink, that provided hardware emulation of an Apple II+ for the [[IBM PC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/pipermail/cctech/2005-January/037465.html |title=Quadlink by Quadram \u2013 put an Apple II in you PC |accessdate=2009-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175706/http://www.classiccmp.org/pipermail/cctech/2005-January/037465.html |archivedate=July 25, 2011 }}</ref> The card had its own 6502 CPU and dedicated 80&nbsp;K RAM (64&nbsp;K for applications, plus 16&nbsp;K to hold a reverse-engineered Apple ROM image, loaded at boot-time), and installed \"between\" the PC and its floppy drive(s), color display, and speaker, in a pass-through configuration.

A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the [[Commodore Datasette]] was never produced; Apple recommended using the [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]] RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. The uses of common consumer cassette recorders and a standard video monitor or television set (with a third party R-F modulator) made the total cost of owning an Apple II less expensive and helped contribute to the Apple II's success.\n\nCassette storage may have been inexpensive, but it was also slow and unreliable. The Apple II's lack of a disk drive was \"a glaring weakness\" in what was otherwise intended to be a polished, professional product. Recognizing that the II needed a disk drive to be taken seriously, Apple set out to develop a disk drive and a DOS to run it. Wozniak spent the 1977 Christmas holidays designing a disk controller that reduced the number of chips used by a factor of 10 compared to existing controllers. Still lacking a DOS, and with Wozniak inexperienced in operating system design, Jobs approached Shepardson Microsystems with the project. On April 10, 1978 Apple signed a contract for $13,000 with Sheperdson to develop the DOS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/the-untold-story-behind-apples-13000-operating-system/|title=The untold story behind Apple's $13,000 operating system|author=|date=April 3, 2013|website=cnet.com|accessdate=April 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106070050/https://www.cnet.com/news/the-untold-story-behind-apples-13000-operating-system/|archivedate=November 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nEven after disk drives made the cassette input and output ports obsolete they were still used by enthusiasts as simple one-bit audio input-output ports. Ham radio operators used the cassette input to receive slow scan TV (single frame images). A commercial speech recognition Blackjack program was available, after some user-specific voice training it would recognize simple commands (Hit, stand). Bob Bishop's \"Music Kaleidoscope\" was a simple program which monitored the cassette input port and based on zero-crossings created color patterns on the screen, a predecessor to current audio visualization plug-ins for media players. Music Kaleidoscope was especially popular on projection TV sets in dance halls.\n\n===Disk===\n{{overly detailed|section|date=September 2018}}\n\nApple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available in 1978, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market. The initial price of the Disk II drive and controller was US$595, although a $100 off coupon was available through the Apple newsletter \"Contact\". The controller could handle two drives and a second drive (without controller) retailed for $495.\n\nThe Disk II single-sided floppy drive used 5.25-inch [[floppy disk]]s; double-sided disks could be used, one side at a time, by turning them over and notching a hole for the write protect sensor. The first [[disk operating system]]s for the Apple II were [[Apple DOS|DOS 3.1]] and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75&nbsp;kB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of 13 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140&nbsp;kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable as two PROMs on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks. It was possible for software developers to create a DOS 3.2 disk which would also boot on a system with DOS 3.3 firmware.\n\nLater, double-sided drives, with heads to read both sides of the disk, became available from third-party companies. (Apple only produced double-sided 5.25\" disks for the Lisa 1 computer).\n\nOn a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero \u2013 which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic \"chattering\" sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail \u2013 and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average [[seek time]] to the frequently used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.\n\nMost game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage \"crackers\" from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily.\n\nSome third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160&nbsp;kB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known commercial software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; a two byte modification to DOS to format the extra track was common.\n\nThe Apple Disk II stored 140&nbsp;kB on single-sided, \"single-density\" floppy disks, but it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a single-sided floppy disk to 280&nbsp;kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a \"disk notcher\" or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.\n\nLater, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800&nbsp;kB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400&nbsp;kB had to be split up into multiple \"virtual disk volumes.\"\n\nDOS 3.3 was succeeded by [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS. It added support for subdirectories and volumes up to 32&nbsp;MB in size. ProDOS became the Apple II DOS of choice; [[AppleWorks]] and other newer programs required it.\n\n==Legacy==\n===Industry impact===\nThe Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and on everyday life. The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw. Its price was within the reach of many middle-class families, and a partnership with [[MECC]] helped make the Apple II popular in schools.<ref name=\"lussenhop20110119\">{{cite news|last=Lussenhop |first=Jessica |title=Oregon Trail: How three Minnesotans forged its path |url=http://www.citypages.com/content/printVersion/1740595/ |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |newspaper=City Pages |date=January 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206102726/http://www.citypages.com/content/printVersion/1740595/ |archivedate=February 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> By the end of 1980 Apple had already sold over 100,000 Apple IIs.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sy8vejqbcocC&pg=RA1-PA19&lpg=RA1-PA19&dq=apple+IIe+educational+sales|title=Essentials of Strategic Management By Charles Hill, Gareth Jones|isbn=978-0-547-19432-5|author1=Hill|first1=Charles|last2=Jones|first2=Gareth|date=October 13, 2008}}</ref> Its popularity bootstrapped the [[Personal computer game|computer game]] and [[educational software]] markets and began the boom in the [[word processor]] and [[computer printer]] markets. The first microcomputer program for business was [[VisiCalc]],{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the earliest [[spreadsheet]], and it ran first on the Apple II. Many businesses bought Apple IIs just to run VisiCalc. Its success caused [[IBM]] to create the [[IBM PC]], which many businesses purchased to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions.\n\nThe Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. The first peripheral card was a blank prototyping card intended for electronics enthusiasts who wanted to design their own peripherals for the Apple II.\n\nSpecialty peripherals kept the Apple II in use in industry and education environments for many years after Apple Computer stopped supporting the Apple II.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Well into the 1990s every clean-room (the super-clean facility where spacecraft are prepared for flight) at the Kennedy Space Center used an Apple II to monitor the environment and air quality.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Most planetariums used Apple IIs to control their projectors and other equipment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nEven the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output. The early manuals included instructions for how to build a circuit with only four commonly available components (one transistor and three resistors) and a software routine to drive a common [[Teletype Model 33]] machine. [[Don Lancaster]] used the game I/O to drive a [[LaserWriter]] printer.\n\n===Modern use===\nToday, [[Apple II emulators|emulators]] for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], homebrew enabled [[Nintendo DS]] and other operating systems. Numerous [[disk image]]s of Apple II software are available free over the Internet for use with these emulators. [[AppleWin]] and [[Multi Emulator Super System|MESS]] are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images. The MESS emulator supports recording and playing back of Apple II emulation sessions, as does Home Action Replay Page (a.k.a.

It was intended as the successor to the [[Apple II series]], but was largely considered a failure in the market.\n\nDevelopment work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of \"Sara\", named after Sander's daughter.<ref name = \"sara\">Linzmayer, Owen W. (2004).

However, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. The key features business users wanted in a personal computer were a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard (contrary to the Apple II, which only supported uppercase letters) and 80-column display. In addition, the machine had to pass U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) [[radio frequency interference]] (RFI) qualifications for business equipment. In 1981, [[IBM|International Business Machines]] (IBM) unveiled the [[IBM Personal Computer]] (IBM PC) \u2013 a completely new [[16-bit]] design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the [[PC DOS]]/[[MS-DOS]] platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.<ref name = \"IBMPC\">[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/ibm-pc-5150-origin.html The Origin of the IBM PC]</ref>\n\nAfter numerous stability issues and a recall that included the first 14,000 units from the assembly line, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000\u201375,000 Apple III computers were sold.<ref name = \"intro\" /><ref name=\"apconf\"/> The Apple III Plus brought this up to approximately 120,000.<ref name=\"apconf\"/> Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects.<ref name=\"iwoz\">[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, S.

According to [[Steve Wozniak]], VisiCalc and [[Disk II]] had caused the Apple II's popularity, with 90% of sales going to businesses as opposed to the hobbyists that were its original market. Apple management intended to clearly establish [[market segmentation]] by designing the Apple III to appeal to the business market, leaving the Apple II to home and education users. Management believed that \"once the Apple III was out, the Apple II would stop selling in six months\", Wozniak said.<ref name=\"byte198501\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-01-rescan/1985_01_BYTE_10-01_Through_the_Hourglass#page/n167/mode/2up | title=The Apple Story / Part 2: More History and the Apple III | work=BYTE | date=January 1985 | accessdate=October 26, 2013 |author1=Williams, Gregg |author2=Moore, Rob | page=166 | type=interview}}</ref>\n\nThe Apple III is powered by a 1.8 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[Synertek|Synertek 6502A]] or B<ref>{{cite book|title=Personal Computer Buyers Guide: With Exclusive Product Reference Guide|author=Dennis J.

Third-party vendors also produced memory upgrade kits that allow the Apple III to reach up to 512 KB. Other Apple III built-in features include an 80-column, 24-line display with upper and lowercase characters, a numeric keypad, dual-speed (pressure-sensitive) cursor control keys, 6-bit (DAC) audio, and a built-in 140 KB 5.25\" [[floppy disk]] drive. Graphics modes include 560x192 in black and white, and 280x192 with 16 colors or shades of gray. Unlike the Apple II, the Disk III controller is part of the logic board.\n\nThe Apple III is the first Apple product to allow the user to choose both a screen font and a keyboard layout: either [[QWERTY]] or [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]]. These choices cannot be changed while programs were running, unlike the [[Apple IIc]], which has a keyboard switch directly above the keyboard, allowing the user to switch on the fly.\n\n===Software===\n[[File:Desktop Computer - The Future for Medicine (FDA 095) (8249708093).jpg|thumb|An advertisement for access to health information through the Apple III]]\n\nA major limitation of the Apple II and DOS 3.3 is the way it addresses resources, which makes it highly desirable for [[peripherals]] to be installed in standardized locations (slot 5 and 6 reserved for storage devices, slot 2 reserved for serial communication interfaces, etc.) This forces the user to identify a peripheral by its physical location, such as <code>PR#6, CATALOG, D1</code>, and so on.<ref name=\"beneathdos\">Beneath Apple DOS, Chapter 6 ''Using DOS from Assembly Language''</ref> The Apple III introduced an advanced operating system called [[Apple SOS]], pronounced \"apple sauce\". Its ability to address resources by name instead of a physical location allows the Apple III to be more scalable than the Apple II. Apple SOS also allows the full capacity of a storage device to be used as a single volume, such as the [[Apple ProFile]] hard disk drive. Also, Apple SOS supports a hierarchical file system (HFS). Some of the features and code base of Apple SOS were migrated into the Apple II's [[ProDOS]] and [[GS/OS]] operating systems, as well as [[Apple Lisa|Lisa 7/7]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh system software]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nWith a starting price between $4,340 to $7,800 US, the Apple III was more expensive than many of the [[CP/M]]-based business computers that were available at the time.<ref name=\"avuqmb\" /> Few software titles besides VisiCalc were available for the computer;{{r|moore198209}} according to a presentation at [[KansasFest]] 2012, fewer than 50 Apple III-specific software packages were published, most shipping when the III Plus was released.<ref name=\"kansasfest2012\">{{Cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St08mKEG2EM#t=31m42s |title=Apple III: A Closer Look |date=May 25, 2012 |last=Maginnis |first=Mike |via=YouTube |time=31:42}}</ref> Because Apple did not view the Apple III as suitable for hobbyists, it did not provide much of the technical software information that accompanied the Apple II.<ref name=\"moore198209\" /> Originally intended as a direct replacement to the Apple II series, it was designed to be [[backward compatible]] with Apple II software.

When the decision was made to announce, there were only three Apple IIIs in existence, and they were all [[wire wrap|wire-wrapped]] boards.\n\nThe case of the Apple III had long since been set in concrete, so they had a certain size logic board to fit the circuits on ... They went to three different outside houses and nobody could get a layout that would fit on the board.\n\nThey used the smallest line circuit boards that could be used. They ran about 1,000 of these boards as preproduction units to give to the dealers as demonstration units. They really didn't work ... Apple swapped out the boards.

There were a million problems that you would normally take care of when you do your preproduction and pilot run. Basically, customers were shipped the pilot run.}}\n\n[[Steve Jobs]] insisted on the idea of no fan or air vents, in order to make the computer run quietly. Jobs would later push this same ideology onto almost all Apple models he had control of, from the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh 128K]] to the [[iMac]].<ref>[http://onscreen-scientist.com/?tag=fan-control First Cool, Now Quiet]</ref> To allow the computer to dissipate heat, the base of the Apple III was made of heavy cast aluminum, which supposedly acts as a heat sink. One advantage to the aluminum case was a  reduction in RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), a problem which had plagued the Apple II series throughout its history. Unlike the Apple II series, the power supply was mounted \u2013 without its own shell \u2013 in a compartment separate from the logic board. The decision to use an aluminum shell ultimately led to engineering issues which resulted in the Apple III's reliability problems. The lead time for manufacturing the shells was high, and this had to be done before the motherboard was finalized. Later it was realized that there wasn't enough room on the motherboard for all of the components unless narrow traces were used.\n\n[[File:Apple III+ case.jpg|thumb|Apple III Plus showing the RFI shield over the floppy drive and the cast aluminum case]]\n\nMany Apple IIIs were thought to have failed due to their inability to properly dissipate heat. ''inCider'' stated in 1986 that \"Heat has always been a formidable enemy of the Apple ///\",<ref name=\"obrien198609\" /> and some users reported that their Apple IIIs became so hot that the chips started dislodging from the board, causing the screen to display garbled data or their [[Floppy disks|disk]] to come out of the slot \"melted\".{{cn|date=October 2016}} ''[[BYTE]]'' wrote, \"the integrated circuits tended to [[chip creep|wander out of their sockets]]\".<ref name=\"moore198209\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-09/1982_09_BYTE_07-09_Computers_and_the_Disabled#page/n93/mode/2up | title=The Apple III and Its New Profile | work=BYTE | date=September 1982 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Moore, Robin | page=92}}</ref> Apple advised customers to tilt the front of the Apple III six inches above the desk, and then drop it to reseat the chips.<ref name=\"apconf\"/> Other analyses blame a faulty automatic chip insertion process, not heat.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Really Killed the Apple III|url=http://www.applelogic.org/AIIIDesignBugs.html}}</ref>\n\nCase designer [[Jerry Manock]] denied the design flaw charges, stating that tests proved that the unit adequately dissipated the internal heat. The primary cause, he claimed, was a major logic board design problem. The logic board used \"fineline\" technology that was not fully mature at the time, with narrow, closely spaced traces.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7Br07QKMk Computer History Museum: Apple Industrial Designers Robert Brunner and Jerry Manock]</ref> When chips were \"stuffed\" into the board and [[Wave soldering|wave-soldered]], solder bridges would form between traces that were not supposed to be connected. This caused numerous short circuits, which required hours of costly diagnosis and hand rework to fix. Apple designed a new circuit board, with more layers and normal-width traces. The new logic board was laid out by one designer on a huge drafting board, rather than using the costly [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]-[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] system used for the previous board, and the new design worked.\n\nEarlier Apple III units came with a built-in real time clock. The hardware, however, would fail after prolonged use.<ref name=\"moore198209\" /> Assuming that [[National Semiconductor]] would test all parts before shipping them, Apple did not perform this level of testing. Apple was soldering chips directly to boards, and could not easily change out a bad chip if one was found. Eventually, Apple solved this problem by removing the real-time clock from the Apple III's specification rather than shipping the Apple III with the clock pre-installed, and then sold the peripheral as a level 1 technician add-on.<ref name=\"apconf\">{{cite book|title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company|first=Owen W.|last=Linzmayer|isbn=1-59327-010-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&lpg=PA245&pg=PA41|pages=41\u201343}}</ref>\n\n==BASIC==\nMicrosoft and Apple each developed their own versions of BASIC for the Apple III. '''Apple III Microsoft BASIC''' was designed to run on the [[CP/M]] platform available for the Apple III. '''Apple Business BASIC''' shipped with the Apple III. Donn Denman ported Applesoft BASIC to SOS and reworked it to take advantage of the extended memory of the Apple III.\n\nBoth languages introduced a number of new or improved features over [[Applesoft BASIC]]. Both languages replace Applesoft's single-precision floating-point variables using 5-byte storage with the somewhat-reduced-pecision 4-byte variables, while also adding a larger numerical format. Apple III Microsoft BASIC provides double-precision floating-point variables, taking 8 bytes of storage,<ref>Apple III Microsoft BASIC Reference Manual, Microsoft Corporation, 1982</ref> while Apple Business BASIC offers an extra-long integer type, also taking 8 bytes for storage.<ref>Apple Business BASIC Reference Manual, Apple Computer, Inc., 1981</ref> Both languages also retain 2-byte integers, and maximum 255-character strings.\n\nOther new features common to both languages include:\n*Incorporation of disk-file commands within the language.\n*Operators for MOD and for integer-division.\n*An optional ELSE clause in IF...THEN statements.\n*HEX$() function for hexadecimal-format output.\n*INSTR function for finding a substring within a string.\n*PRINT USING statement to control format of output. Apple Business BASIC had an option in addition to directly specifying the format with a string expression, of giving the line number where an IMAGE statement gave the formatting expression, similar to a FORMAT statement in [[Fortran|FORTRAN]].\n\nSome features work differently in each language:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"230px\" | Apple III Microsoft BASIC\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"265px\" | Apple Business BASIC\n|-\n| integer division operator\n| \\ (backslash)\n| DIV\n|-\n| reading the keyboard without waiting\n| INKEY$ function returns a one-character string representing the last key pressed, or the null string if no new key pressed since last reading\n| KBD read-only \"reserved variable\" returns the ASCII code of the last key pressed; the manual fails to document what is returned if no new key pressed since last reading\n|-\n| reassigning a portion of a string variable\n| MID$() assignment statement || SUB$() assignment statement\n|-\n| determining position of text output\n| POS() function to read horizontal screen position, and LPOS() function to read horizontal position on printer\n| HPOS and VPOS assignable \"reserved variables\" to read or set the horizontal or vertical position for text screen output\n|-\n| accepting hexadecimal-format values\n| \"&H\"-formatted expressions\n| TEN() function to give numerical value from string representing hexadecimal\n|-\n| result of ASC(\"\")\n(null string operand)\n| causes an error\n| returns the value \u22121\n|}\n\n===Microsoft BASIC additional features===\n*INPUT$() function to replace Applesoft's GET command.\n*LINE INPUT statement to input an entire line of text, regardless of punctuation, into a single string variable.\n*LPRINT and LPRINT USING statements to automatically direct output to paper.\n*LSET and RSET statements to left- or right-justify a string expression within a given string variable's character length.\n*OCT$() function for output, and \"&\"- or \"&O\"-formatted expressions, for manipulating octal notation.\n*SPACE$() function for generating blank spaces outside of a PRINT statement, and STRING$() function to do likewise with any character.\n*WHILE...WEND statements, for loop structures built on general Boolean conditions without an index variable.\n*Bitwise Boolean (16-bit) operations (AND, OR, NOT), with additional operators XOR, EQV, IMP.\n*Line number specification in the RESTORE command.\n*RESUME options of NEXT (to skip to the statement after that which caused the error) or a specified line number (which replaces the idea of exiting error-handling by GOTO-line, thus avoiding Applesoft II's stack error problem).\n*Multiple parameters in user-defined (DEF FN) functions.\n*A return to the old Applesoft One concept of having multiple USR() functions at different addresses, by establishing ten different USR functions, numbered USR0 to USR9, with separate DEF USRx statements to define the address of each. The argument passed to a USRx function can be of any specific type, including string. The returned value can also be of any type, by default the same type as the argument passed.\n\nThere is no support for graphics provided within the language, nor for reading analog controls or buttons; nor is there a means of defining the active window of the text screen.\n\n===Business BASIC additional features===\nApple Business BASIC eliminates all references to absolute memory addresses. Thus, the POKE command and PEEK() function were not included in the language, and new features replaced the CALL statement and USR() function. Functionality of certain features in Applesoft that had been achieved with various PEEK and POKE locations is now provided by:\n* BUTTON() function to read game-controller buttons\n* WINDOW statement to define the active window of the text screen by its coordinates\n* KBD, HPOS, and VPOS system variables\n\nExternal binary subroutines and functions are loaded into memory by a single INVOKE disk-command that loads separately-assembled code modules. A PERFORM statement is then used to call an INVOKEd procedure by name, with an argument-list. INVOKEd functions would be referenced in expressions by EXFN. (floating-point) or EXFN%. (integer), with the function name appended, plus the argument-list for the function.\n\nGraphics are supported with an INVOKEd module, with features including displaying text within graphics in various fonts, within four different graphics modes available on the Apple III.\n\n==Reception==\nThe Apple III's technical problems made marketing the computer difficult. Ed Smith, who after the [[APF Imagination Machine]] became a distributor's representative, described the computer as \"a complete disaster\". He recalled that he \"was responsible for going to every dealership, setting up the Apple III in their showroom, and then explaining to them the functions of the Apple III, which in many cases didn\u2019t really work\".<ref name=\"edwards20170222\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/1230/ed-smith-interview |title=VC&G Anthology Interview: Ed Smith, Black Video Game and Computer Pioneer |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=February 22, 2017 |website=Vintage Computing and Games}}</ref> Pohlman stated that Apple was only selling 500 units a month by late 1981, mostly as replacements.

However, later research showed if the AVL tree is implemented as a rank balanced tree with delta ranks allowed of 1 or 2 \u2013 with meaning \"when going upward there is an additional increment in height of one or two\", this can be done with one bit.\n\nThe height <math>h</math> of an AVL tree with <math>n</math> nodes lies in the interval:<ref>{{cite book|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|title=Sorting and searching|year=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0-201-89685-0|pages=460|edition=2. ed., 6. printing, newly updated and rev.}}</ref>\n:<math>\\log_2(n+1) \\leq h < c \\log_2(n+2) + b</math> \nwith the [[golden ratio]] {{math|&phi; :&#61; (1+}}<span class=\"nowrap\">&radic;<span style=\"border-top:1px solid; padding:0 0.1em;\">{{math|5}}</span>{{math|) &frasl;<sub>2</sub> &asymp; 1.618}},  {{math|''c'' :&#61; <sup>1</sup>&frasl; log<sub>2</sub> &phi; &asymp; 1.44}}</span>, &nbsp;and&nbsp; {{math|''b'' :&#61; <sup>''c''</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> log<sub>2</sub> 5 \u2013 2 &asymp; \u20130.328}}.\nThis is because an AVL tree of height {{math|''h''}} contains at least {{math|''F''<sub>''h''+2</sub> \u2013 1}} nodes where {{math|&#123;''F''<sub>''h''</sub>&#125;}} is the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] with the seed values {{math|''F''<sub>''1''</sub> &#61; 1}}, {{math|''F''<sub>''2''</sub> &#61; 1}}.\n\n==Operations==\nRead-only operations of an AVL tree involve carrying out the same actions as would be carried out on an unbalanced [[binary search tree]], but modifications have to observe and restore the height balance of the subtrees.\n\n===Searching===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nSearching for a specific key in an AVL tree can be done the same way as that of a normal unbalanced [[Binary search tree#Searching|binary search tree]]. In order for search to work effectively it has to employ a comparison function which establishes a [[total order]] (or at least a [[Weak ordering#Total preorders|total preorder]]) on the set of keys. The number of comparisons required for successful search is limited by the height {{math|''h''}} and for unsuccessful search is very close to {{math|''h''}}, so both are in {{math|O(log ''n'')}}.\n\n===Traversal===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nOnce a node has been found in an AVL tree, the ''next'' or ''previous'' node can be accessed in [[amortized complexity|amortized]] constant time. Some instances of exploring these \"nearby\" nodes require traversing up to {{math|''h'' &prop; log(''n'')}} links (particularly when navigating from the rightmost leaf of the root\u2019s left subtree to the root or from the root to the leftmost leaf of the root\u2019s right subtree; in the AVL tree of figure 1, moving from node P to the ''next but one'' node Q takes 3 steps). However, exploring all {{math|''n''}} nodes of the tree in this manner would visit each link exactly twice: one downward visit to enter the subtree rooted by that node, another visit upward to leave that node\u2019s subtree after having explored it. And since there are {{math|''n''\u22121}} links in any tree, the amortized cost is {{math|2\u00d7(''n''\u22121)/''n''}}, or approximately 2.\n\n===Insert===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Expand section|date=November 2016|small=no}}\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\n}}\nWhen inserting an element into an AVL tree, you initially follow the same process as inserting into a Binary Search Tree. More explicitly: In case a preceding search has not been successful the search routine returns the tree itself with indication EMPTY and the new node is inserted as root. Or, if the tree has not been empty the search routine returns a node and a direction (left or right) where the returned node does not have a child. Then the node to be inserted is made child of the returned node at the returned direction.\n\nAfter this insertion it is necessary to check each of the node\u2019s ancestors for consistency with the invariants of AVL trees: this is called \"retracing\". This is achieved by considering the [[#Balance factor|balance factor]] of each node.<ref name=\"Sorting and searching\">{{cite book|last1=Knuth|first1=Donald E.|title=Sorting and searching|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0201896850|pages=458\u2013481|edition=2. ed., 6. printing, newly updated and rev.}}</ref><ref name=\"Free Software Foundation, Inc\">{{cite book|last1=Pfaff|first1=Ben|title=An Introduction to Binary Search Trees and Balanced Trees|date=2004|publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.|pages=107\u2013138}}</ref>\n\nSince with a single insertion the height of an AVL subtree cannot increase by more than one, the temporary balance factor of a node after an insertion will be in the range {{nowrap|[\u20132,+2].}} For each node checked, if the temporary balance factor remains in the range from \u20131 to +1 then only an update of the balance factor and no rotation is necessary. However, if the temporary balance factor becomes less than \u20131 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is AVL unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

If the above procedure is applied to nodes along this path, starting from the leaf, then every node in the tree will again have a balance factor of \u22121, 0, or 1.\n\nThe retracing can stop if the balance factor becomes 0 implying that the height of that subtree remains unchanged.\n\nIf the balance factor becomes \u00b11 then the height of the subtree increases by one and the retracing needs to continue.\n\nIf the balance factor temporarily becomes \u00b12, this has to be repaired by an appropriate rotation after which the subtree has the same height as before (and its root the balance factor 0).\n\nThe time required is {{math|O(log ''n'')}} for lookup, plus a maximum of {{math|O(log ''n'')}} retracing levels ({{math|O(1)}} on average) on the way back to the root, so the operation can be completed in {{math|O(log ''n'')}} time.\n\n===Delete===\nThe preliminary steps for deleting a node are described in section [[Binary search tree#Deletion]].\nThere, the effective deletion of the subject node or the replacement node decreases the height of the corresponding child tree either from 1 to 0 or from 2 to 1, if that node had a child.\n\nStarting at this subtree, it is necessary to check each of the ancestors for consistency with the invariants of AVL trees. This is called \"retracing\".\n\nSince with a single deletion the height of an AVL subtree cannot decrease by more than one, the temporary balance factor of a node will be in the range from \u22122 to +2.\nIf the balance factor remains in the range from \u22121 to +1 it can be adjusted in accord with the AVL rules. If it becomes \u00b12 then the subtree is unbalanced and needs to be rotated. The various cases of rotations are described in section [[#Rebalancing|Rebalancing]].\n\n;Invariant of the retracing loop for a deletion\nThe height of the subtree rooted by N has decreased by 1.

It depends on the balance factor of the sibling Z (the higher child tree) whether the height of the subtree decreases by one or does not change (the latter, if Z has the balance factor 0).\n\nThe time required is {{math|O(log ''n'')}} for lookup, plus a maximum of {{math|O(log ''n'')}} retracing levels ({{math|O(1)}} on average) on the way back to the root, so the operation can be completed in {{math|O(log ''n'')}} time.\n\n===Set operations and bulk operations===\nIn addition to the single-element insert, delete and lookup operations, several set operations have been defined on AVL trees: [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[set difference]]. Then fast ''bulk'' operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations, ''Split'' and ''Join''. With the new operations, the implementation of AVL trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable.<ref name=\"join-based\">{{citation\n | last1 = Blelloch | first1 = Guy E.\n | last2 = Ferizovic | first2 = Daniel\n | last3 = Sun | first3 = Yihan\n | chapter = Just join for parallel ordered sets\n | doi = 10.1145/2935764.2935768\n | isbn = 978-1-4503-4210-0\n | pages = 253\u2013264\n | publisher = ACM\n | title = Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures\n | year = 2016| url = https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02120}}.</ref>\n\n*''Join'': The function ''Join'' is on two AVL trees {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} and a key {{mvar|k}} will return a tree containing all elements in {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} as well as {{mvar|k}}. It requires {{mvar|k}} to be greater than all keys in {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and smaller than all keys in {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. If the two trees differ by height at most one, ''Join'' simply create a new node with left subtree {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}, root {{mvar|k}} and right subtree {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. Otherwise, suppose that {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} is higher than {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} for more than one (the other case is symmetric). ''Join'' follows the right spine of {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} until a node {{mvar|c}} which is balanced with {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. At this point a new node with left child {{mvar|c}}, root {{mvar| k}} and right child {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} is created to replace c. The new node satisfies the AVL invariant, and its height is one greater than {{mvar|c}}. The increase in height can increase the height of its ancestors, possibly invalidating the AVL invariant of those nodes. This can be fixed either with a double rotation if invalid at the parent or a single left rotation if invalid higher in the tree, in both cases restoring the height for any further ancestor nodes. ''Join'' will therefore require at most two rotations. The cost of this function is the difference of the heights between the two input trees.\n*''Split'': To split an AVL tree into two smaller trees, those smaller than key ''x'', and those larger than key ''x'', first draw a path from the root by inserting ''x'' into the AVL. After this insertion, all values less than ''x'' will be found  on the left of the path, and all values greater than ''x'' will be found on the right. By applying ''Join'', all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is asymmetric. The cost of ''Split'' is <math>O(\\log n)</math>, order of the height of the tree.\n\n\nThe join algorithm is as follows:\n\n '''function''' joinRightAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     (l,k',c)=expose(T<sub>L</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(c)<h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1)\n        T'=Node(c,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n        if (h(T')<=h(l)+1) then '''return''' Node(l,k',T')\n        else '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l,k'rotateRight(T')))\n     '''else''' \n         T'=joinRightAVL(c,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n         T''=Node(l,k',T')\n         '''if''' (h(T<sub>L</sub>)>h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1) '''return''' T''\n         '''else''' '''return''' rotateLeft(T'')\n '''function''' joinLeftAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n   /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */\n '''function''' join(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(T<sub>L</sub>)>h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1) '''return''' joinRightAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(T<sub>R</sub>)>h(T<sub>L</sub>)+1) '''return''' joinLeftAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''return''' Node(T<sub>L</sub>,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n\nHere <math>h(v)</math> of a node <math>v</math> the height of <math>v</math>. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node <math>v</math>'s left child <math>l</math>, the key of the node <math>k</math>, and the right child <math>r</math>.

The following recursive function computes this union:\n\n '''function''' union(t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>):\n     '''if''' t<sub>1</sub> = nil:\n         '''return''' t<sub>2</sub>\n     '''if''' t<sub>2</sub> = nil:\n         '''return''' t<sub>1</sub>\n     t<sub><</sub>, t<sub>></sub> \u2190 split t<sub>2</sub> on t<sub>1</sub>.root\n     '''return''' join(t<sub>1</sub>.root,union(left(t<sub>1</sub>), t<sub><</sub>),union(right(t<sub>1</sub>), t<sub>></sub>))\n\nHere, ''Split'' is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less its input key, one holding the greater keys. (The algorithm is [[persistent data structure|non-destructive]], but an in-place destructive version exists as well.)\n\nThe algorithm for intersection or difference is similar, but requires the ''Join2'' helper routine that is the same as ''Join'' but without the middle key. Based on the new functions for union, intersection or difference, either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the AVL tree. Since ''Split'' calls ''Join'' but does not deal with the balancing criteria of AVL trees directly, such an implementation is usually called the [[Join-based tree algorithms|\"join-based\" implementation]].\n\nThe complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is <math>O\\left(m \\log \\left({n\\over m}+1\\right)\\right)</math> for AVLs of sizes <math>m</math> and <math>n(\\ge m)</math>. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed [[parallel programming|in parallel]] with a [[Analysis of parallel algorithms|parallel depth]] <math>O(\\log m\\log n)</math>.<ref name=\"join-based\"/> When <math>m=1</math>, the join-based implementation has the same computational DAG as single-element insertion and deletion.\n\n==Rebalancing==\nIf during a modifying operation (e.g. insert, delete) a (temporary) height difference of more than one arises between two child subtrees, the parent subtree has to be \"rebalanced\". The given repair tools  are the so-called [[tree rotation]]s, because they move the keys only \"vertically\", so that the (\"horizontal\") in-order sequence of the keys is fully preserved (which is essential for a binary-search tree).<ref name=\"Sorting and searching\"/><ref name=\"Free Software Foundation, Inc\"/>\n\nLet X be the node that has a (temporary) balance factor of \u22122 or +2. Its left or right subtree was modified. Let Z be the higher child. Note that Z is in AVL shape by [[Mathematical induction|induction hypothesis]].\n\nIn case of insertion this insertion has happened to one of Z's children in a way that Z's height has increased.\nIn case of deletion this deletion has happened to the sibling t<sub>1</sub> of Z in a way so that t<sub>1</sub>'s height being already lower has decreased. (In that case Z's balance factor may be 0.)\n\nThere are four situations that might arise. We will describe them as '''Dir1 Dir2''', where '''Dir1''' comes from the set { ''left'', ''right'' } and '''Dir2''' as a balance factor comes from the set { ''left-heavy'' = \u22121, ''balanced'' = 0, ''right-heavy'' = +1 }.<ref>Thereby, rotations with case ''Balanced'' do not occur with insertions.</ref>\n\nSituation Dir1 Dir2 denotes:\n:'''Z is a Dir1 child of its parent and'''\n:: '''Z is Dir2-heavy if Dir2 != Dir1 '''\n:: '''Z is not (\u2212Dir2)-heavy if Dir2 == Dir1 '''\ni.e.\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"width:1em\" | || Right Right || => Z is a ''right'' child of its parent X and || Z is not ''left-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) \u2265 0) || (see figure 4)\n|-\n| || Left Left || => Z is a ''left'' child of its parent X and || Z is not ''right-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) \u2264 0)\n|-\n| || Right Left || => Z is a ''right'' child of its parent X and || Z is ''left-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) = \u22121) || (see figure 5)\n|-\n| || Left Right || => Z is a ''left'' child of its parent X and || Z is ''right-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) = +1)\n|}\n\nThe balance violation of case Dir1 == Dir2 is repaired by a simple rotation rotate_(\u2212Dir1) (<tt>rotate_Left</tt> in figure 4 resp. its mirror <tt>rotate_Right</tt>).\n\nThe case Dir1 != Dir2 is repaired by a double rotation rotate_(\u2212Dir2)(\u2212Dir1) == rotate_Dir1Dir2 (<tt>rotate_RightLeft</tt> in figure 5 resp. its mirror <tt>rotate_LeftRight</tt>).\n\nThe cost of a rotation, both simple and double, is constant.\n\n===Simple rotation===\nFigure 4 shows a Right Right situation. In its upper half, node X has two child trees with a balance factor of <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">+2</span>. Moreover, the inner child t<sub>23</sub> of Z (i.e., left child when Z is right child resp. right child when Z is left child) is not higher than its sibling t<sub>4</sub>. This can happen by a height increase of subtree t<sub>4</sub> or by a height decrease of subtree t<sub>1</sub>. In the latter case, also the pale situation where t<sub>23</sub> has the same height as t<sub>4</sub> may occur.\n\nThe result of the left rotation is shown in the lower half of the figure. Three links (thick edges in figure 4) and two balance factors are to be updated.\n\nAs the figure shows, before an insertion, the leaf layer was at level h+1, temporarily at level h+2 and after the rotation again at level h+1. In case of a deletion, the leaf layer was at level h+2, where it is again, when t<sub>23</sub> and t<sub>4</sub> were of same height. Otherwise the leaf layer reaches level h+1, so that the height of the rotated tree decreases.\n\n[[File:AVL-simple-left_K.svg|thumb|right|194px|Fig. 4: Simple rotation<br />''rotate_Left''(''X'',''Z'')]]\n;Code snippet of a simple left rotation\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | Input: || X = root of subtree to be rotated left\n|-\n| || Z = right child of X, Z is right-heavy\n|-\n| || &nbsp; &nbsp; with height == {{math|Height(LeftSubtree(}}X{{math|))+2}}\n|-\n|Result: || new root of rebalanced subtree\n|}\n<source lang=\"c\" style=\"overflow:hidden\" line=\"1\">\nnode *rotate_Left(node *X, node *Z) {\n    // Z is by 2 higher than its sibling\n    t23 = left_child(Z); // Inner child of Z\n    right_child(X) = t23;\n    if (t23 != null)\n        parent(t23) = X;\n    left_child(Z) = X;\n    parent(X) = Z;\n    // 1st case, BalanceFactor(Z) == 0, only happens with deletion, not insertion:\n    if (BalanceFactor(Z) == 0) { // t23 has been of same height as t4\n        BalanceFactor(X) = +1;   // t23 now higher\n        BalanceFactor(Z) = \u20131;   // t4 now lower than X\n    } else { // 2nd case happens with insertion or deletion:\n        BalanceFactor(X) = 0;\n        BalanceFactor(Z) = 0;\n    }\n    return Z; // return new root of rotated subtree\n}\n</source>\n\n===Double rotation===\nFigure 5 shows a Right Left situation. In its upper third, node X has two child trees with a balance factor of <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">+2</span>. But unlike figure 4, the inner child Y of Z is higher than its sibling t<sub>4</sub>. This can happen by the insertion of Y itself or a height increase of one of its subtrees t<sub>2</sub> or t<sub>3</sub> (with the consequence that they are of different height) or by a height decrease of subtree t<sub>1</sub>. In the latter case, it may also occur that t<sub>2</sub> and t<sub>3</sub> are of same height.\n\nThe result of the first, the right, rotation is shown in the middle third of the figure. (With respect to the balance factors, this rotation is not of the same kind as the other AVL single rotations, because the height difference between Y and t<sub>4</sub> is only 1.)

In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of [[horoscope]]s purporting to explain aspects of a person's [[personality]] and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects at the time of their birth. The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.<ref name=\"Cosmic\" />{{rp|83}}\n\nAstrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium [[BCE]], with roots in [[Calendrical calculation|calendrical]] systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.<ref name=\"Koch-Westenholz 1995 Foreword, 11\"/> A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of [[Mesopotamia]] (1950\u20131651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046\u2013256 BCE). [[Hellenistic astrology]] after 332 BCE mixed [[Babylonian astrology]] with Egyptian [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] in [[Alexandria]], creating [[horoscopic astrology]]. [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] conquest of [[Asia]] allowed astrology to spread to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In Rome, astrology was associated with '[[Chaldea]]n wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]]. Major astronomers including [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo]] practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and of playwrights such as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nThroughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition.

Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain [[transcendental element]]s, are called '''transcendental'''.\n\nFor example, the field extension '''R'''/'''Q''', that is the field of [[real number]]s as an extension of the field of [[rational number]]s, is transcendental, while the field extensions '''C'''/'''R''' and '''Q'''({{radic|2}})/'''Q''' are algebraic, where '''C''' is the field of [[complex number]]s.\n\nAll transcendental extensions are of [[degree of a field extension|infinite degree]]. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.<ref>See also Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 3.</ref> The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all [[algebraic number]]s is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.\n\nIf ''a'' is algebraic over ''K'', then ''K''[''a''], the set of all polynomials in ''a'' with coefficients in ''K'', is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of ''K'' which has finite degree over ''K''. The converse is true as well, if ''K''[''a''] is a field, then ''a'' is algebraic over ''K''. In the special case where ''K'' = '''Q''' is the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]], '''Q'''[''a''] is an example of an [[algebraic number field]].\n\nA field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. An example is the field of [[complex number]]s. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its [[algebraic closure]]), but proving this in general requires some form of the [[axiom of choice]].\n\nAn extension ''L''/''K'' is algebraic [[if and only if]] every sub ''K''-algebra of ''L'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\n==Properties==\nThe class of algebraic extensions forms a [[distinguished class of field extensions]], that is, the following three properties hold:<ref>Lang (2002) p.228</ref>\n# If ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''F'' and ''F'' is an algebraic extension of ''K'' then ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''K''.\n# If ''E'' and ''F'' are algebraic extensions of ''K'' in a common overfield ''C'', then the [[compositum]] ''EF'' is an algebraic extension of ''K''.\n# If ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''F'' and ''E''>''K''>''F'' then ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''K''.\n\nThese finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction: \n\n{{ordered list|start=4\n| The union of any chain of algebraic extensions over a base field is itself an algebraic extension over the same base field. \n}} \n\nThis fact, together with [[Zorn's lemma]] (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of [[algebraic closure]]s.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Substructure (mathematics)}}\n[[Model theory]] generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of ''M'' into ''N'' is called an '''algebraic extension''' if for every ''x'' in ''N'' there is a formula ''p'' with parameters in ''M'', such that ''p''(''x'') is true and the set\n\n:<math>\\left\\{y\\in N\\Big|p(y)\\right\\}</math>\n\nis finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The [[Galois group]] of ''N'' over ''M'' can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Integral element]]\n* [[L\u00fcroth's theorem]]\n* [[Galois extension]]\n* [[Separable extension]]\n* [[Normal extension]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first1=Michiel|last1=Hazewinkel|authorlink1=Michiel Hazewinkel|first2= Nadiya|last2= Gubareni|first3= Nadezhda Mikha\u012dlovna |last3= Gubareni| first4=Vladimir V.|last4= Kirichenko|title= Algebras, rings and modules|volume=1|year=2004|publisher= Springer|isbn= 1-4020-2690-0}}\n* {{Lang Algebra|edition=3|chapter=V.1:Algebraic Extensions|pages=223ff}}\n* {{citation | last=McCarthy | first=Paul J. | title=Algebraic extensions of fields | zbl=0768.12001 | location=New York | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1991|origyear=corrected reprint of 2nd edition, 1976|isbn=0-486-66651-4 }}\n* {{citation|first=Steven|last=Roman|title=Field Theory|series=GTM 158|year=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9780387944081}}\n* {{citation|first=Joseph J.|last=Rotman|title=Advanced Modern Algebra|year=2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130878687}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Algebraic Extension}}\n[[Category:Field extensions]]", "sha1": "hla26dtubm2pwcvikcc56esp73gvou6"}}, {"title": "Ani DiFranco", "ns": "0", "id": "2126", "revision": {"id": "865577148", "parentid": "865576982", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T19:41:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Miltoncat", "id": "7886936"}, "comment": "/* Personal life */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name = Ani DiFranco\n| image = Ani Difranco Ancienne Belgique.jpg\n| caption = Ani DiFranco performing at the [[Ancienne Belgique]] in 2007\n| image_size = \n| background = solo_singer\n| birth_name = Angela Maria DiFranco<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/ani-difranco-20874409 |title=Ani DiFranco Biography \u2013 Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date=September 23, 1970 |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref>\n| alias = \n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1970|09|23}}\n| birth_place = [[Buffalo, New York]], United States\n| origin = \n| instrument = {{flatlist|\n* Guitar\n* bass\n* [[tenor guitar]]\n* vocals\n* percussion\n* piano\n|}}\n| genre = {{flatlist|\n* [[Folk rock]]\n* [[alternative rock]]\n* [[punk rock]]\n* [[indie folk]]<ref>http://www.capitalgazette.com/entertainment/ph-ac-cn-ani-difranco-0618-20160621-story.html</ref>\n|}}\n| occupation = {{flatlist|\n* Musician\n* singer-songwriter\n* poet\n|}}\n| years_active = 1989\u2013present\n| label = [[Righteous Babe Records|Righteous Babe]]\n| associated_acts = \n| website = [http://www.anidifranco.com/ anidifranco.com]\n}}\n\n'''Angela Maria \"Ani\" DiFranco''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|n|i\u02d0}};

There, she took poetry classes at [[The New School]], where she met poet [[Sekou Sundiata]], who was to become a friend and mentor. She toured steadily for the next 15 years, pausing only to record albums. Appearances at Canadian folk festivals and increasingly larger venues in the U.S. reflected her increasing popularity on the North American folk and roots scene. Throughout the early and mid-1990s DiFranco toured solo and also as a duo with Canadian drummer [[Andy Stochansky]].\n\nIn September 1995, DiFranco participated in a concert at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland Ohio, inaugurating the opening of the [[Woody Guthrie]] Archives in New York City. She later released a CD on Righteous Babe of the concert entitled ''Til We Outnumber Em'' featuring artists such as DiFranco, [[Billy Bragg]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Dave Pirner]], [[Tim Robbins]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] with 100% of proceeds going to the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum educational department.<ref>Robicheau, Paul.

In 1997 she appeared on Canadian songwriter [[Bruce Cockburn]]'s ''Charity of Night'' album. In 1998 she produced fellow folksinger [[Dan Bern]]'s album ''[[Fifty Eggs]]''.\n\nShe developed a deep association with folksinger and social activist [[Utah Phillips]] throughout the mid-1990s, sharing her stage and her audience with the older musician until his death in 2008 and resulting in two collaborative albums: ''[[The Past Didn't Go Anywhere]]'' (1996) and ''[[Fellow Workers]]'' (1999, with liner notes by [[Howard Zinn]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Zinn|title=Fellow Workers Liner Notes|url=http://zinnedproject.org/materials/fellow-workers-liner-notes-by-howard-zinn/|publisher=Zinn Education Project|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}</ref> ''The Past'' is built around Phillips's storytelling, an important part of his art that had not previously been documented on recordings; on the album, DiFranco provides musical settings for his speaking voice.<ref name=\":0\" /> The followup, ''Fellow Workers'', was recorded live in [[Daniel Lanois]]'s Kingsway Studio in New Orleans and features Phillips fronting DiFranco's touring band for a collection of songs and stories.\n\n[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] recorded two songs with DiFranco in 1999, \"Providence\" on her ''To the Teeth'' album, and \"Eye Love U, But Eye Don't Trust U Anymore\" on Prince's ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://princetext.tripod.com/i_startrib99.html |title=Prince in Print |publisher=Princetext.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> Funk and soul jazz musician [[Maceo Parker]] and rapper Corey Parker have both appeared on DiFranco's albums<ref>{{cite web|title=To The Teeth, album|url=http://www.righteousbabe.com/products/to-the-teeth#.UfvOZ6xH5IA|publisher=Righteous Babe Web Site|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref> and featured appearances by her on theirs.

In 2006 she produced [[Hamell on Trial]]'s album ''Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs''. In 2008 she appeared on [[Todd Sickafoose]]'s album ''Tiny Resisters''. In 2010 she co-produced a track with [[Margaret Cho]] called \"Captain Cameltoe\" for the comedian's ''Cho Dependant'' album. In 2011 she appeared on [[Rob Wasserman]]'s album ''Note of Hope'', an exploration of the writings of [[Woody Guthrie]] with musical accompaniment, though the track in which she appeared, \"Voice\", was actually recorded 13 years earlier. Also in 2011 she duetted with [[Greg Dulli]] on the [[Twilight Singers]] record ''Dynamite Steps''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ani DiFranco credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ani-difranco-mn0000046794/credits|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOther artists have covered and sampled DiFranco's work throughout the years. Her spoken word poem \"Self Evident\" was covered by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] founder [[Chuck D]]'s group called Impossebulls. [[Alana Davis]] had some commercial success with DiFranco's song \"[[32 Flavors]]\".\n\nSamples from the track \"Coming Up\" were used by [[DJ Spooky]] in his album ''Live Without Dead Time'', produced for [[AdBusters]] Magazine in 2003.\n\nIn 2010, DiFranco played [[Persephone]] on [[Ana\u00efs Mitchell]]'s album [[Hadestown]].\n\n===Lyrical content===\nAlthough much of DiFranco's material is autobiographical, it is often also strongly political. Many of her songs are concerned with contemporary social issues such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[sexual abuse]], [[homophobia]], [[reproductive rights]], poverty, and war. In 2008, she donated a song to [[Aid Still Required]]'s CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]].\nThe combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the left wing, some of whom set up fan pages on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact and word of mouth rather than [[mainstream media]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Label independence===\nAni cites her anti-corporate ethos for the main reason she decided to start her own label.

Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes.

In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with [[Koch International]] for DiFranco's release of ''Not a Pretty Girl''. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.\n\nDiFranco has occasionally joined with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies.

In 1999 she created her own not-for-profit organization; as the Buffalo News has reported,\"Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=HEAREY|first=OWEN|title='Righteous Babe' announces she is pregnant DiFranco honored at NOW convention|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060722/CITYANDREGION/307229989|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first Gulf War, DiFranco participated in the anti-war movement.

The club competes in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division. The team has played every home game in franchise history at [[Chase Field]], formerly known as ''Bank One Ballpark''. The Diamondbacks have won one [[World Series]] championship (defeating the [[New York Yankees]] in [[2001 World Series|2001]]) \u2013 becoming the fastest [[expansion team]] in the Major Leagues to win a championship, which it did in only the fourth season since [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|the franchise's inception]]. They remain the only major league sports team from Arizona to have won a championship title.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main article|History of the Arizona Diamondbacks}}\n{{See also|1998 Major League Baseball expansion}}\n\nOn March 9, 1995, Phoenix was awarded an expansion franchise to begin play for the {{mlby|1998}} season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Expansion Teams Put in Leagues|date=January 17, 1997|newspaper=Southeastern Missourian}}</ref> The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on March 31, [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]], at Bank One Ballpark. The [[Baseball park|ballpark]] was renamed Chase Field in 2005, as a result of [[Bank One Corporation]]'s merger with [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase & Co.]]\n\nSince their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five NL West division titles, one NL pennant, one Wild Card game, and the [[2001 World Series]].\n\n==Logos==\nThe Diamondbacks' original colors were [[purple]], [[black]], [[teal (color)|teal]] and [[copper (color)|copper]].<ref name=\"purplesedonared\">{{cite press release|title=D-backs shed their skin after unveiling new uniforms, colors on runway|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061108&content_id=1737471&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> Their first logo was an italicized block letter \"A\" with a diamond pattern, and the crossbar represented by a snake's tongue. Prior to their inaugural season, they released their baseball caps. The home cap had a cream color crown with a purple visor and button. The road cap was black and had a turquoise visor and button. Their alternate cap had a turquoise crown with a purple visor and button. Depending on the cap, the \"A\" logo on the front of the cap had different color variations.\n\nIn the Diamondbacks' second season, they introduced a new logo which was a copper color snake in the shape of a letter \"D\". It was used on a solid black cap, which in the beginning, was worn as a road cap.\n\nThe franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black on November 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs unveil new colors, new look|url=http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> The [[red]] shade is named for the [[sandstone]] [[canyon]] at [[Red Rock State Park]] near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], while the [[beige]] (sand) shade is named for the [[Sonoran Desert]].<ref name=\"purplesedonared\"/> A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase \"d\" and \"b\" configured to look like a snake's head.<ref name=\"purplesedonared\"/> The team also kept the \"D\" logo, but was slightly altered and put on an all red cap to be used as their game cap. They also kept the \"A\" logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. A similar color scheme is currently used by the [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]].\n\nPrior to the 2016 season, the Diamondbacks reincorporated teal into its color scheme while keeping Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black. They also unveiled eight different uniform combinations, including two separate home white and away grey uniforms. One major difference between the two sets is that the non-teal uniforms feature a snakeskin pattern on the shoulders, while the teal-trimmed uniforms include a charcoal/grey snakeskin pattern on the back. Arizona also kept the throwback pinstriped sleeveless uniforms from their 2001 championship season for use during Thursday home games.<ref name=\"GilbertDbacks\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona Diamondbacks 2016 Uniforms|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/ari/fan_forum/uniforms.jsp|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=LOOK: Diamondbacks unveil seven new uniforms for 2016|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Radio and television==\nThe primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was [[Thom Brennaman]], who also broadcasts baseball and [[college football]] games nationally for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Television]].

[[Greg Schulte]] is the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well known for his previous work on [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Arizona State University]] (ASU) broadcasts.\n\n[[Jeff Munn]] is a backup radio play-by-play announcer; he served as the regular public address announcer at [[Chase Field]] in the early days of the franchise. He is well known to many Phoenix area sports fans, having also served as the public address announcer for the Suns at America West Arena (now [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]]) in the 1990s. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women's basketball.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] since 2002, [[Daron Sutton]], would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton is considered one of the best of the younger generation of baseball broadcasters. His signature chants include \"let's get some runs\" when the D-backs trail in late innings.

In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].\n\nPhilosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.<ref>[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einf\u00fchrung in die \u00c4sthetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.</ref>\n\nAestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.<ref>Thomas Munro, \"aesthetics\", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.</ref>\n\n==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==\n\n===Aesthetic judgment<!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here-->===\n\nAesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> usually go beyond sensory discrimination.\n\nFor [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely \"the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition\", but also our sensitivity \"to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.\"<ref>David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.</ref> Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].\n\nFor [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), \"enjoyment\" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be \"beautiful\" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man \"If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me'',\" because \"Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]\". The case of \"beauty\" is different from mere \"agreeableness\" because, \"If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things.\"\n\nViewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}</ref> According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}</ref> In the opinion of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.<ref>{{cite book|first = W\u0142adys\u0142aw|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}</ref>\n\n====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====\n[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]\n\nJudgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his \u2018Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting\u2019 (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&nbsp;1\u201324. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.<ref>{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.<ref>Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.</ref> In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.<ref>Korsmeyer, Carolyn ed. ''Aesthetics: The Big Questions'' 1998</ref>\n\nAesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, \"Beauty and the Critic's Judgment\", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.\n\nA third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.<ref>Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in \"On Modernist Painting\" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.</ref> The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.\n\n===Aesthetic universals===\nThe philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:<ref name=\"Dutton\">[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''</ref>\n\n# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.\n# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.\n# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.\n# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.\n# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.\n# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.\n\nArtists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. \"Rules of composition\" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4\u203233\u2033]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as Andr\u00e9 Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea \"art\" itself) were non-existent.<ref>Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: Andr\u00e9 Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)</ref>\n\n===Aesthetic ethics===\nAesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]<ref>Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882\u20131953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.</ref> has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being \"fair\"\u2014the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]<ref>[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].\n\n==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.\n\nIn 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \"[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or \"intended meaning\" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.\n\nIn another essay, \"[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]],\" which served as a kind of sister essay to \"The Intentional Fallacy\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay \"Literature in the Reader\" (1970).<ref>Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2001.</ref>\n\nAs summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay \"The Creation of Art\": \"Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.\"<ref>Gaut and Livingston, \"The Creation of Art\", p.3.</ref> These authors contend that: \"Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.\"<ref name=\"Gaut and Livingston, p.6\">Gaut and Livingston, p.6.</ref>\n\nGaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: \"Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.\" They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, \"The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.\"<ref name=\"Gaut and Livingston, p.6\"/>\n\n==Derivative forms of aesthetics==\nA large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.\n\n===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===\n[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]\n\nEarly-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics & Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}</ref>\n\nVarious attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify \"beauty\" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].\n\n[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that \"expression\" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/}}</ref> [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a \"counter-environment\" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as \"kalliphobia\" (after the Greek word for beauty, \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ''kallos'').<ref>'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&nbsp;24\u201335</ref> [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later).

The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.<ref>[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&nbsp;36\u20137, 157, 238)</ref>\n\n===Aesthetics and science===\n[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]\n\nThe field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,<ref>Kobbert, M.

Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].<ref>[[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,<ref>Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008</ref> as reflected in the statement \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty\" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.<ref>Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: \"Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?\", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382</ref> Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.<ref>Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: \"The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment\", ''Psychonomic Bulletin & Review'', 15(6):1174\u20131178</ref> However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}</ref> and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}</ref> have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.\n\n===Computational approaches===\nIn 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.<ref name=\"Akiba2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117\u2013118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}</ref>\n\nSince about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Datta |first2=D. |last2=Joshi |first3=J. |last3=Li |first4=J. |last4=Wang |title=Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach |booktitle=Europ.

[[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By \"art\" we may frame several artistic \"works\" or \"creations\" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible \"art\" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as \"art\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the \"aesthetic\". He argues that Kant's \"aesthetic\" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid \"aesthetic\" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nTimothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics \"framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices\".<ref>{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&nbsp;283\u2013292.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Aesthetics}}\n* [[Art periods]]\n* [[History of aesthetics before the 20th century]]\n* [[Medieval aesthetics]]\n* [[Mise en sc\u00e8ne]]\n* [[Theory of art]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* [[Mario Perniola]], ''20th Century Aesthetics.

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf.

They founded several of the [[monarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], and their name is the root of the name England. The name comes from [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]], a peninsula located on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] shore of what is now [[Schleswig-Holstein]]{{reference needed|date=October 2018}}.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the Angles may have been first recorded in Latinised form, as ''Anglii'', in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]]. It is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited, the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] Peninsula (''Angeln'' in modern German, ''Angel'' in [[Danish language|Danish]]). This name has been hypothesised to originate from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root for \"narrow\" (compare German and Dutch ''eng'' = \"narrow\"), meaning \"the Narrow [Water]\", i.e. the [[Schlei]] [[estuary]]; the root would be ''angh'', \"tight\". Another theory is that the name meant \"hook\" (as in [[angling]] for fish), in reference to the shape of the peninsula; Indo-European linguist [[Julius Pokorny]] derives it from *ang-, \"bend\" (see ankle).<ref>Pyles, Thomas and John Algeo 1993. ''Origins and development of the English language''. 4th edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich). </ref> \n\nDuring the [[fifth century]], all Germanic tribes who invaded Britain were referred to as ''Englisc'', who were speakers of [[Old English]] (which was known as ''Englisc'', ''\u00c6nglisc'', or ''Anglisc''). ''Englisc'' also goes back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*h\u2082en\u01f5\u02b0-'', meaning narrow.<ref>Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. Other Indo-European languages have derivities of the PIE Sten or Lepto or Dol-\u0259'kho as root words for narrow. ''The English language. A historical introduction''. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press.</ref> In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a [[fishing]] people or were originally descended from such, so [[England]] would mean \"land of the [[Fisherman|fishermen]]\", and [[English language|English]] would be \"the fishermen's language\".<ref>Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 ''A history of the English language''. 4th edition. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall). </ref>\n\n[[Gregory the Great]], in an [[epistle]], simplified the Latinised name ''Anglii'' to ''Angli'', the latter form developing into the preferred form of the word. The country remained ''Anglia'' in Latin. [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s history of the world uses ''Angelcynn'' (-kin) to describe England and the English people; [[Bede]] used ''Angelfolc'' (-folk); also such forms as ''Engel'', ''Englan'' (the people), ''Englaland'',  and ''Englisc'' occur, all showing [[i-mutation]].<ref>Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell. </ref>\n\n==Greco-Roman historiography==\n\n===Tacitus===\n[[File:Angeln.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The map shows both the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia (Angeln)]] and the [[Schwansen]] peninsulas]]\n[[File:Over Jerstal.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Possible locations of the Angles and Jutes before their migration to Britain]]\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of the Angles may be in chapter 40 of Tacitus's ''Germania'' written around AD 98. Tacitus describes the \"Anglii\" as one of the more remote [[Suebi]]c tribes compared to the [[Semnones]] and [[Langobardi]], who lived on the [[Elbe]] and were better known to the Romans. He grouped the Angles with several other tribes in that region, the [[Reudigni]], [[Aviones]], [[Varini]], [[Eudoses]], [[Suarini]], and [[Nuitones]].{{sfnp|Tacitus|98|loc=[[s:la:De origine et situ Germanorum (Germania)#XL|Cap. XL]]}}{{sfnp|Church|1868|loc=[[s:Germany and Its Tribes#40|Ch.&nbsp;XL]]}} These were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods, and therefore inaccessible to attack.{{sfnp|Tacitus|98|loc=[[s:la:De origine et situ Germanorum (Germania)#XL|Cap. XL]]}}{{sfnp|Church|1868|loc=[[s:Germany and Its Tribes#40|Ch.&nbsp;XL]]}}\n\nHe gives no precise indication of their geographical situation, but states that, together with the six other tribes, they worshiped [[Nerthus]], or Mother Earth, whose sanctuary was located on \"an island in the Ocean\".{{sfn|Chadwick|1911|pp=18\u201319}} The Eudoses are the [[Jutes]], these names probably refer to localities in [[Jutland]] or on the Baltic coast. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps, and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who considered it unknown, inaccessible, with a small population and of little economic interest.\n\nThe majority of scholars believe that the Anglii lived on the coasts of the Baltic Sea, probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula. This view is based partly on Old English and Danish traditions regarding persons and events of the fourth century, and partly because striking affinities to the cult of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to be found in pre-Christian [[Scandinavia]]n religion.{{sfn|Chadwick|1911|pp=18\u201319}}\n\n===Ptolemy===\n[[Ptolemy]] writing in around 150 AD, in his atlas ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' (2.10), describes the ''Sueboi Angeilloi'', Latinised to ''Suevi Angili'', further south, living in a stretch of land between the northern Rhine and central Elbe, but apparently not touching either river, with the Suebic [[Langobardi]] on the Rhine to their west, and the Suebic [[Semnones]] on the Elbe stretching to their east.\n\nThese Suevi Angili would have been in [[Lower Saxony]] or near it, but they are not coastal. The three Suebic peoples are separated from the coastal [[Chauci]], (between [[Ems (river)|Ems]] and [[Elbe]]), and [[Saxones]], (east of the Elbe mouth), by a series of tribes including, between [[Weser]] and Elbe, the [[Angrivarii]], \"Laccobardi\" (probably another reference to Langobardi, but taken by Ptolemy from another source), and [[Dulgubnii]]. South of the Saxons, and east of the Elbe, Ptolemy lists \"Ouirounoi\" (Latinised as Viruni, and probably the Varini) and Teutonoari, which either denotes \"the Teuton men\", or else it denotes people living in the area where the Teutons had previously lived (whom Ptolemy places still living to the east of the Teutonoari). Ptolemy describes the coast to the east of the Saxons as inhabited by the [[Farodini]], a name not known from any other sources.\n\nOwing to the uncertainty of this passage,  much speculation existed regarding the original home of the Anglii. One theory is that they or part of them dwelt or moved among other coastal people, perhaps confederated up to the basin of the [[Saale]] (in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of [[Unstruttal (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Engilin]]) on the [[Unstrut]] valleys below the [[Kyffh\u00e4userkreis]], from which region the ''Lex Anglorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum'' is believed by many to have come.{{sfn|Chadwick|1911|pp=18\u201319}}<ref name=\"lex anglorum\">{{Cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Lex_Anglorum_et_Werinorum_hoc_est_Thuringorum|title=Lex Anglorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum - Wikisource|website=la.wikisource.org|language=la|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The ethnic names of [[Frisii|Frisians]] and [[Warini|Warines]] are also attested in these [[Saxon]] districts.\n\nA second possible solution is that these Angles of Ptolemy are not those of Schleswig, at all. According to [[Julius Pokorny]], the Angri- in [[Angrivarii]], the -angr in [[Hardanger]] and the Angl- in Anglii all come from the same root meaning \"bend\", but in different senses. In other words, the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond Germanic.\n\nHowever, Gudmund Sch\u00fctte, in his analysis of Ptolemy, believes that the Angles have simply been moved by an error coming from Ptolemy's use of imperfect sources. He points out that Angles are placed correctly just to the northeast of the Langobardi, but that these have been duplicated, so that they appear once, correctly, on the lower Elbe, and a second time, incorrectly, at the northern Rhine.{{sfnp|Sch\u00fctte|1917|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/34/mode/2up/search/angles 34] & [https://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/118/mode/2up/search/angles 118]}}\n\n==Medieval historiography==\n{{further|Kings of the Angles}}\n[[File:Beda Petersburgiensis f3v.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript of Bede]]\n[[Bede]] states that the Anglii, before coming to Great Britain, dwelt in a land called Angulus, \"which lies between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons, and remains unpopulated to this day.\" Similar evidence is given by the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. King [[Alfred the Great]] and the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]] identified this place with [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]], in the province of [[Schleswig]] (Slesvig) (though it may then have been of greater extent), and this identification agrees with the indications given by Bede.{{sfn|Chadwick|1911|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nIn the Norwegian seafarer [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]]'s account of a two-day voyage from the Oslo fjord to Schleswig, he reported the lands on his starboard bow, and Alfred appended the note \"on these islands dwelt the ''Engle'' before they came hither\".{{refn|group=n|See the translation by Sweet,{{sfnp|Sweet|1883|p=19}} noted by Loyn.{{sfnp|Loyn|1991|p=24}}}} Confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named [[Wermund]] and [[Offa of Angel]], from whom the [[Mercia]]n royal family claimed descent and whose exploits are connected with Anglia, Schleswig, and [[Rendsburg]]. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, [[Frowinus]] ([[Freawine]]) and [[Ket and Wig|Wigo]] (Wig), from whom the royal family of [[Wessex]] claimed descent. During the fifth century, the Anglii invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of the legal code issued to the [[Thuringii|Thuringians]]: ''Lex Anglorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum''.{{sfn|Chadwick|1911|pp=18\u201319}}<ref name=\"lex anglorum\"/>\n\nThe Angles are the subject of a legend about [[Pope Gregory I]], who happened to see a group of Angle children from [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] for sale as slaves in the Roman market. As the story would later be told by the Anglo-Saxon monk and historian [[Bede]], Gregory was struck by the unusual appearance of the slaves and asked about their background. When told they were called \"''Anglii''\" (Angles), he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: \u201c''Bene, nam et angelicam habent faciem, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes''\u201d (\"It is well, for they have an angelic face, and such people ought to be co-heirs of the angels in heaven\"). Supposedly, this encounter inspired the pope to launch a mission to bring Christianity to their countrymen.{{sfnp|Bede|731|loc=[[s:Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum - Liber Secundus|Lib.&nbsp;II]]}}{{sfnp|Jane|1903|loc=[[s:Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation (Jane)/Book 2|Vol.&nbsp;II]]}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe province of Schleswig has proved rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the fourth and fifth centuries. A large cremation cemetery has been found at [[Borgstedt]], between Rendsburg and [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]], and it has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in pagan graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at [[Thorsberg moor]] (in Anglia) and [[Nydam Mose|Nydam]], which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, etc., and in Nydam, even ships. By the help of these discoveries, Angle culture in the age preceding the invasion of Britannia can be pieced together.{{sfn|Chadwick|1911|pp=18\u201319}}\n\n==Anglian kingdoms in England==\n{{see also|Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxons|History of Anglo-Saxon England}}\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|right|Angles, Saxons, and Jutes throughout England]]\nAccording to sources such as the ''History'' of Bede, after the invasion of Britannia, the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of [[Northumbria]], [[East Anglia]], and [[Mercia]]. H.R. Loyn has observed in this context that \"a sea voyage is perilous to tribal institutions\",{{sfnp|Loyn|1991|p=25}} and the apparently tribe-based kingdoms were formed in England. Early times had two northern kingdoms (Bernicia and Deira) and two midland ones (Middle Anglia and Mercia), which had by the seventh century resolved themselves into two Angle kingdoms, viz., Northumbria and Mercia. Northumbria held suzerainty amidst the [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] presence in the British Isles in the seventh century, but was eclipsed by the rise of Mercia in the eighth century. Both kingdoms fell in the great assaults of the Danish [[Viking]] armies in the 9th century. Their royal houses were effectively destroyed in the fighting, and their Angle populations came under the [[Danelaw]]. Further south, the Saxon kings of [[Wessex]] withstood the Danish assaults. Then in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, the kings of Wessex defeated the Danes and liberated the Angles from the Danelaw. They united their house in marriage with the surviving Angle royalty, and were accepted by the Angles as their kings. This marked the passing of the old [[Anglo-Saxon]] world and the dawn of the \"[[English people|English]]\" as a new people. The regions of East Anglia and Northumbria are still known by their original titles. Northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast [[Scotland]], including [[Edinburgh]], and as far south as the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\nThe rest of that people stayed at the centre of the Angle homeland in the northeastern portion of the modern German ''Bundesland'' of Schleswig-Holstein, on the Jutland Peninsula. There, a small peninsular area is still called [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern [[Flensburg]] on the Flensburger Fjord to the [[City of Schleswig]] and then to Maasholm, on the [[Schlei]] inlet.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture|Anglo-Saxon England}}\n* [[Angeln]]\n* [[Anglo-Saxons]]\n* [[East Anglia]]\n* [[Kingdom of East Anglia]]\n* [[List of ancient Germanic peoples]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation |last=[[Bede|Beda]] |title=[[s:la:Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]] ''[''The Ecclesiastical History of the English People'']'' |date=731 |ref={{harvid|Bede|731}} }}. {{la icon}}\n* {{citation |last=[[Bede]] |title=''[[s:Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England|Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England: A Revised Translation]]'' |date=1907 |publisher=George Bell & Sons |location=London |orig-year=Reprinting [[Lionel Cecil Jane|Jane]]'s 1903 translation for J.M.

This was one of the things that was fixed soon after with the redesign to a commercial product.]]\nThe '''Aster CT-80''', an early (1982) [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]] developed by the small [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company MCP (later renamed to '''Aster Computers'''), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists. Later it was sold ready to use. It consisted of several [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] [[Printed circuit board|PCB's]] with [[DIN 41612]] connectors, and a [[backplane]] all based on a [[19-inch rack]] configuration. It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.<ref>Except perhaps for the [[Holborn System 9100]] computer which was a few months earlier, but which was designed and sold as a minicomputer at ten times the price of the Aster.</ref> The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy [[TRS-80]] computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run [[CP/M]] software, with a big amount of free memory [[CP/M#Transient_Program_Area|Transient Program Area]], (TPA) and a full 80\u00d725 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal. Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the [[TRS-80 Model III]], and ran all the software of these systems including games. It also had a built in speaker which was compatible with such games software.\n\n==Models==\nThree models were sold. The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the later [[IBM PC]] (which came on the market years later), a rectangular base unit with two [[floppy]] drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5\u00bc\" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened [[Apple II|Apple]] with a built-in keyboard.\n\nAll units ran much faster than the original [[TRS-80]], at 4 [[Megahertz|MHz]], (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set. The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 [[Kilobyte|KB]], more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80. A special version of [[NewDos/80]], (an improved [[TRS-DOS]] compatible [[Disk operating system]]) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.\n\nFor the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed. This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils. The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer. There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.\n\n==Working modes==\nThe Aster used 64KB of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully [[TRS-80]] compatible, with 48KB or RAM. When the boot loader detected a [[CP/M]] floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs ([[CP/M#Transient_Program_Area|TPA]]) and an 80 x 25 display. This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the [[Max-80|LOBO Max-80]].\n\nWith a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.\n\nA third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a [[Videotex]] terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.\n\n==Sales==\n\nMost Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the \"honderd scholen project\" (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools. MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands. Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that). Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to [[Philips]] and their [[Philips P2000|P2000]] homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in [[Austria]] and did not have network hardware nor software.\n\n==Company==\n\nAster computers was based in the small town of [[Arkel]] near the town of [[Gorinchem]].\nInitially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time . They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the \"[[Elektor Junior Computer|junior Computer]]\" from [[Elektor]] (a copy of the [[KIM-1]]), and the [[ZX80]] from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the [[Western Digital#Key innovations|WD1771]] floppy disc controller chip without an external \"data separator\". To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16&nbsp;KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64&nbsp;KB RAM chips.\nWhile this went on MCP renamed itself to ''MCP CHIP'' but ran into problems with the German computer magazine ''[[CHIP (magazine)|CHIP]]'', and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the [[TRS-80]], the [[Video Genie]], (another TRS-80 clone), the [[Luxor AB|Luxor]] [[ABC 80]] and the [[Apple II]].\nThey also sold the exotic [[Olivetti M20]], a very early 16-bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a [[Z8000]] CPU.\n\nAfter designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface. They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80. So they decided to design a TRS-80 and CP/M software-compatible computer system, which (following the lead of [[Apple Computer]]) they decided to name after a \"typical Dutch flower\". So they called it the Aster CT-80 ('''C'''P/M/'''T'''andy'''-'''19'''80'''). Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that \"Aster\" is also a Dutch girls' name has something to do with it. Remarkably \"Aster\" was also the name given to a Dutch [[Supercomputer]] much later, in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe first version of the Aster consisted of four \"[[Eurocard (PCB)|Eurocard]]'s\", one [[Z80]] CPU card with 64&nbsp;KB memory, one [[Motorola]] [[MC6845]]-based video card, one [[double density]] floppy disk controller card and one \"keyboard/[[RS232]]/cassette interface\" card. Plus a \"backplane card\", (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard. And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard. After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system. However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system. Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64\u00d716 portion of the 80\u00d725 screen)  with an improved font set (adding \"gray scale\" version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special [[PETSCII]] like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a [[19-inch rack]] for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply. A software engineer was hired to write the special \"dual boot mode\" BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS. The \"dual boot mode\" BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much \"workspace\" as possible, and the 80\u00d725 video mode. It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS232 port with modified cabling. The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the \"kit\" versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.\n\nSoon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.\n\nAfter the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the [[TRS-80 Model III]] computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did. In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.\n\nThe Aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high-capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Aster's high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers. The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems. The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units. Through a special \"video-switch\" the teacher was also able to see a copy of each student's display on his own screen. About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.\n\nBecause of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.\n\nPerhaps the Aster computer inspired another [[Netherlands|Dutch]] computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower&mdash;the [[Tulip Computers|Tulip's]] [[Tulip System-1]] which appeared about the same time Aster folded.\n\nMost of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) [[MSX]] system for a company called \"Micro Technology b.v.\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Unreleased add ons==\n\nTo enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).\n* A very High resolution monochrome video card with [[blitter]] and hardware text line and arc drawing capability, was designed for [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications, based on the [[NEC \u00b5PD7220]] chip designed for graphic terminals, but was also used by some personal computers like the DEC Rainbow, and notably also for the Tulip System I.\n* A colour video card with [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability based on the same video chip (the [[Texas Instruments TMS9918|TMS9918]]) as the [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI99/4]] and [[MSX]] computers, designed for gaming, and more creative and colorful educational software. A working prototype of this card was finished.\n* A replacement card for the original TRS-80 compatible video card, software compatible to the original one, but with added color and very high resolution capabilities. was also on the drawing board. Based on a newer, slightly more flexible, version of the Asters original [[Motorola]] MC6845 video chip, the [[Conexant|Rockwell]] 6545, it worked by adding a new video mode, one with the ability to reprogram an extended, (2048 characters instead of 256 characters) version of the [[character set]], supported by an extended character memory of the video card that did not use one (8 bit) byte per character, but an 11 bit \"word\", so it could address each one of the available 2048 unique programmable characters. This meant it could provide a separate programmable character for all of the 1024 (64x16) or 2000 (80x25) characters on the screen. By filling the character pointer memory with values from zero to 1919 this essentially turned the text mode display into a very high resolution graphics mode, with the \"font memory\", acting as the high resolution [[Raster graphics]] video memory. Because the characters were 8 x 12 pixels this meant that video resolutions of 512 x 192 pixels (in 64x16 character mode), or 640 x 300 pixels (in 80x24 character mode) were created, which was quite high for the time. The \"double width\" mode of the TRS-80 was also supported, so 256 x 192 pixels (in 32x16 character mode), or 320 x 300 pixels (in 40x24 character mode)  were also possible. The video card also supported 16 foreground and 16 background colors per character, by providing one byte per character position (2K) of \"color ram\". One nibble of such a byte then controlled the foreground color, and the other nibble controlled the background color, a system very similar to the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], in fact in the 256x192 mode the display mode was virtually identical to the video of the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. The color memory was also available in the \"normal\" TRS-80 and CP/M text modes, which meant that existing TRS-80 and CP/M software could be easily modified to add color. This video card would also support fast scrolling of high resolution color screens for games, because it had the indirection of the character pointers, so it was possible to quickly scroll the high resolution display, (or use other effects) by simply manipulating the 1920/1024 bytes of text video instead of the 24.576 bytes of high resolution video memory.\n\nA hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a [[SCSI]] interface, and the necessary software. A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.\n\nOn the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging \"user interface\" of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor [[CP/M#Console Command Processor|CCP]] ) with the more modern [[ZCPR]].\n\nFinally a replacement for the aging [[Z80]] processor was being developed in the form of an [[Intel 8086]] board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards. Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion. In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously. Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.\n\nUnfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.museo8bits.com/aster_ct80.htm Pictures of the Aster CT-80 model one from a Spanish computer museum, the educational model with an opening for a cassette player is the one on the right]\n* [http://niels.horn.tripod.com/_images/mkb_hist_1983.jpg A picture of the Aster CT-80 model two used for a business application]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111001080154/http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/tandy/clones/aster.jpg A picture of the Aster CT-80 model three without cover (Computermuseumgroningen does not have this item anymore)]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{TRS-80 and Tandy computers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aster Ct-80}}\n[[Category:Z80-based home computers]]\n[[Category:Home computers]]<!-- Leave this, otherwise navigation is impossible for those who don't know what a Z80 is -->\n[[Category:Personal computers]]\n[[Category:TRS-80]]", "sha1": "hkyebvx6m2unslbwlhan9antajg40xl"}}, {"title": "Arthur Wellesley", "ns": "0", "id": "2138", "revision": {"id": "767131856", "parentid": "767131818", "timestamp": "2017-02-24T03:44:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Neveselbert", "id": "25820411"}, "comment": "/* top */ Marquess of Douro", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Arthur Wellesley''' may refer to:\n\n*[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] (1769\u20131852), Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman\n*[[Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington]] (1807\u20131884), British soldier and nobleman\n*[[Arthur Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington]] (1849\u20131934), British soldier and nobleman\n*[[Arthur Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington]] (1876\u20131941), British soldier and nobleman\n*[[Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Douro]] (born 1978), grandson of the 8th Duke\n*[[Arthur Wellesley Hughes]] (1870\u20131950), also known as Arthur Wellesley, Canadian musician and composer\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arthur (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Wellesley (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Duke of Wellington (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{hndis|name=Wellesley, Arthur}}", "sha1": "6takiwffuhfz3nha0zrrkpwo30km97s"}}, {"title": "List of animated television series", "ns": "0", "id": "2139", "revision": {"id": "860660595", "parentid": "860633419", "timestamp": "2018-09-22T06:19:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Movies Time", "id": "30743163"}, "comment": "/* Lists by decade */ doesn't existed.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Lists of animated television series}}\nThese are '''lists of animated television series'''.

The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their [[manager (baseball)|manager]] was [[Frank Selee]]. Boston came to be called the ''Beaneaters'' in 1883, while retaining red as the team color. The [[1898 Boston Beaneaters season|1898 team]] finished 102\u201347, a club record for wins that would stand for [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|almost a century]]. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the \"Heavenly Twins\", [[Hugh Duffy]] and [[Tommy McCarthy]], as well as \"Slidin'\" [[Billy Hamilton (baseball, born 1866)|Billy Hamilton]].\n\n[[File:Hugh Duffy Baseball.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Hugh Duffy]] played with the franchise from 1892 to 1900 and won the third [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in MLB history]]\nThe team was decimated when the [[American League]]'s new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in ''The Sporting News Baseball Guide'' during the 1940s when each team's entry had a [[History of baseball team nicknames|history of its nickname(s)]].

Media-driven nickname changes to the ''Doves'' in 1907 and the ''Rustlers'' in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the ''Braves'' for the first time in 1912. Their owner, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], which used an Indian chief as their symbol.<ref>Kaese, Harold ''The Boston Braves'', Northeaster University Press, 1948.</ref>\n\n====1914: Miracle====\n{{main|1914 Boston Braves season}}\n\nTwo years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4\u201318 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the [[1914 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]].

Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics\u2014the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern [[World Series]] (the [[1907 World Series|1907 Series]] had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile, [[Johnny Evers]] won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Chalmers Award]].\n\nThe Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at [[Fenway Park]], since their normal home, the [[South End Grounds]], was too small. However, the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, [[Braves Field]], which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.\n\n====1915\u20131953====\nAfter contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]] bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great [[Christy Mathewson]], back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.\n\nFuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager [[Bill McKechnie]], but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the [[Great Depression]].\n\nLooking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the [[New York Yankees]] to acquire [[Babe Ruth]], who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down\u2014perhaps as early as 1936.<ref name=\"Neyer\">{{cite book|last=Neyer|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Neyer|title=Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders|year=2006|publisher=Fireside|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-8491-2 }}</ref>\n\nAt first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4\u20132 win over the [[1936 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.<ref name=\"Neyer\"/>\n\nSeeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1\u2014only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three [[home run]]s of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.<ref name=\"Neyer\"/> The Braves finished 38\u2013115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is [[List of worst MLB season records|the third-worst in baseball history]], and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 Cleveland Spiders]]).\n\nFuchs lost control of the team in August 1935,<ref name=\"Neyer\"/> and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the ''Boston Bees''. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate [[Lou Perini]], changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of [[Warren Spahn]] to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.\n\n[[File:Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn.png|thumb|Spahn (right) with [[Johnny Sain]]]]\nIn 1948, the [[1948 Boston Braves season|team]] won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and [[Johnny Sain]], who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, ''Boston Post'' writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:\n\n:''First we'll use Spahn''\n:''then we'll use Sain''\n:''Then an off day''\n:''followed by rain''\n:''Back will come Spahn''\n:''followed by Sain''\n:''And followed''\n:''we hope''\n:''by two days of rain.''\n\nThe poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as ''\"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain\"'', entered the baseball vocabulary. However, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had the same record in games that Spahn and Sain started that the team had overall, in terms of winning percentage.\n\nThe [[1948 World Series]], which the Braves lost in six games to the [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]], turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. In 1950, [[Sam Jethroe]] became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to [[Milwaukee]], where the Braves had their top farm club, the [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Brewers]]. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. [[Bill Veeck]] had tried to return his [[Saint Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.\n\n===Milwaukee (1953\u20131965)===\n{{see also|History of the Atlanta Braves#Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee went wild over the Braves, drawing a then-NL record 1.8&nbsp;million fans. The Braves finished 92\u201362 in their first season in Milwaukee. The success of the relocated team showed that baseball could succeed in new markets, and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[Saint Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]], [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] would leave their hometowns within the next five years.\n\n[[File:MilwaukeeBaseballM.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Milwaukee Braves cap logo]]\nAs the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers [[Eddie Mathews]] and [[Hank Aaron]] drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), often aided by another power hitter, [[Joe Adcock]], while [[Warren Spahn]], [[Lew Burdette]], and [[Bob Buhl]] anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nIn [[1957 Milwaukee Braves season|1957]], the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP season]], as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run [[walk-off home run]] that gave the Braves a 4\u20132 victory over the [[1957 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first [[World Series]] win in over 40 years, defeating the powerful [[1957 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] of [[Yogi Berra|Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle|Mantle]], and [[Whitey Ford|Ford]] in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories against his former team, giving up only two earned runs.\n\nIn [[1958 Milwaukee Braves season|1958]], the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the [[1958 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP [[Bob Turley]]'s pitching.\n\nThe [[1959 Milwaukee Braves season|1959 season]] saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], both with 86\u201368 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].\n\n[[File:MilwaukeeBraves5461.png|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Milwaukee Braves logo (1953\u20131956)]]\nThe next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], who ultimately were to win the [[1960 World Series|World Series]] that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]]. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.\n\nAaron hit 45 [[home run]]s in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. [[1963 in baseball|The next season]], Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23\u20137. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the \"[[first division (baseball)|second division]]\", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Braves were mediocre as the 1960s began, with an inflated win total fed by the expansion [[New York Mets]] and [[Houston Colt .45s]]. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.\n\nPerini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by [[William Bartholomay]] in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor\n[[Ivan Allen, Jr.]] constructed a new $18&nbsp;million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, [[Atlanta Stadium]], which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the [[Kansas City Athletics|Kansas City A's]] to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.\n\n[[Eddie Mathews]] is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.\n\n===Atlanta (1966\u2013present)===\n\n====1966\u20131974====\nThe Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85\u201377 in 1966, 77\u201385 in 1967, and 81\u201381 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever [[National League West]] Division title, before being swept by the \"[[1969 New York Mets season|Miracle Mets]]\" in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 \u2013 in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.\n\n[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of [[Turner Field]].]]\nIn the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of [[Hank Aaron]]. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium (\"The Launching Pad\"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in [[Rico Carty]] (in 1970) and [[Ralph Garr]] (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 \u2013 [[Darrell Evans]] and [[Davey Johnson]] along with Aaron.\n\nBy the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. The [[1974 Major League Baseball season|next season]], it was only a matter of time before he set a new record. On April 4, opening day, he hit No.714 in [[1974 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]] of the [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], while Ruth finished his career as a Boston Brave. In fact, until [[Barry Bonds]] eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by [[Babe Ruth]] in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.\n\n====1976\u20131977: Ted Turner buys the team====\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f 10.1.jpg|thumb|Media magnate [[Ted Turner]] purchased the team in 1976, and played a large role in the team's operation.]]\n\nIn 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate [[Ted Turner]], owner of [[superstation]] [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]]. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself [[manager (baseball)|manager]], but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the [[1977 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] lost 2\u20131 to the [[1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] to bring their losing streak to 17 games).\n\nTurner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as \"The Atlanta Braves: [[America's Team]]\", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially [[Southern United States|the South]]. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname \"Channel\" for pitcher [[Andy Messersmith]] and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired [[Braves TBS Baseball|Braves games]]. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.\n\n====1978\u20131990====\n[[File:PhilNierko1982.jpg|thumb|left|[[Phil Niekro]] played with the Braves from 1964 to 1983 and in 1987; he holds the MLB record for most wins by a [[knuckleball]] pitcher]]\n\nAfter three straight losing seasons, [[Bobby Cox]] was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season. He promoted 22-year-old slugger [[Dale Murphy]] into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with [[Joe Torre]], under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from [[Bob Horner]], [[Chris Chambliss]], pitcher [[Phil Niekro]], and short relief pitcher [[Gene Garber]] helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove award]]. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]. Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Indian-themed mascot, [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]].\n\n====1991\u20132005: Division dominance====\n\n=====1991\u20131994=====\n{{multiple image\n| footer = [[Greg Maddux]], [[Tom Glavine]], and [[John Smoltz]] combined for six [[Cy Young Award]]s during their time in the Braves pitching rotation\n| width = 140\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 =\n| alt1 = Greg Maddux\n| image2 = Tom Glavine Pitching 1993.jpg\n| alt2 = Tom Glavine\n| image3 = JohnSmoltz.jpg\n| alt3 = John Smoltz\n}}\n\nCox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing [[Russ Nixon]]. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65\u201397. They traded Dale Murphy to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]] began developing young pitchers [[Tom Glavine]], [[Steve Avery]], and [[John Smoltz]] into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the [[1990 Major League Baseball draft|1990 MLB draft]] to select [[Chipper Jones]], who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, [[John Schuerholz]] was hired away from the [[Kansas City Royals]] as general manager.\n\nThe following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players [[David Justice]], [[Ron Gant]] and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion [[Terry Pendleton]], the [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] overcame a 39\u201340 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the [[1991 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The \"Worst to First\" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a very tightly contested seven-game [[1991 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] only to lose the [[1991 World Series|World Series]], also in seven games, to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.\n\nDespite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] returned to the [[1992 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and once again defeated the [[1992 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] in seven games, culminating in a [[Francisco Cabrera game|dramatic game seven win]]. [[Francisco Cabrera (baseball)|Francisco Cabrera]]'s two-out single that scored [[David Justice]] and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3\u20132 victory. It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the [[1992 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], however. In 1993, the Braves signed [[Cy Young Award]] winning pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]], leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball. The [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|1993 team]] posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], who won 103 games. The Braves needed a stunning 55\u201319 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the [[1993 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] to the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.\n\nIn 1994, in a realignment of the [[National League]]'s divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.<ref name=Realignment/> This realignment was the main cause of the team's [[Braves\u2013Mets rivalry|heated rivalry]] with the [[New York Mets]] during the mid-to-late 1990s.<ref name=RivalryWithMets/><ref name=SubwaySeries>{{cite book|title=The subway series: the Yankees, the Mets and a season to remember|year=2000|publisher=The Sporting News|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-89204-659-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=From Wild Card to World Series|date=October 17, 2000|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=Murray Chass}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|player's strike]] cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] with 48 games left to play.\n\n=====1995\u20132005=====\nThe Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[1995 World Series]]. This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the \"[[Buffalo Bills]] of Baseball\" (January 1996 issue of ''Beckett [[Baseball Card]] Monthly''). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the {{World Series Year|1996}} and [[1999 World Series]] (losing both to the [[New York Yankees]], managed by [[Joe Torre]], a former Braves manager),<ref name=SubwaySeries/> and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization&nbsp;\u2014Cox was the Braves' manager, while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.\n\nIn October 1996, Time Warner acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves. Over the next few years, Ted Turner's presence as owner of the team would diminish.\n\n[[File:1995 World Series trophy.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The [[1995 World Series]] [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] on display in the [[Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame]] at [[Turner Field]]]]\nA 95\u201367 record in {{World Series Year|2000}} produced a ninth consecutive division title.

One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played [[Braves\u2013Mets rivalry|rival]] [[New York Mets]] in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\nIn 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the [[2002 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], and [[2006 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]].\n\n=====Cy Young dominance=====\nSix National League [[Cy Young Award]]s in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:\n* In 1991, left-handed pitcher [[Tom Glavine]] received his first award.\n* Right-handed pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] won four in a row, three of them with the Braves from 1993 through 1995.

The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ([[Wilson Betemit]], [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]], [[Pete Orr]], [[Ryan Langerhans]], [[Jeff Francoeur]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, and pitcher [[Kyle Davies (baseball)|Kyle Davies]] all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the \"Baby Braves\" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90\u201372.\n\nHowever, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the [[2005 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] to the [[2005 Houston Astros season|Astros]] in four games. In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a [[Lance Berkman]] [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and a two-out, ninth inning [[Brad Ausmus]] home run off of Braves closer [[Kyle Farnsworth]]. The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50&nbsp;minutes. [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]] ended the marathon with a home run off of [[Joey Devine]].\n\nAfter the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]], who left to go to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. [[Roger McDowell]] took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]], the Braves acquired shortstop [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] from the Boston Red Sox.\n\n====2006: Struggles====\n{{main|2006 Atlanta Braves season}}\n[[File:Andruw Jones.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andruw Jones]] at bat for the Braves in 2006]]\n\nIn 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6\u201321 record during June, the worst month ever in Atlanta with a winning percentage of .222; this was only better than the woeful [[1935 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] in May 1935 (4\u201320) with a .166 winning percentage.\n\nAfter the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the [[1897 Boston Beaneaters season|Boston Beaneaters]] totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 \u2013 June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the [[1930 New York Yankees season|1930 New York Yankees]] to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8\u20133 victory over [[2006 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie [[Paul Waner]]'s 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.<ref>''The Sporting News Baseball Record Book'', 2007, p.&nbsp;29.</ref>\n\nHowever, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the [[2006 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' 11-year reign over the NL East. On September 24, the Braves' loss to the [[2006 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season. Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie [[Chuck James]] besting [[Roger Clemens]], Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79\u201383.\n\n====Sale to Liberty Media====\nIn December 2005, team owner [[Time Warner]], who inherited the Braves after purchasing [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]] in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/09/23/MN70161.DTL|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|date=September 23, 1995|title=Time Warner Closes Deal for Turner|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/14/news/fortune500/braves_sale/|last=Isidore|first=Chris|date=December 14, 2005|title=Time Warner considers Braves sale|publisher=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Liberty Media]] began negotiations to purchase the team.\n\nIn February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to [[Liberty Media|Liberty Media Group]] (a company which owned a large amount of stock in [[Time Warner|Time Warner, Inc.]]), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, [[Bud Selig]].

On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman [[Chipper Jones]] would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team. The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher [[Derek Lowe]], shortstop [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (shortstop, born 1977)|Alex Gonz\u00e1lez]], and outfielder [[Nate McLouth]]. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder [[Michael Bourn]], along with shortstops [[Tyler Pastornicky]] and [[Andrelton Simmons]]. To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to [[Brandon Beachy]]), manager Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez elected relief pitcher [[Kris Medlen]] to the starting pitching rotation. The Braves went on to win every game Medlen started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the [[Washington Nationals]] in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race.

Umpire [[Sam Holbrook]] called Simmons out, citing the [[infield fly rule]]. Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out.

The home uniforms consist of a standard white uniform, a red, military appreciation jersey worn with the standard white pants, and a cream alternate uniform. The road uniforms consist of a standard gray uniform, and an alternate navy blue jersey worn with the standard gray pants.\n\nThe white home uniform, introduced in 1987, is the primary home uniform. The jersey has \"Braves\" written in script across the chest with the tomahawk logo underneath. The jersey also includes piping around the collar and down the front of the jersey and around the bottom of the sleeves. Player numbers appear on the back of the jersey with a nameplate above. The Braves script, player numbers, and piping are red with a navy blue border. The tomahawk is primarily red with blue and yellow detail and a navy blue border. The white pants have identical piping to the jersey about the belt loops and down the outside seam of the pants. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a white nameplate. The player names originally used vertically arched lettering but, since 2006, the team has used radially arched lettering. The white uniform is paired with the standard home cap. It is a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a white embroidered \"script A\" logo. The home batting helmet is identical to the primary home cap.<ref>{{cite web|title=Braves Uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/braves/history/uniforms|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=January 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe gray road uniforms are the primary road uniform. The uniforms are identical to the white home uniforms with the exception of the \"Braves\" script, which is replaced by the \"Atlanta\" script. Player names are sewn to a gray nameplate. The primary uniforms are very similar to the uniforms that the Braves wore from 1946 to 1965\u2014during their latter years in Boston and throughout their tenure in Milwaukee.\n\nThe red, military appreciation jersey was introduced on February 5, 2014. The jerseys feature navy blue piping with a white border, the Braves script in blue with white stars, and the American Flag on the left sleeve. The updated red jerseys will not include the tomahawk logo. The jerseys will be worn for five home games in 2014: April 26 vs. the Cincinnati Reds (military family night), June 13 vs. the LA Angels of Anaheim (celebrating the Army), July 26 vs. the San Diego Padres (celebrating the Marines), Aug. 30 vs. the Miami Marlins (celebrating the Navy), and September 19 vs. NY Mets (celebrating the Air Force).<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=Carroll Rogers|title=Braves to honor military with alternative jerseys|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-to-honor-military-with-alternative-jerseys/ndDzJ/|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref>  The jerseys will be paired with camouflage caps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/gallery/sports/baseball/braves-introduce-alternate-jersey/gCHSL/|title=Braves introduce alternate jersey|publisher=}}</ref>  The military appreciation jerseys replace the red jerseys introduced in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=David|title=Braves\u2019 home-red jerseys dropped from lineup|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-home-red-jerseys-dropped-from-lineup/ndFBp/|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=February 5, 2014|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref>  Worn with the white pants, these jerseys included the same elements as the white jerseys, with the Braves script, player numbers, and piping in navy blue with a white border. The tomahawk was primarily blue, with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player names consisted of white lettering sewn to a red nameplate. These jerseys were paired with an alternate home cap, which was a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a red, embroidered \"script A\" logo with a tomahawk, outlined in white. The alternate cap did not have a matching batting helmet. The red alternate jerseys were worn for Sunday home games from 2005 to 2011. The only exceptions to this were the opening game of the 2005 [[National League Division Series|NLDS]], which was played on a Wednesday, and on Memorial Day in 2006. The 2006 Memorial Day game is also the only time the red jerseys were paired with the primary home cap. With the introduction of the cream uniform in 2012, the red jerseys were worn for Friday night home games from 2012 to 2013. However, the Braves chose to wear the traditional white jerseys for their 2012 home opener, which took place on Friday, April 13.\n\nThe cream alternate uniforms were introduced in February 2012 as a tribute to the Braves' first season in Atlanta in 1966. The jersey includes the \"Braves\" script across the breastplate, but the player number replaces the tomahawk underneath the \"Braves\" script on the left placket. Player numbers and the \"Braves\" script are in red with a navy blue border. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a cream nameplate. The jersey has a thin, navy piping about the collar and down the front of the jersey. There is no piping around the sleeves. The cream pants include piping identical to the jersey down the outside seam. The left sleeve of the jersey has a \"crossed tomahawk\" logo that replaces the \"screaming Indian\" logo that appeared on the 1966 jerseys. The new logo has two, primarily red, crossed tomahawks. Underneath the tomahawks is a blue circle outlined in red, with \"1876\" in red above (commemorating the year the franchise was founded), and \"Atlanta Braves\" in white below. The cream uniforms are paired with the standard home cap and are worn for Saturday and Sunday home games.<ref>{{cite news|title=Atlanta Braves unveil a new alternate home uniform|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/braves-unveil-new-alternate-home-uniform/c-26583682|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe alternate navy blue road jerseys were introduced on opening night of the 2008 season against the Washington Nationals. Worn with the gray road pants, the jerseys feature the \"Atlanta\" script on the breastplate in navy blue with a white outline. The tomahawk is primarily navy blue with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player numbers are blue with white borders and the player names are white letters sewn to a navy blue nameplate. The navy blue jerseys have no piping either on the sleeves or around the collar.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2008, the red brimmed, primary home cap was also worn on the road. However, when the navy blue jerseys were introduced in 2008, they were paired with a navy blue cap, similar to the team's road cap worn from 1966 to 1971. While the red brimmed cap was still primarily worn with the gray road uniforms, the team sometimes wore the navy blue cap with the gray jerseys, and the red brimmed cap was occasionally worn with the navy blue jerseys. The red brimmed home batting helmets were also worn on the road from 1987 through 2008. Beginning in 2009, the navy blue cap became the official road cap and was paired with a navy blue road batting helmet.\n\nUnlike the home uniforms, which are worn based on a schedule, the road uniforms are chosen on game day by the starting pitcher. However, they are also subject to [[Major League Baseball]] rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and sometimes when the home team chooses to wear black.\n\n==Logos==\n{{see also|Native American mascot controversy#Atlanta Braves||label 1= Native American, Atlanta Braves logo information}}\nFrom 1945 to 1955 the Braves primary logo consisted of the head of an Indian warrior.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boston Braves Logos |url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/5933/Boston_Braves |website=SportsLogos.net |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> From 1956 to 1965 it was a laughing Indian with a mohawk and one feather in his hair.<ref>{{cite news |title=Milwaukee Braves Logos |url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/84/Milwaukee_Braves |website=SportsLogos.net |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> When the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966, the \"Braves\" script was added underneath the laughing Indian.<ref name=alogo>{{cite news |title=Atlanta Braves Logos |url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/51/Atlanta_Braves |website=SportsLogos.net |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 1985, the Braves made a small script change to the logo.<ref name=alogo /> The Braves modern logo debuted in 1987.<ref name=alogo /> The modern logo is the word \"Braves\" in cursive with a tomahawk below it.<ref name=alogo /> In 2018, the Braves made a subtle color change to the primary logo.<ref name=alogo />\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Awards===\n{{main|Atlanta Braves award winners and league leaders}}\n\n===Team records===\n{{main|List of Atlanta Braves team records}}\n\n===Team captains===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n*[[Johnny Evers]] 1914\u20131917\n*[[Eddie Mathews]] 1965\u20131966\n*[[Hank Aaron]] 1969\u20131974\n*[[Bob Horner]] 1982\u20131986\n*[[Dale Murphy]] 1987-1990\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{{See also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\n\nThe Braves have retired eleven numbers in the history of the franchise, including most recently [[Chipper Jones]]' number 10 in 2013, [[John Smoltz]]'s number 29 in 2012, [[Bobby Cox]]'s number 6 in 2011, [[Tom Glavine]]'s number 47 in 2010, and [[Greg Maddux]]'s number 31 in 2009.

This generation includes the [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]], and, in certain markets, the [[Acorn Archimedes]]. \"ST\" officially stands for \"Sixteen/Thirty-two\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of Atari Computing|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv4n5/the_future.html|date=December 1989|work=[[STart Magazine]]|accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref> which refers to the [[Motorola 68000]]'s [[16-bit]] external bus and [[32-bit]] internals.\n\nThe ST was sold with either Atari's color monitor or the less expensive [[monochrome monitor]]. The system's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor.\n\nIn some markets, particularly [[Germany]], the machine gained a strong foothold as a [[small business]] machine for [[CAD]] and [[desktop publishing]] work. Thanks to its built-in [[MIDI]] ports, the ST enjoyed success for running [[music sequencer|music-sequencer]] software and as a [[MIDI controller|controller]] of [[musical instrument]]s among both amateurs and well-known musicians.\n\nThe ST was superseded by the [[Atari STE]], [[Atari TT]], [[Atari MEGA STE]], and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] computers.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home-computer makers [[Atari, Inc.]] and [[Commodore International]].\n\n=== Amiga contract ===\n[[Jay Miner]], one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]], tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small [[think tank]] called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new \"Lorraine\" chipset. The company, which was later renamed [[Amiga Corporation]], was pretending to sell video game controllers to deceive competition while it developed a Lorraine-based computer.<ref>{{YouTube|VCREhVvHXL4|\"History of Amiga video\"}} (2008-02-18). Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nAmiga ran out of capital to complete Lorraine's development, and Atari, owned by [[Warner Communications]], paid Amiga to continue development work. In return Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named \"Mickey\", and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed \"Minnie\".<ref>[http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html \"Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement\" and \"Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor\"].

Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\n=== Tramiel Technology ===\nAfter leaving [[Commodore International]] in January 1984, [[Jack Tramiel]] formed Tramel<!--*Not* \"Tramiel\"--> Technology with his sons and other ex-Commodore employees and, in April, began planning a new computer. The company initially considered the [[National Semiconductor]] [[NS320xx]] microprocessor but was disappointed with its performance.{{r|3years}}{{r|chin19850128}} This started the move to the 68000. The lead designer of the Atari ST was ex-Commodore employee [[Shiraz Shivji]], who had previously worked on the [[Commodore 64]]'s development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZS_gXpshd4C&pg=PT230|title=Classic Videogame Hardware Genius Guide|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|page=230|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>''[[InfoWorld]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nDAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44 October 16, 1989, page 44]</ref>\n\nTramiel learned that Warner wanted to sell Atari which, in mid-1984, was losing about a million dollars per day.<ref name=\"timemag\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/22/magazine/a-78-million-year-steve-ross-defends-his-paycheck.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A $78 Million Year: Steve Ross Defends His Paycheck | first=Roger | last=Cohen | date=1992-03-22}}</ref> Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, Tramiel negotiated with Warner in May and June 1984. He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new [[Atari Corporation]], Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets.\n\nThe Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of Atari Inc., so one of their first acts was to interview Atari Inc. employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially a brand new company. This company was originally called TTL (Tramiel Technologies Limited), later renamed to Atari Corp. At the time of the purchase of Atari Inc's assets, there were roughly 900 employees remaining from a high point of 10,000. After the interviews, approximately 100 employees were hired to work at Atari Corp.\n\nAt one point a custom sound processor called AMY was a planned component for the new ST computer design, but the chip needed more time to complete, so AMY was dropped in favor of an off-the-shelf Yamaha sound chip.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIt was during this time in late July/early August that Leonard Tramiel discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel<!--*Not* \"Tramiel\"--> Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga).\n\n=== Commodore and Amiga ===\nHaving heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.\n\nAt Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the [[operating system]] (OS) developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the [[Amiga 1000]] with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news |first = Jeffrey |last = Daniels |title = 3 Years With the ST |url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/threeyearsofst.html |work = START Magazine |publisher = James Capparell |page = 22 |date = Summer 1988 |accessdate = 2010-05-15 }}</ref><ref name=\"jayminer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.heartbone.com/comphist/JayMiner.html |title=Jay G.

Soon after the Atari buyout, [[Microsoft]] approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to the platform, but the delivery date was out by two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was [[Digital Research]], who was working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise to do so.<ref name=\"3years\"/>\n\nDigital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the \"Monterey Team\" which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Leonard Tramiel was the Atari person overseeing \"Project Jason\" (a.k.a. The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers. The name came from the original designer and developer, Jason Loveman.<ref name=\"oren\">{{cite web|last1=Oren|first1=Tim|title=Professional GEM Column #15|url=http://cd.textfiles.com/crawlycrypt1/program/books/progem/gemdos.15|website=textfiles.com|publisher=Antic Publishing|date=1986}}</ref>\n\nGEM was based on CP/M-68K, essentially a direct port of [[CP/M]] to the 68000. By 1985, CP/M was becoming increasingly outdated; it did not support sub-directories, for example. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new [[DOS]]-like operating system specifically for GEM, ''GEMDOS'', and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of [[Atari TOS]] (''The Operating System'' and colloquially known as the ''Tramiel Operating System''). This gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drives, plus programmers had function calls similar to [[IBM PC DOS]]. The [[Atari ST character set|character set]] is based on [[codepage 437]].\n\nBesides the original TOS operating system, a number of third-party OSes were developed or ported to the Atari ST. Among Unix clones, [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]], [[Minix]] had an Atari ST port and the [[MiNT|Mint]] OS was developed specifically for the Atari ST.\n\n== Debut and release ==\nAfter six months of intensive effort following Tramiel's takeover, Atari announced the 520ST at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"3years\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Winter CES 1985 Report|url=http://obligement.free.fr/articles_traduction/winter_ces_1985_en.php}}</ref> ''InfoWorld'' described prototypes shown at computer shows as a \"typical Commodore-64-style, corner-cutting, low-cost Jack Tramiel product\",<ref name=\"iw19850415\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA13&ots=a_Fs_n1Np8&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=GEM on ROM for the Atari ST | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-04-15 | accessdate=4 February 2015 | pages=13 | editor=McCarthy, Michael}}</ref> but Atari unexpectedly displayed the ST at Atlanta [[COMDEX]] in May.<ref name=\"sanger19850513\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/13/business/atari-is-facing-new-doubts.html |title=Atari is Facing New Doubts |last=Sanger, David E. |date=1985-05-13 |work=The New York Times |access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> Due to its similarities to the original [[Apple Macintosh]] and Tramiel's role in its development, it was quickly nicknamed the '''Jackintosh'''.<ref name=chin19850128>{{cite news|author=Chin, Kathy|title=Atari Announces Six New Computers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=InfoWorld|publisher=IDG|date=1985-01-28|accessdate=2011-03-19|pages=15\u201316}}</ref> Atari's rapid development of the ST amazed many,<ref name=\"3years\"/><ref name=\"chin19850128\" /> but others were more skeptical, citing the ST's \"cheap\" appearance, Atari's uncertain financial health, and the poor relations the Tramiel-led Commodore had with software developers.<ref name=\"chin19850128\" /><ref name=\"sanger19850513\" /><ref name=\"chinsoft19850128\" />\n\nAs early as 1981, [[Adam Osborne]] wrote that while Tramiel \"deserves credit for what he has been able to accomplish\", \"the microcomputer industry abounds with horror stories describing the way Commodore treats its dealers and its customers.\"<ref name=\"osborne19810413\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP42&rview=1&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Portable Osborne | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-04-13 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Osborne, Adam | pages=42\u201343}}</ref> In 1984 ''[[Ahoy!]]'' had written that Tramiel \"had never been able to establish very good relations with computer dealers ...

However, the ST initially shipped with ''TOS'' on disk, requiring 206&nbsp;KB RAM when loaded, leaving no or little room for applications. The 260ST did make its way into Europe on a limited basis.{{fact|date=April 2018}} Early models were designed with six [[read-only memory|ROM]] sockets allow easy upgrading to the future ROM-based ''TOS''.<ref name=\"byte198601\" /> These became available only a few months later and were included in all new machines as well as being available as an upgrade for older machines. By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an [[RF modulator]] (for TV display), a version known as the 520ST<sup>M</sup>. ST systems before the Mega ST range have no battery-backed clock.\n\nAtari originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI ([[Virtual Device Interface]]) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other [[Device file|devices]] simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping and was included in software packages and later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.\n\n[[File:ST BASIC - J.R. Bob Dobbs.gif|thumb|The face of J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs]]\nA limited set of GEM fonts were included in the ROMs, including the standard 8x8 pixel graphical character set for the ST.

Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was \"power without the price.\" In fact, an Atari ST and [[terminal emulation]] software was much cheaper than a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VT220]] terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Original housing ===\n[[File:Atari-520ST.jpg|thumb|The Atari 520ST]]\n\nThe original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky{{snd}} Atari's chief Industrial Designer.<ref name=\"case\">{{cite web|title=Bold plans for new Atari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=si4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=ira+velinsky#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=December 1984|work=[[InfoWorld]]|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref> The ST is wedge-shaped, featuring bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard has soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the [[Commodore 64]], but with a larger keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad.\n\nThe 520ST uses an external [[power brick]].\n\n=== Port connections ===\n[[File:Atari520ST Interface.jpg|thumb|Atari 520ST ports]]\n[[File:Atari st mouse.jpg|thumb|Atari ST mouse (2000)]]\n\nThe 520ST features a large number of ports mounted at the rear of the machine that remained largely unchanged over the ST's history.\n\n* Standard ports:\n** [[RS-232]]c serial port ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] male, operating as basic 9-conductor DTE)\n** [[Centronics printer port]] ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] female, officially compliant only with the most basic unidirectional standard with a single, \"Busy\" input line; unofficially offering some bidirectional capabilities)\n** [[Atari joystick port]]s ([[D-subminiature|DE-9]] male) for the mouse and game controllers\n** 2 [[MIDI]] ports (5-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]], \"IN\" and \"OUT\")<ref name=\"midi\">{{cite web |title=Atari ST Interfaces & Connectors |url=http://info-coach.fr/atari/hardware/interfaces.php |website=info-coach.fr |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n* ST-specific ports:\n** Monitor port (custom 13-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]], 12 of the pins in a rectangular pattern, carrying signals for both RGB and monochrome monitors, monophonic audio and, in later models, composite video)\n** ACSI (similar to [[SCSI]]) DMA port (custom-sized 19-pin D-sub, for hard disks and laser printers, capable of up to 2&nbsp;MByte/s with efficient programming)\n** Floppy port (standard{{snd}} if rare{{snd}} 14-pin DIN, listed as operating at 250 kbit/s)\n** ST cartridge port (double-sided 40-contact edge connector socket, for 128&nbsp;KB [[ROM cartridge]]s)\n\nBecause of its [[parallel communication|bi-directional]] design, the Centronics printer port can be used for joystick input, and several games make use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.\n\n===Monitor===\nThe ST supports a [[monochrome monitor|monochrome]] or color monitor. The color hardware supports two different resolutions, 320 \u00d7 200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640 \u00d7 200 with 4 out of 512 colors. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 \u00d7 400 at 71.25&nbsp;Hz. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so software either supports both types of monitors or only works with one.<ref name=\"byte198601\">{{cite magazine | title=The Atari ST | magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=January 1986 | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-01/1986_01_BYTE_11-01_Robotics#page/n85/mode/2up | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last1=Edwards | first1=Jon R. | last2=Robinson | first2=Phillip | last3=McLaughlin | first3=Brenda | pages=84}}</ref> Color is required by a majority of games.\n\n===Floppy drive===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nAtari initially used single-sided [[floppy disk|disk drives]] that could store up to 360&nbsp;kB.<!-- Is this 360x10^3 bytes, or 360x2^10? --> Later drives were double-sided and stored 720&nbsp;kB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating [[early adopter]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAnother sticking point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under [[MS-DOS]] on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to{{snd}} but not themselves create{{snd}} discs in the same particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS because of different field usage on the FAT filesystem.{{clarify|date=April 2014}} Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms using floppies thus required pre-formatting dedicated file transfer discs under MS-DOS, and copying the necessary data onto them from any unsuitable Atari formatted discs, or by using a conversion utility such as MOSDOS.TOS to adapt an ST disk to make it readable on a PC. This formatting issue was soon resolved by the emergence of third-party formatting and file copier software, MS-DOS disc imaging software capable of reading the unusual formats used by the ST and various other machines (such as the Commodore Amiga) and, a few years later, Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades.\n\n=== STF and STFM models ===\n[[File:Atari ST 1040.jpg|thumb|Atari 1040ST<sup>F</sup>]]\n\nAtari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the ''1040ST<sup>F</sup>'' (also written ''STF''). The machine is generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided [[floppy drive]] into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk drive now sat, were moved to a niche underneath the keyboard.\n\nThe ''1040ST'' was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1&nbsp;MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of ''[[Byte Magazine|BYTE]]'' in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier;<ref name=\"byte198603\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-03/1986_03_BYTE_11-03_Homebound_Computing#page/n91/mode/2up | title=The Atari 1040ST | work=BYTE | date=March 1986 | accessdate=4 July 2014 |author1=Robinson, Philip |author2=Edwards, Jon R. | pages=84}}</ref><ref name=\"3years\"/> ''[[Compute!]]'' noted that, in fact, the ''1040ST'' was the first computer to break the $2500/megabyte price barrier.<ref name=\"halfhilll198604\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n31/mode/2up | title=A Turning Point For Atari? | work=Compute! | date=April 1986 | accessdate=8 November 2013 | author=Halfhill, Tom R. | pages=30}}</ref> However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the ''XE series'' of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe same basic design was also used for a cut-down version, the 512 kB ''520STFM'', which replaced the earlier 520ST models in the market. The early 'STF' machines lack the 'M' modulator that allows a TV to be used and will only work with a monitor.\n\n=== Mega models ===\nInitial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market,<ref name=\"3years\"/> with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.\n\nTo address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the ''ST1''. Debuted at Comdex in 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the ''Mega'', this new machine includes a high-quality detached keyboard, a stronger case to support the weight of a monitor, and an internal bus expansion connector. A 20 MB hard drive called the SH204 could be purchased as an option and stacked below or above the main case of the Mega. The upcoming [[SLM804]] [[laser printer]] would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It would attach to the Mega through the ST DMA port and require the Mega computer to render the pages. As TOS was not a [[multitasking]] OS, this meant the computer could not be used while printing. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB (a 1 MB version, the ''Mega 1'' would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package, which received acclaim and was featured on the cover of Computer Shopper magazine.\n\nA custom [[blitter]] co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the ''Mega 2'' and ''Mega 4'' machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly written programs using the screen VDI commands can use the blitter seamlessly, since GEM [[Application programming interface|API]] is a higher-level interface to ''TOS''.\n\n== Later models ==\n\n=== STE models ===\nIn late 1989, [[Atari]] released the 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup> (also written STE), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It features an increased color palette of 4,096 colors from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution, and even fewer in higher resolutions), [[Genlock]] support, and a [[blitter]] co-processor (stylized as \"BLiTTER\") which can quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics data) around in RAM.  The STE was the first Atari with PCM audio; using a new chip, it added the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples at 6258&nbsp;Hz, 12517&nbsp;Hz, 25033&nbsp;Hz and even 50066&nbsp;Hz, via DMA (Direct Memory Addressing). The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes.  RAM was now much more simply upgradable via [[SIMM]]s.\n\nTwo enhanced joystick ports were added (two normal joysticks can be plugged into each port with an adapter), with the new connectors placed in more easily accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in Atari's [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] console and are compatible.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some [[Application software|applications]] and video games written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behavior with a few applications (such as the [[WYSIWYG]] word-processor application [[1st Word/1st Word Plus|1st Word Plus]]). Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software was rare.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe last STE machine, the ''[[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]'', is an STE in a grey [[Atari TT030|Atari TT]] case that had a switchable 16&nbsp;MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional [[Motorola 68881]] [[floating point unit|FPU]], built-in 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk drive, [[VMEbus|VME]] expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's [[LocalTalk]]) and an optional built-in 3\u00bd\" hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.\n\n=== Atari TT ===\n{{Main|Atari TT030}}\n\nIn 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented ''Atari TT030'', based on a 32&nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68030]] processor. The \"TT\" name (\"Thirty-two/Thirty-two\") continued the nomenclature system as the 68030 chip had full 32-bit wide buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.\n\n=== Atari Falcon ===\n{{Main|Atari Falcon}}\n\nThe final ST computer is the multimedia-capable ''Atari Falcon030''. Like the TT, this was also 68030-based, operating at 16&nbsp;MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board [[Motorola 56000|Motorola 56001]] audio [[digital signal processor]]. The Falcon, like the [[Atari STE]], supports sampling frequencies above 44.1&nbsp;kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340&nbsp;Hz, which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies. Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066&nbsp;Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST<sup>F</sup> and ST<sup>E</sup>. Aftermarket upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.\n\nReleased in 1992, the Falcon was discontinued by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licensed the Falcon design from Atari, and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case). The C-Lab Falcons were also imported to the US by at least some Atari dealers.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nIn 1993, Atari ceased development on the ST computers to focus on the [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]].\n\nFollowing the exit of Atari from the computer market, both Medusa Computer Systems and Milan Computer manufactured Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used [[Motorola 68040|68040]] and [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors. The [[Atari Coldfire Project|FireBee]] is an Atari ST/TT clone based on the [[Freescale ColdFire|Coldfire]] processor.\n\n== Software ==\nAs with the Atari 8-bit computers,<ref name=\"cgw198604\">{{cite magazine | title=Survey of Game Manufacturers | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=27 | date=April 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_27.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | pages=32}}</ref><ref name=\"williams198610\">{{cite magazine | title=Atari Playfield | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=31 | date=September\u2013October 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_31.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | last=Williams | first=Gregg | pages=35}}</ref><ref name=\"brooks198705\">{{cite magazine | title=Computer Wargaming 1988-1992 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=37 | date=May 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_37.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | last=Brooks | first=M.

Within 30 days of releasing the non-[[copy protection|copy protected]] ST version, the game was available on BBSs with maps and [[code wheel]]s. Because the ST market was smaller than that for the IBM PC it was more vulnerable to piracy which, Louie said, seemed to be better organized and more widely accepted for the ST. He reported that the Amiga version sold in six weeks twice as much as the ST version in nine weeks, and that the Mac and PC versions had four times the sales.

The popular Windows/Macintosh applications ''[[Cubase]]'' and ''[[Logic Pro]]'' originated on the Atari ST (the latter as ''Notator Logic'', preceded by ''Creator'', ''Notator'' and ''Notator-SL''). Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's ''KCS'', contains a \"Multi-Program Environment\" that allows ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.<ref>[http://tamw.atari-users.net/omega.htm Dr T'S Kcs And Tiger Cub]. Tamw.atari-users.net. Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nMusic [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] software was popular on the ST, such as the ''TCB Tracker'', aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').\n\nAn innovative music composition program that combines the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) is called ''Quartet'' (after its four-note polyphonic tracker, which displays one monophonic stave at a time on color screens).\n\nDue to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition. The Microdeal ''[[Replay Professional]]'' product features a sound sampler that cleverly uses the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]. For output of digital sound, it uses the on-board frequency output, sets it to 128&nbsp;kHz (inaudible) and then modulates the amplitude of that.\n\nAnother program that had success on the ST platform is ''[[MasterTracks Pro (software)|MasterTracks Pro]]'' from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh. When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format.

This software was created by [[Gene Mosher]] under the [[ViewTouch]]<ref>Bisson, Giselle. [http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv2n6/gettingdowntobusiness.html Getting Down To Business].

It does not feature the Atari ST's GEM graphical user interface but, instead, features an application specific graphical user interface and widget framework which he developed using, in part, the [[Neochrome]] paint program.\n\n=== Software development ===\nThe initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. At $5,000, this discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (no hardware) for $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement). The third-party [[Megamax C]] development package reduced the cost of entry to $200.\n\nThe ST came bundled with a system disk that contained [[ST BASIC]], the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as HiSoft BASIC, [[GFA BASIC]], FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to be supplied as a ROM cartridge), [[DTACK Grounded|DBASIC]], and ''[[STOS BASIC programming language|STOS]]'', which then inspired and led to the creation of AMOS on the Amiga,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and was powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and a host of good quality shareware and public domain games. In the late years of the Atari ST Omikron Basic was bundled with it in Germany.\n\nOther development tools include 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, [[HiSoft Systems]]'s Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal (OSS Personal Pascal, Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), [[Modula-2]], C compilers ([[Lattice C]], [[Megamax C]], [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU C]], Aztec C, AHCC), [[LISP]], [[Prolog]], [[Logo programming language|Logo]], and others.\n\n=== Games ===\n{{see also|List of Atari ST games|Category:Atari ST games}}\nThe ST enjoyed success in gaming due to the low cost, fast performance, and colorful graphics. Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Doug Bell]], [[Jeff Minter]], [[\u00c9ric Chahi]], [[Jez San]], and [[David Braben]].\n\nThe realtime pseudo-3D [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'', was developed and released first on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Simulation games like ''[[Falcon (video game)|Falcon]]'' and ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator#History|Flight Simulator II]]'' made use of the ST's graphics, as did many arcade ports. Proto first person shooter ''[[MIDI Maze]]'', uses the [[MIDI]] ports to connect up to 16 machines for networked deathmatch play. The critically acclaimed ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with the engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animations created on the Amiga. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that didn't use the Amiga's superior graphics and sound capabilities were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Garry Kasparov]] became the first player to register the commercial ''[[ChessBase]]'', a popular commercial database program produced for storing and searching records of games of chess. The first version was built for Atari ST with his collaboration in January 1987.<ref>Chessdatabase and Gary Kasparov http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4007229</ref> In his autobiography ''Child of Change'', he regards this facility as \"the most important development in chess research since printing.\"\n\n=== Utilities ===\nUtility software was available to drive hardware add-ons such as video digitisers. Office Productivity and graphics software was also bundled with the ST ([[HyperPaint II]] by [[Dimitri Koveos]], [[HyperDraw]] by [[David Farmborough]], [[3D-Calc]] spreadsheet by [[Frank Schoonjans]], and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of [[Electronic Arts]]).\n\nThere was a thriving output of [[public domain]] and [[shareware]] software which was distributed by, in the days long before public internet access, [[public domain software library|public domain software libraries]] that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up [[bulletin board system]]s.\n\nRemarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid-'90s and the birth of the modern, publicly accessible Internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard-storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical World Wide Web browser applications were available and usable on the ST.\n\nThere were also DOS emulators released in the late 1980s. ''PC-Ditto'' came in two versions, software-only-, and a hardware version that plugs into the cartridge slot or kludges internally. After running the PC-Ditto software, a DOS boot disk is required to load the system. Both allow users to run DOS programs in [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] mode, though much more slowly than on an [[IBM PC]]. Other options are the ''PC-Speed'' ([[NEC V30]]), ''AT-Speed'' ([[Intel 80286]]) and ''ATonce-386SX'' ([[80386SX|Intel 80386sx]]) hardware emulator boards.\n\n==Popularity with musicians==\nThe ST's low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians:\n\n* German electronic music pioneers [[Tangerine Dream]] relied heavily on the Atari ST in the studio and for live performances during the late 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n3/tangerinedream.html|title=Making Tracks With MIDI - A Profile of Tangerine Dream|author=Mard Naman|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n* The album notes for [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Earth Moving]]'' state that it was recorded using an Atari ST and C-Lab MIDI software.\n* The [[Fatboy Slim]] album ''You've Come A Long Way, Baby'' has an Atari ST in the large foldout picture of Fatboy Slim's studio.\n* [[Electronic music]] artists [[Mike Paradinas]] and [[Luke Vibert]] started out writing music on Atari STs.\n* In the Paris performance of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s album ''Waiting for Cousteau'', musicians have attached Atari ST machines with unidentified MIDI software to their keyboards, as could be seen in the TV live show and video recordings.\n* [[White Town]]'s \"[[Your Woman]]\", which reached #1 in the UK singles charts, was created using an Atari ST.<ref>[http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered!].

This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) [[Read-only memory|ROM]] versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became ST<sup>F</sup>s, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS: 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an [[RF Modulator]] that allows the machine to be hooked to a color TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50&nbsp;Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the ''520ST<sup>M</sup>'' (or ''520STM''). Later ''F'' and ''FM'' models of the 520 had a built in [[double-sided disk]] drive instead of a single-sided one.\n\n=== ST<sup>E</sup> ===\nAs originally released in the ''520ST<sup>E</sup>/1040ST<sup>E</sup>'':\n\n* All of the features of the 520STFM/1040STFM\n* Extended palette of 4,096 available colors to choose from\n* [[BLiTTER]] chip for copy/fill/clear large data blocks in memory (max write rate of 4 MB/s)\n* Hardware-support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and split screen (using the Shifter video chip)\n* DMA [[sound chip]] with 2-channels stereo 8-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sound at 6.25/12.5/25/50&nbsp;kHz and stereo RCA audio-out jacks (using enhancements to the Shifter video chip to support audio shifting)\n* [[National LMC 1992]] audio controller chip, allowing adjustable left/right/master volume and bass and treble EQ via a [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus#Microwire|Microwire]] interface\n* Memory: 30-pin [[SIMM]] memory slots ([[SIPP memory|SIPP]] packages in earliest versions) allowing upgrades up to 4 MB Allowable memory sizes including only 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MB due to configuration restraints (however, 2.5 MB is not officially supported and has compatibility problems). Later 3rd-party upgrade kits allow a maximum of 14MB [http://www.stcarchiv.de/stc1997/03_magnumst.php w/Magnum-ST], bypassing the stock [[Memory management unit|MMU]] with a replacement unit and the additional chips on a separate board fitting over it.\n* Ability to synchronise the video-timings with an external device so that a video [[Genlock]] device can be used without having to make any modifications to computer's hardware\n* Analogue joypad ports (2), with support for devices such as paddles and light pens in addition to joysticks/joypads. The [[Atari Jaguar]] joypads and Power Pad joypads (gray version of Jaguar joypads marketed for the ST<sup>E</sup> and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]]) can be used without an adapter. Two standard Atari-style digital joysticks could be plugged into each analogue port with an adapter.\n* [[Atari TOS|TOS]] 1.06 (also known as TOS 1.6) or TOS 1.62 (which fixed some major backwards-compatibility bugs in TOS 1.6) in two socketed 128 kB ROM chips.\n* Socketed [[Plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]] [[68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]]\n\n== Models ==\nThe members of the ST family are listed below, in rough chronological order:\n\n; 520ST: Original model with 512&nbsp;KB RAM, external power supply, no floppy disk drive. The early models had only a bootstrap ROM and TOS had to be loaded from disk.\n; 520ST+: early 520STs with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM, but without floppy disk\n; 260ST: originally intended to be a 256&nbsp;kB variant, but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512&nbsp;KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512&nbsp;KB models from the 1&nbsp;MB models. Because the early 520ST's were sold with TOS on disk, but this used up 192&nbsp;KB or RAM so the machine only had around 256KB left.\n; 520ST<sup>M</sup>: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output, 512&nbsp;KB RAM.\n; 520ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single sided drive only), and 512&nbsp;KB RAM.\n; 1040ST<sup>F</sup>: a 520STFM with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive, but without RF modulator\n; 1040ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STFM with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive with RF modulator\n; Mega ST (MEGA 1, MEGA 2, MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1, 2 or 4&nbsp;MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\" case with a detached keyboard. All MEGA mainboards have a PLCC socket for the BLiTTER chip and some early models did not include the BLiTTER chip. They also included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector. Some early MEGA 2 had a MEGA 4 mainboard with half of the memory chip places unpopulated and the MEGA 2 can be upgraded by adding the additional DRAM chips and some resistors for the control lines. The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned memory chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only places for the 1&nbsp;MByte DRAM chips.\n; 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup>: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, a BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040 style all-in-one case\n; [[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16&nbsp;MHz processor with 16K cache, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in an ST gray version of the TT case\n; [[STacy]]: a [[portable computer|portable]] (but definitely not [[laptop]]) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard, an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res, and a mini-trakball intended mostly for travellers and musicians because of the backlight screen and its built-in midi ports. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard [[C battery|C cell]] flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut.\n; [[ST BOOK]]: a later portable ST, more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this{{snd}} notably the backlight, and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal [[flash memory]] 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light, it is fixed to the 640 \u00d7 400 1-bit mono mode, and no external video port was provided. Despite its limitations, it gained some popularity, particularly amongst musicians.\n\n=== Unreleased ===\n; 130ST: intended to be a 128&nbsp;KB variant. Announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced.\n; 4160ST<sup>E</sup>: as 1040ST<sup>E</sup> but with 4&nbsp;MB of RAM. Never officially released except a small quantity of development units.

At age 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After facing [[Aaliyah#Illegal marriage|allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly]], Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].\n\nAaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'', which sold 3 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \"[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]\". The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this goal. \"Try Again\" also earned Aaliyah a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her role in ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'', and released her third and final studio album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'', in 2001.\n\nOn August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in [[the Bahamas]] after filming the music video for the single \"[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]\". The pilot, Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and [[toxicology]] tests revealed that he had traces of [[cocaine]] and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases, and has sold an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide.

She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: \"I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on.\" She did this in her own life, as she planned to \"fall back on\" another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, \"when you pick a career it has to be something you love\".<ref name=Sutherland2 />\n\n==Career==\n===1991\u20131995: ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number''===\n[[File:Ballasyrkellypic.jpg|thumb|left|Aaliyah was introduced to [[R.

[[Personal armour]] is used to protect soldiers and [[war animal]]s. [[Vehicle armour]] is used on [[warship]]s and [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s.\n\nA second use of the term '''armour''' describes [[Division (military)#Armoured division|armoured forces]], [[Armour#Armoured fighting vehicles|armoured weapons]], and their role in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] and their weapons came to be referred to collectively as \"armour\".\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Paris bordone 016.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Gentleman in armour with two pages.'' [[Paris Bordone]].]]\nThe word \"armour\" began to appear in the Middle Ages as a derivative of Old French. It is dated from 1297 as a \"mail, defensive covering worn in combat\". The word originates from the Old French ''armure'', itself derived from the Latin ''armatura'' meaning \"arms and/or equipment\", with the root ''armare'' meaning \"arms or gear\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of armour in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/armour|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Personal ==\n{{Main|Body armor}}\n\nArmour has been used throughout [[recorded history]]. It has been made from a variety of materials, beginning with rudimentary leather protection{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and evolving through [[Mail (armour)|mail]] and metal plate into today's modern [[composite armour|composites]]. For much of [[military history]] the manufacture of metal personal armour has dominated the technology and employment of armour. Armour drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood [[laminate|lamination]], mining, [[Refining (metallurgy)|metal refining]], vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the [[industrial revolution]], and furthered commercial development of metallurgy and engineering. Armour was the single most influential factor in the development of [[firearm]]s, which in turn revolutionised warfare.\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|The [[Dendra panoply]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] armour, circa 1400 BC]]\n\nSignificant factors in the development of armour include the economic and technological necessities of its production. For instance, [[plate armour]] first appeared in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]] when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. Also, modern militaries usually do not equip their forces with the best armour available because it would be prohibitively expensive. At times the development of armour has paralleled the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.\n\nWell-known armour types in [[European history]] include the [[lorica hamata]], [[lorica squamata]], and the [[lorica segmentata]] of the [[Roman legions]], the [[mail (armour)|mail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] [[knight]]s, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914\u201315). The [[samurai]] warriors of feudal Japan utilised [[Japanese armour|many types of armour]] for hundreds of years up to the 19th century.\n\n==== Early ====\n[[Cuirass]]es and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.<ref>Farris 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dCNioYQ1HfsC&pg=PA75 p. 75]</ref> ''Tank\u014d'', worn by foot soldiers and ''keik\u014d'', worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early [[Japanese armour]] constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. Japanese lamellar armour (''keiko'') passed through Korea and reached Japan around the 5th century.<ref>Robinson 2002, p. 10</ref> These early Japanese lamellar armours took the form of a sleeveless jacket, leggings and a helmet.<ref>Robinson 2002, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nArmour did not always cover all of the body; sometimes no more than a helmet and leg plates were worn. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a large shield. Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the Aztecs (13th to 15th century CE).<ref>Fagan 2004, {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn East Asia many types of armour were commonly used at different times by various cultures, including [[scale armour]], [[lamellar armour]], [[laminar armour]], [[plated mail]], [[Chainmail|mail]], [[plate armour]] and [[brigandine]]. Around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used partial plates for \"important\" body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The other body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, or Mountain pattern. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros.\n\n[[Mail (armour)|Mail]], sometimes called \"chainmail\", made of interlocking iron rings is believed to have first appeared some time after 300 BC. Its invention is credited to the [[Celts]]; the Romans are thought to have adopted their design.<ref>Gabriel 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA79 p. 79]</ref>\n\nGradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. Hardened leather and [[splint armour|splinted]] construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The [[coat of plates]] was developed, an armour made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.\n\n===== 13th to 18th century Europe =====\n\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr Siegel 2.jpg|thumb|A royal seal (early 15th century) depicting [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], Prince of [[Wales]], in full armour, riding his full barded steed, they are both wearing gold dragon headgear symbolising Arthurian legend]]\n\nEarly plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th\u201315th century, were made of iron. Iron armour could be [[Carburising|carburised]] or [[Case hardening|case hardened]] to give a surface of harder steel.<ref>Williams 2003, pp. 740\u2013741.</ref> Plate armour became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labour and labour had become much more expensive after the [[Black Death]], though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger [[Bloomery|blooms]]. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 55</ref>\n\nThe small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the [[bascinet]], as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century.\n\n[[File:MET Armures.jpg|thumb|Heavily armoured riders and their [[barding|barded]] [[war horse]]s, 16th century]]\nProbably the most recognised style of armour in the world became the [[plate armour]] associated with the [[knight]]s of the European [[Late Middle Ages]], but continuing to the early 17th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] in all European countries.\n\nBy about 1400 the full harness of plate armour had been developed in armouries of Lombardy.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 53.</ref> Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armour.\n\nIn the early 15th century, advances in weaponry allowed infantry to defeat armoured knights on the battlefield. The quality of the metal used in armour deteriorated as armies became bigger and armour was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14\u201315th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15&nbsp;kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25&nbsp;kg.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 916</ref> The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armour therefore gave substantial resistance.\n\nIn the early years of low velocity firearms, full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. In effect, rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebuseers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century. It was the only way they could be mounted and survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.\n\nThe horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate [[barding]]. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armour.\n\n==== Later ====\n[[File:Elements of a Light-Cavalry Armor MET DT780.jpg|thumb|''Elements of a Light-Cavalry Armor'', ca. 1510, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elements_of_a_Light-Cavalry_Armor_MET_DT780.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]\nGradually, starting in the mid-16th century, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers.\n\nBack and breast plates continued to be used throughout the entire period of the 18th century and through Napoleonic times, in many European (heavy) cavalry units, until the early 20th century. From their introduction, [[musket]]s could pierce plate armour, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. In Japan armour continued to be used until the end of the samurai era, with the last major fighting in which armour was used happening in 1868.<ref>Robinson 1951, {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> [[Japanese armour|Samurai armour]] had one last short lived use in 1877 during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]].<ref>Robinson 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kh-to448NTEC&pg=PA208 p. 208]</ref>\n\nThough the age of the knight was over, armour continued to be used in many capacities. Soldiers in the American Civil War bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected body armour for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely\u2014some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives, but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.<ref>Stewart, pp.74\u20135</ref>\n\nAt the start of World War I, thousands of the French [[Cuirassier]]s rode out to engage the German Cavalry. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against [[sabre]]s and light [[lance]]s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s, unlike the foot soldiers, who at least had a [[trench]] to protect them.\n\n==== Present ====\nToday, [[ballistic vest]]s, also known as [[flak jacket]]s, made of ballistic cloth (e.g. [[kevlar]], [[dyneema]], [[twaron]], [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|spectra]] etc.) and ceramic or metal plates are common among police forces, [[security guard|security staff]], [[prison officer|corrections officers]] and some branches of the military.\n\nThe US Army has adopted [[Interceptor body armour]], which uses Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (E-S.A.P.I) in the chest, sides and back of the armour. Each plate is rated to stop a range of ammunition including 3 hits from a [[7.62\u00d751 NATO]] AP round at a range of {{convert|10|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>ArmorUP</ref> [[Dragon Skin body armour]] is another ballistic vest which is currently in testing with mixed results.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:GayaironarmorFINAL.JPG|Early Korean armour of Gaya, its nickname as the kingdom of Steel.

The first [[tanks]] were produced during World War I. Aerial armour has been used to protect pilots and aircraft systems since the First World War.\n\nIn modern ground forces' usage, the meaning of armour has expanded to include the role of troops in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] were mounted in armoured fighting vehicles and replaced [[light infantry]] in many situations. In modern armoured warfare, armoured units equipped with tanks and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s serve the historic role of both the [[heavy cavalry|battle cavalry]], [[light cavalry]] and [[dragoon]]s, and belong to the armoured branch.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Ships ====\n{{further|Warship}}\n[[File:HMS Warrior (1860).jpg|left|thumb|[[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']] during her third commission between 1867 and 1871]]\n\nThe first [[ironclad]] battleship, with iron armour over a wooden hull, ''[[French battleship La Gloire|La Gloire]]'', was launched by the [[French Navy]] in 1859<ref>Sondhaus, pp.73\u20134</ref> prompting the British [[Royal Navy]] to build a counter. The following year they launched [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']], which was twice the size and had iron armour over an iron hull. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first battle between two ironclads]] took place in 1862 during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the [[Ship of the line|unarmoured line-of-battle ship]] as the most powerful warship afloat.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 86.</ref>\n\nIronclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas [[battleship]]s, coastal defence ships, and long-range [[cruiser]]s. The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel which carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea){{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.\n\nThe rapid pace of change in the ironclad period meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were complete, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the [[naval ram|ram]] or the [[torpedo]], which a number of naval designers considered the crucial weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ''ironclad'' dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or [[armoured cruiser]]s.\n\n==== Trains ====\n[[File:Wagon pancerny s.jpg|thumb|upright|An armoured train from 1915]]\n\n[[Armoured train]]s saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880\u201381 and 1899\u20131902),the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919\u20131921); the [[World War I|First]] (1914\u20131918) and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] (1939\u20131945) and the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920).\n\n[[Armored car (military)|Armoured cars]] saw use during World wars 1 and 2.\n\nDuring the [[Second Boer War]] on 15 November 1899, [[Winston Churchill]], then a war-correspondent, was travelling on board an armoured train when it was ambushed by Boer commandos. Churchill and many of the train's garrison were captured, though many others escaped, including wounded placed on the train's engine.\n\n==== Armoured fighting vehicles ====\n{{Main|Vehicle armour|Armoured fighting vehicle}}\n\nAncient [[siege engines]] were usually protected by wooden armour, often covered with wet hides or thin metal to prevent being easily burned.\n\nMedieval [[war wagon]]s were horse-drawn wagons that were similarly armoured.  These contained guns or crossbowmen that could fire through gun-slits.\n\nThe first modern [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]] were [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], developed circa 1900.  These started as ordinary wheeled motor-cars protected by iron shields, typically mounting a [[machine gun]].<ref>Macksey, Kenneth (1980). ''The Guinness Book of Tank Facts and Feats''. Guinness Superlatives Limited, {{ISBN|0-85112-204-3}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] during on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] spurred the development of the [[tank]].  It was envisioned as an armoured machine that could advance under fire from enemy rifles and machine guns, and respond with its own heavy guns. It utilized [[caterpillar track]]s to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches.\n\n==== Aircraft ====\nWith the development of effective [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in the period before the Second World War, military pilots, once the \"knights of the air\" during the First World War, became far more vulnerable to ground fire. As a response armour plating was added to aircraft to protect aircrew and vulnerable areas such as fuel tanks and engine.\n\n==== Present ====\n[[File:Abrams-transparent.png|thumb|left|The [[United States Military|US Military]]'s [[M1 Abrams]] [[Main battle tank|MBT]] uses [[composite armour|composite]], [[reactive armour|reactive]], and [[cage armour]]]]\n[[Image:Pannzerung plastische deformation.png|thumb|right|Swebor-brand high-strength low alloy steel plate, showing both sides, after [[plastic deformation]] from defeating [[projectile]]s in [[ballistics]] testing. Note: When exposed to fire, steel first expands and then loses its strength, exceeding critical temperature at 538\u00b0C or 1000\u00b0F per [https://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm ASTM E119] unless treated with [[fireproofing]].]]\n\nTank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms, now incorporating not only harder [[Composite armour|composites]], but also [[reactive armour]] designed to defeat [[shaped charge]]s. As a result of this, the [[main battle tank]] (MBT) conceived in the [[Cold War]] era can survive multiple [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle. The [[light tank]]s that were the last descendants of the [[light cavalry]] during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the world's militaries due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle-mounted infantry.\n\nThe [[armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) was devised during World War I. It allows the safe and rapid movement of infantry in a combat zone, minimising casualties and maximising mobility. APCs are fundamentally different from the previously used armoured [[half-track]]s in that they offer a higher level of protection from artillery [[Air burst|burst]] fragments, and greater mobility in more terrain types. The basic APC design was substantially expanded to an [[Infantry fighting vehicle]] (IFV) when properties of an armoured personnel carrier and a [[light tank]] were combined in one vehicle.\n\nNaval armour has fundamentally changed from the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], [[bomb]]s and [[torpedo]]es. Passive defence naval armour is limited to [[kevlar]] or steel (either single layer or as [[spaced armour]]) protecting particularly vital areas from the effects of nearby impacts. Since ships cannot carry enough armour to completely prevent penetration by [[anti-ship missile]]s, they depend more on destroying an incoming missile before it hits, or causing it to miss its target.\n\nAlthough the role of the ground attack aircraft significantly diminished after the [[Korean War]], it re-emerged during the [[Vietnam War]], and in the recognition of this, the US Air Force authorised the design and production of what became the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] dedicated anti-armour and [[ground-attack aircraft]] that first saw action in the [[Gulf War]].\n\n[[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]] are often required to defeat [[ballistics]] from small arms as well as projectiles from [[Bushing (electrical)|transformer bushings]] and [[lightning arrester]]s, which form part of large electrical [[transformer]]s, per [https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=850 NFPA 850]. Such fire barriers may be designed to inherently function as armour, or may be  [[passive fire protection]] materials ''augmented by armour'', where care must be taken to ensure that the armour's reaction to fire does not cause issues with regards to the fire barrier being armoured to defeat explosions and projectiles in addition to fire, especially since both functions must be provided simultaneously, meaning they must be fire-tested together to provide realistic evidence of fitness for purpose.\n\n[[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|Combat drones]] use little to no vehicular armour as they are not manned vessels, this results in them being lightweight and small in size.\n\n== Animal armor ==\n\n=== Horse armour ===\n{{Main|Barding}}\n\n[[Image:Dresden-Zwinger-Armoury-Armor.02.JPG|right|200px|thumb|A sixteenth-century knight with a horse in full barding]]\n'''Barding''' (also spelled ''bard'' or ''barb'') is [[body armour]] for [[Horses in warfare|war horses]], especially as used by European [[knight]]s.\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages]] as armour protection for knights became more effective, their mounts became targets. This vulnerability was exploited by the [[Scotland|Scots]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in the 14th century, when horses were killed by the infantry, and for the [[England|English]] at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] in the same century where [[English longbow|longbowmen]] shot horses and the then dismounted [[France|French]] knights were killed by [[heavy infantry]]. Barding developed as a response to such events.\n\nExamples of armour for horses could be found as far back as [[classical antiquity]]. [[Cataphracts]], with [[scale armour]] for both rider and horse, are believed by many historians to have influenced the later European knights, via contact with the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"Nell, Grant S. 1995\">Nell, Grant S.

AFVs can be wheeled or [[Continuous track|tracked]]. [[Main battle tank]]s, [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], armoured [[self-propelled gun]]s, and [[armoured personnel carrier]]s are all examples of AFVs.\n\nArmoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. The classifications are not absolute; two countries may classify the same vehicle differently, and the criteria change over time. For example, relatively lightly armed [[armoured personnel carrier]]s were largely superseded by [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s with much heavier armament in a similar role.\n\nSuccessful designs are often adapted to a wide variety of applications.  For example, the [[MOWAG Piranha]], originally designed as an [[Armored personnel carrier|APC]], has been adapted to fill numerous roles such as a [[mortar carrier]], [[infantry fighting vehicle]], and [[assault gun]].\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Evolution of AFVs ==\n[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gem\u00e4lde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Zama]] by [[Henri-Paul Motte]], 1890]]\n\nThe concept of a highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries; from [[Hannibal]]'s war elephants to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]'s contraptions, military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers.  \n\nArmoured fighting vehicles were not possible until [[internal combustion engine]]s of sufficient power became available at the start of the 20th century.\n\n=== History ===\n{{main|Armoured warfare}}\n[[File:Helepolis.png|right|thumb|A [[Helepolis]]-like Siege Engine showing ballistae, stairs and movement capstan]]\nModern armoured fighting vehicles represent the realization of an ancient concept - that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower. Armies have deployed war machines and cavalries with rudimentary armour in battle for millennia. Use of these animals and engineering designs sought to achieve a balance between the conflicting [[paradox]]ical needs of mobility, firepower and protection.\n\n==== Siege machine ====\n[[File:DaVinciTankAtAmboise.jpeg|thumb|Model of a vehicle sketched by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n[[Siege engine]]s, such as [[battering ram]]s and [[siege tower]]s, would often be armoured in order to protect their crews from enemy action. [[Polyidus of Thessaly]] developed a very large movable siege tower, the ''[[helepolis]]'', as early as 340 BC, and Greek forces used such structures in the [[Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)|Siege of Rhodes]] (305 BC).\n\nThe idea of a protected fighting vehicle has been known since antiquity. Frequently cited is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s 15th-century sketch of a [[Leonardo da Vinci's fighting vehicle | mobile, protected gun-platform]]; the drawings show a conical, wooden shelter with apertures for cannons around the circumference. The machine was to be mounted on four wheels which would be turned by the crew through a system of [[Hand crank#Hand-powered cranks|hand cranks]] and [[Gear#Cage gear|cage (or \"lantern\") gears]]. Leonardo claimed: \"I will build armored wagons which will be safe and invulnerable to enemy attacks. There will be no obstacle which it cannot overcome.\"{{cn|date=September 2017}} Modern replicas have demonstrated that the human crew would have been able to move it over only short distances.\n\n==== War wagon ====\n[[Hussite]] forces in [[Bohemia]] developed [[war wagon]]s - [[Middle Ages|medieval]] weapon-platforms - around 1420 during the [[Hussite Wars]]. These heavy wagons were given protective sides with firing slits; their heavy firepower came from either a cannon or from a force of hand-gunners and crossbowmen, supported by [[infantry]] using pikes and flails. Heavy [[arquebus]]es mounted on wagons were called ''arquebus \u00e0 croc''. These carried a ball of about {{convert|3.5|oz|-1}}.<ref>{{Cyclopaedia 1728|title= ARQUEBUSS|url= http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0187&id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&isize=M |page= 342}}</ref>\n\n==== Armed and armoured car ====\n[[File:Simms Motor Scout from Autocar.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick Richard Simms|F.R.

G. Wells]] published the short story \"[[The Land Ironclads]],\" positing indomitable war machines that would bring a new age of land warfare, the way steam-powered [[ironclad warship]]s had ended the age of sail.  \n\nWells' literary vision was realized in 1916, when, amidst the pyrrhic standstill of the [[Great War]], the British [[Landships Committee]], deployed revolutionary armoured vehicles to break the stalemate.  The tank was envisioned{{by whom?|date=September 2017}} as an armoured machine that could cross ground under fire from [[machine gun]]s and reply with its own mounted machine guns and cannons.  These first [[heavy tanks|British heavy tanks of World War I]] moved on [[caterpillar track]]s that had substantially lower ground pressure than wheeled vehicles, enabling them to pass the muddy, pocked terrain and slit trenches of the [[Battle of the Somme]].\n\n==== Troop transport ====\n[[File:British Mark IX Armoured Personnel Carrier.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mark IX tank]], the first armoured personnel carrier]]\nThe tank eventually proved highly successful and, as technology improved. it became a weapon that could cross large distances at much higher speeds than supporting [[infantry]] and [[artillery]]. The need to provide the units that would fight alongside the tank led to the development of a wide range of specialised AFVs, especially during the [[Second World War]] (1939-1945).\n\nThe [[Armoured personnel carrier]], designed to transport infantry troops to the frontline, emerged towards the end of World War I. During the first actions with [[tank]]s, it had become clear that close contact with infantry was essential in order to secure ground won by the tanks. Troops on foot were vulnerable to enemy fire, but they could not be transported in the tank because of the intense heat and noxious atmosphere.{{cn|date=September 2017}} In 1917, Lieutenant G.R. Rackham was ordered to design an armoured vehicle that could fight and carry troops or supplies. The [[Mark IX tank]] was built by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong, Whitworth & Co.]], although just three vehicles had been finished at the time of the [[Armistice]] in November 1918, and only 34 were built in total.\n\n==== Tankette ====\nDifferent tank classifications emerged in the interwar period. The [[tankette]] was conceived{{by whom?|date=September 2017}} as a mobile, two-man model, mainly intended for reconnaissance. In 1925, [[Sir John Carden, 6th Baronet|Sir John Carden]] and [[Vivian Loyd]] produced the first such design \u2013 the [[Carden Loyd tankette]]. Tankettes saw use in the Italian [[Regio Esercito|Royal Army]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (1935-1936), the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-1939), and almost everywhere Italian soldiers fought during [[World War II]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] used tankettes for [[jungle warfare]].<ref name=\"T27\">\n[http://www.battlefield.ru/content/view/72/50/lang,en/ T-27 Tankette] (from the 'battlefield.ru' website, with further references cited.

Retrieved 2008-01-06.)\n</ref>\n\n==== Self-propelled artillery ====\n[[File:British Gun Carrier Mark I - 60 pdr.jpg|right|thumb|British Gun Carrier Mark I (60 pdr)]]\nThe British [[Gun Carrier Mark I]], the first [[Self-propelled artillery]], was fielded in 1917. It was based on the first [[tank]], the British [[Mark I (tank)|Mark I]], and carried a heavy field-gun. The next major advance was the [[Birch gun]] (1925), developed for the motorised warfare experimental brigade (the [[Experimental Mechanized Force]]). This mounted a field gun, capable of the usual artillery trajectories, on a tank-style chassis.\n\nDuring World War II, most major military powers developed self-propelled artillery vehicles. These had guns mounted on a tracked chassis (often that of an obsolete or superseded tank) and provided an armoured superstructure to protect the gun and its crew. The first British design, [[Bishop (artillery)|\"Bishop\"]], carried the [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25 pdr gun-howitzer]], but in a mounting that severely limited the gun's performance. It was replaced by the more effective [[Sexton (artillery)|Sexton]]. The Germans built many lightly armored self-propelled anti-tank guns using captured French equipment (for example [[Marder I]]), their own obsolete light tank chassis ([[Marder II]]), or ex-Czech chassis ([[Marder III]]). These led to better-protected tank destroyers, built on a medium-tank chassis such as the [[Jagdpanzer IV]] or the [[Jagdpanther]].\n\n==== Anti-aircraft vehicle ====\nThe [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon]] debuted in WWI. The German 88&nbsp;mm{{Citation needed|date= October 2015}} anti-aircraft gun was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks, and the British [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] was mounted on trucks for use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although the [[Birch gun]] was a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis, it was capable of elevation for anti-aircraft use. [[Vickers Armstrong]] developed one of the first SPAAGs based on the chassis of the Mk.E 6-ton light tank/Dragon Medium Mark IV tractor, mounting a Vickers QF-1 \"Pom-Pom\" gun of 40&nbsp;mm. The Germans fielded the SdKfz 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20&nbsp;mm or 37&nbsp;mm AA guns (respectively) by the start of the War.\n\n==== Self-propelled multiple rocket-launcher ====\nRocket launchers such as the Soviet [[Katyusha rocket launcher | Katyusha]] originated in the late 1930s. The [[Wehrmacht]] fielded self-propelled rocket artillery in World War II - the [[Panzerwerfer]] and [[Wurfrahmen 40]] equipped half-track armoured fighting vehicles. \n\n==== Cold War AFV ====\nBy the end of [[World War II]], most modern armies had vehicles to carry infantry, artillery and [[anti-aircraft weapon]]ry. Most modern AFVs are superficially similar in design to their World War II counterparts, but with significantly better armour, weapons, engines, electronics, and suspension. The increase in the capacity of [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] makes possible and practicable the transport of AFVs by air. Many armies are replacing some or all of their traditional heavy vehicles with lighter airmobile versions, often with wheels instead of tracks.\n\n=== Design ===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n\n==== Armour ====\n{{Main article|Aramid|Bulletproof glass|Twaron|Vehicle armour}}\nThe level of armour protection between AFVs varies greatly \u2013 a [[main battle tank]] will normally be designed to take hits from other tank guns and anti-tank [[missile#Anti-tank|missiles]], whilst light [[reconnaissance]] vehicles are often only armoured \"just in case\". Whilst heavier armour provides better protection, it makes vehicles less mobile (for a given engine power), limits its air-transportability, increases cost, uses more fuel and may limit the places it can go \u2013 for example, many bridges may be unable to support the weight of a main battle tank. A trend toward [[composite armour]] is taking the place of steel \u2013 composites are stronger for a given weight, allowing the tank to be lighter for the same protection as steel armour, or better protected for the same weight. Armour is being supplemented with [[active protection system]]s on a number of vehicles, allowing the AFV to protect itself from incoming projectiles.\n\nThe level of protection also usually varies considerably throughout the individual vehicle too, depending on the role of the vehicle and the likely direction of attack. For example, a main battle tank will usually have the heaviest armour on the hull front and the turret, lighter armour on the sides of the hull and the thinnest armour on the top and bottom of the tank. Other vehicles \u2013 such as the [[MRAP]] family \u2013 may be primarily armoured against the threat from [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and so will have heavy, [[sloped armour]] on the bottom of the hull.\n\n==== Weaponry ====\nWeaponry varies by a very wide degree between AFVs \u2013 lighter vehicles for infantry carrying, reconnaissance or specialist roles may have only a [[Cannon]] or [[Machine gun]] (or no armament at all), whereas heavy [[self propelled artillery]] will carry large guns, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] or [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]] launchers. These weapons may be mounted on a [[weapon mount#Pintle|pintle]], affixed directly to the vehicle or placed in a [[gun turret|turret]] or cupola.\n\nThe greater the recoil of the weapon on an AFV, the larger the turret ring needs to be.

More recently, gas turbines have been used. Most early AFVs used [[petrol engine]]s, as they offer a good [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, they fell out of favour during [[World War Two]] due to the flammability of the fuel.\n\nMost current AFVs are powered by a [[diesel engine]]; modern technology, including the use of [[turbocharger|turbo-charging]], helps to overcome the lower power-to-weight ratio of diesel engines compared to petrol.\n\n[[Gas turbine]] (turboshaft) engines offer a very high power-to-weight ratio and were starting to find favour in the late 20th century \u2013 however, they offer very poor fuel consumption and as such some armies are switching from gas turbines back to diesel engines (i.e. the Russian [[T-80]] used a gas turbine engine, whereas the later [[T-90]] does not). The US [[M1 Abrams]] is a notable example of a gas turbine powered tank.\n\n== Modern classification by type and role ==\nNotable armoured fighting vehicles extending from post-World War I to today.\n\n=== Tank ===\n{{Further information|Tank classification|Tank gun}}\nThe [[tank]] is an all terrain AFV designed to fill almost all battlefield roles and to engage enemy forces by the use of [[direct fire]] in the frontal assault role. Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental \"golden days\" of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main [[tank gun]] or [[artillery]] [[gun]], mounted in a fully rotating [[turret]] atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional secondary weapon systems throughout.\n\nPhilosophically, the tank is, by its very nature, an offensive weapon. Being a protective encasement with at least one gun position, it is essentially a [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]] or small [[fortress]] (though these are static fortifications of a purely defensive nature) that can move toward the enemy \u2013 hence its offensive utility. Psychologically, the tank is a [[force multiplier]] that has a positive morale effect on the infantry it accompanies.<ref name=\"morale effect\">{{cite book|title=Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia, Volume 1|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-57607-344-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&dq=%22main+battle+tank%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Stanley Sandler|accessdate=5 April 2011|page=59}}</ref> It also instills fear in the opposing force who can often hear and even feel their arrival.<ref name=\"McNab Gulf War\">{{cite book|title=Tools of violence: guns, tanks and dirty bombs|year=2008|publisher=Osprey Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7kxs__WNU8C&dq=%22Main+battle+tank%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Chris McNab, Hunter Keeter|accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Tank classifications ====\nTanks were classified either by size or by role.\n\nClassification by relative size was common, as this also tended to influence the tanks' role.\n* [[Light tank]]s are smaller tanks with thinner armour and lower-powered guns, allowing for better tactical mobility and ease of strategic transport. These are intended for armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[skirmishing]], [[artillery observer|artillery observation]], [[expeditionary warfare]] and supplementing [[Landing operation|airborne or naval landings]]. Light tanks are typically cheaper to build and maintain, but fare poorly against heavier tanks. They may be held in reserve for exploiting any breakthroughs in enemy lines, with the goal of disrupting communications and supply lines.\n* [[Medium tank]]s are mid-sized tanks with adequate armour and guns, and fair mobility, allowing for a balance of fighting abilities, mobility, cost, and transportability.\n* [[Heavy tank]]s are larger tanks with thick armour and more powerful guns, but less mobile and more difficult to transport. They were intended to be more than a match for typical enemy medium tanks, easily penetrating their armour while being much less susceptible to their attacks. Heavy tanks cost more to both build and maintain.\n\nOver time, tanks tended to be designed with heavier armour and weapons, increasing the weight of all tanks, so these classifications are relative to the average for the nation's tanks for any given period. An older tank design might be reclassified over time, such as a tank being first deployed as a medium tank, but in later years relegated to light tank roles.\n\nTanks were also classified by roles that were independent of size, such as [[cavalry tank]], [[cruiser tank]], [[BT tank|fast tank]], [[infantry tank]], [[tank destroyer]], \"assault\" tank, or \"breakthrough\" tank. Military theorists initially tended to assign tanks to traditional military infantry, cavalry, and artillery roles, but later developed more specialized roles unique to tanks.\n\nIn modern use, the heavy tank has fallen out of favour, being supplanted by more heavily armed and armoured descendant of the medium tanks \u2013 the universal [[main battle tank]]. The light tank has, in many armies, lost favour to cheaper, faster, lighter [[Armoured car (military)|armoured cars]]; however, light tanks (or similar vehicles with other names) are still in service with a number of forces as [[reconnaissance vehicle]]s, most notably the [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Russian Marines]] with the [[PT-76]], the [[British Army]] with the [[FV107 Scimitar|Scimitar]], and the [[Chinese Army]] with the [[Type 63 (tank)|Type 63]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Main battle tank ====\n[[File:T-90 Bhisma cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Indian [[T-90#India|T-90]] ''Bhisma'' <!--Bhishma?-->with appliqu\u00e9 [[reactive armor]] and standard {{convert|125|mm|in|abbr=on}} main gun]]\n{{Main article|Main battle tank|Universal tank}}\nModern [[Main battle tank#Main battle tank (late twentieth century)|main battle tanks]] or \"universal tanks\" incorporate recent advances in automotive, artillery, armour, and electronic technology to combine the best characteristics of the historic medium and heavy tanks into a single, all around type. They are also the most expensive to mass-produce. A main battle tank is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era. It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but its heavy-dependency on fuel, maintenance, and ammunition makes it [[Military logistics|logistically]] demanding. It has the heaviest [[Vehicle armour|armour]] of any AFVs on the battlefield, and carries a powerful [[precision-guided munition]] weapon systems that may be able to engage a wide variety of both ground targets and air targets. Despite significant advances in [[anti-tank warfare]], it still remains the most versatile and fearsome land-based weapon-systems of the 21st-century, valued for its [[fear|shock action]] and high [[survivability]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Tankette ====\n[[File:Wiesel120mm2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wiesel AWC|Wiesel 1A1 MK]] with {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} autocannon]]\n{{Main article|Tankette}}\nA tankette is a tracked armed and armoured vehicle<ref>''[http://www.tedescos.com/Pages/VJ/monograph2.pdf The Revolution After Next: Making Vertical Envelopment by Operationally Significant Mobile Protected Forces a Reality in the First Decade of the 21st Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213100806/http://www.tedescos.com/Pages/VJ/monograph2.pdf |date=13 February 2012 }}'', Tedesco, Vincent J.

They were very popular with smaller countries. Some saw some combat (with limited success) in [[World War II]]. However, the vulnerability of their light armour eventually caused the concept to be abandoned.\n\n==== ''Super''-heavy tank ====\n{{Main article|Super-heavy tank|Landship}}\nThe term \"super-heavy tank\" has been used to describe armoured fighting vehicles of extreme size, generally over 75 tonnes. Programs have been initiated on several occasions with the aim of creating an invincible [[siegeworks]]/[[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] vehicle for penetrating enemy formations and fortifications without fear of being destroyed in combat. Examples were designed in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] (such as the [[Panzer VIII Maus]]), along with a few in the [[Cold War]]. However, few working prototypes were built and there are no clear evidence any of these vehicles saw combat, as their immense size would have made most designs impractical.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Flame tank ====\n[[File:Churchill Crocodile 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Churchill Crocodile]] flame tank]]\n{{Main article|Flame tank}}\nA ''' flame tank''' is an otherwise-standard [[tank]] equipped with a [[flamethrower]], most commonly used to supplement [[combined arms]] attacks against [[fortification]]s, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the [[Second World War]], during which the United States, [[Soviet Union]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Italy]], Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks. Usually, the flame projector replaced one of the tank's machineguns, however, some flame projectors replaced the tank's main gun. Fuel for the flame weapon was generally carried inside the tank, although a few designs mounted the fuel externally, such as the armoured trailer used on the [[Churchill Crocodile]].\n\nFlame tanks have been superseded by [[thermobaric weapon]]s such as the Russian [[TOS-1]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Infantry tank ====\n[[File:MatildaII.jpg|thumb|A British [[Matilda II|Matilda tank]] displaying a captured Italian flag]]\n{{Main article|Infantry tank}}\nThe idea for this tank was developed during World War I by British and French. The [[infantry]] tank was designed to work in concert with infantry in the assault, moving mostly at a walking pace, and carrying heavy armour to survive defensive fire. Its main purpose was to suppress enemy fire, crush obstacles such as barbed-wire entanglements, and protect the infantry on their advance into and through enemy lines by giving mobile [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] and [[cover (military)|cover]]. The French [[Renault FT]] was the first iteration of this concept.\n\nThe British and French retained the concept between the wars and into the Second World War era. Because infantry tanks did not need to be fast, they could carry heavy armour. One of the best-known infantry tanks was the [[Matilda II]] of World War II. Other examples include the French [[Renault R35|R-35]], the British [[Valentine Tank|Valentine]], and the British [[Churchill Tank|Churchill]].\n\n==== Cruiser tank ====\n[[File:IWM-E-17616-Crusader-19421002.jpg|thumb|2 pdr-armed Crusader in the desert]]\n{{Main article|Cruiser tank}}\nA cruiser tank, or cavalry tank, was designed to move fast and exploit penetrations of the enemy front. The idea originated in \"[[Plan 1919]]\", a British plan to break the trench deadlock of [[World War I]] in part via the use of high-speed tanks. The first cruiser tank was the British [[Medium Mark A Whippet|Whippet]].\n\nBetween the wars, this concept was implemented in the \"fast tanks\" pioneered by [[J. Walter Christie]]. These led to the Soviet [[BT Tank|BT tank series]] and the British [[Cruiser tank|cruiser tank series]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], British cruiser tanks were designed to complement [[infantry tank]]s, exploiting gains made by the latter to attack and disrupt the enemy rear areas. In order to give them the required speed, cruiser designs sacrificed armour and armament compared to the infantry tanks. Pure British cruisers were generally replaced by more capable medium tanks such as the [[Sherman Tank|US Sherman]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] by 1943.\n\nThe Soviet fast tank (''bistrokhodniy tank'', or [[BT tank]]) classification also came out of the infantry/cavalry concept of armoured warfare and formed the basis for the British cruisers after 1936. The T-34 was a development of this line of tanks as well, though their armament, armour, and all-round capability places them firmly in the medium tank category.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Armoured car ===\n[[File:Elandy.png|thumb|right|[[Eland Mk7]] armoured car]]\n{{Main article|Armored car (military)}}\nThe [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]] is a wheeled, often lightly armoured, vehicle adapted as a fighting machine. Its earliest form consisted of a motorised ironside chassis fitted with firing ports. By [[World War I]], this had evolved into a mobile fortress<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nT3zle-U3jgC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=WWI+armored+cars&ots=Bk8UmvrClE&sig=2mhdnU92TvAkwwa4ILixVGIHcTE#v=onepage&q=WWI%20armored%20cars&f=false|title=1914-1938 Armored Fighting Vehicles|last=Bradford|first=George|date=2010|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811705684|language=en}}</ref> equipped with command equipment, searchlights, and machine guns for self-defence. It was soon proposed that the requirements for the armament and layout of armoured cars be somewhat similar to those on naval craft, resulting in turreted vehicles. The first example carried a single revolving cupola with a [[Vickers gun]]; modern armoured cars may boast heavier armament \u2013 ranging from twin machine guns to large calibre cannon.\n\nSome multi-axled wheeled fighting vehicles can be quite heavy, and superior to older or smaller tanks in terms of armour and armament. Others are often used in military marches and processions, or for the escorting of important figures. Under peacetime conditions, they form an essential part of most standing armies. Armoured car units can move without the assistance of transporters and cover great distances with fewer logistical problems than tracked vehicles.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], armoured cars were used for reconnaissance alongside scout cars. Their guns were suitable for some defence if they encountered enemy [[armoured vehicles]], but they were not intended to engage enemy [[tanks]]. [[Armored car (military)|Armoured cars]] have since been used in the offensive role against tanks with varying degrees of success, most notably during the [[South African Border War]], [[Toyota War]], the [[Invasion of Kuwait]], and other [[Low intensity conflict|lower-intensity conflicts]].\n\n==== Aerosani ====\n{{Main article|Aerosani}}\nAn ''aerosani'' ({{lang-ru |a\u044d\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438}}, literally \"aerosled\") is a type of propeller-driven [[snowmobile]], running on skis, used for communications, mail deliveries, medical aid, emergency recovery and border patrolling in northern [[Russia]], as well as for recreation. Aerosanis were used by the Soviet [[Red Army]] during the [[Winter War]] and [[World War II]].\n\nThe first aerosanis may have been built by young [[Igor Sikorsky]] in 1909\u201310, before he built multi-engine airplanes and helicopters. They were very light [[plywood]] vehicles on skis, propelled by old airplane engines and propellers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/propsleigh/propsleigh.htm |title=The Propeller-Driven Sleigh |publisher=SelfSite |date=26 July 2005 |accessdate=11 September 2008}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Scout car ====\n{{Main article|Scout car}}\nA '''scout car''' is a military armored [[reconnaissance vehicle]], capable of off-road mobility and often carrying mounted weapons such as [[machine gun]]s for offensive capabilities and crew protection. They often only carry an operational crew aboard, which differentiates them from wheeled [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs) and [[Infantry Mobility Vehicle]]s (IMVs), but early scout cars, such as the open-topped US [[M3 Scout Car]] could carry a crew of seven. The term is often used synonymously with the more general term [[Armored car (military)|armored car]], which also includes armored civilian vehicles. They are also differentiated by being designed and built for purpose, as opposed to improvised [[Technical (vehicle)|\"technicals\"]] which might serve in the same role.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Reconnaissance vehicle ====\n[[File:Stryker RV front q.jpg|thumb|[[United States Army]] [[M1127 Reconnaissance Vehicle]]]]\n{{Main article|Reconnaissance vehicle}}\n\nA '''reconnaissance vehicle''', also known as a '''scout vehicle''', is a [[military vehicle]] used for forward [[reconnaissance]]. Both tracked and wheeled reconnaissance vehicles are in service. In some nations, light tanks such as the [[M551 Sheridan]] and [[AMX-13]] are also used by scout platoons. Reconnaissance vehicles are usually designed with a low profile or small size and are lightly armoured, relying on speed and cover to escape detection. Their armament ranges from a medium machine gun to a large cannon. Modern examples are often fitted with [[ATGM]]s and a wide range of sensors.\n\nSome [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[infantry mobility vehicle]], such as the [[M113]], [[TPz Fuchs]], and [[Cadillac Gage Commando]] double in the reconnaissance role.\n\n==== Internal security vehicle ====\n{{Main article|Internal security vehicle}}\nAn internal security vehicle (ISV), also known as an armoured security vehicle (ASV), is a combat vehicle used for supporting contingency operations. Security vehicles are typically armed with a turreted [[heavy machine gun]] and auxiliary [[medium machine gun]]. The vehicle is designed to minimize firepower dead space and the vehicles weapons can be depressed to a maximum of 12\u00b0. [[Non-lethal weapon|Non-lethal]] [[water cannon]]s and [[tear gas]] cannons can provide suppressive fire in lieu of unnecessary deadly fire.<ref name=\"Brassey's2\">{{cite book|title=Brassey's Encyclopedia of Land Forces and Warfare|year=1996|publisher=Brassey's|isbn=1-57488-087-X|pages=56, 57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ipz0AzERg_MC&vq=isbn&dq=%22internal+security+vehicle%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Franklin D. Margiotta|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe vehicle must be protected against weapons typical of riots. Protection from [[incendiary device]]s is achieved though coverage of the air intake and exhaust ports as well as a strong locking mechanism on the fuel opening. Turret and door locks prevent access to the interior of the vehicle by rioters. Vision blocks, ballistic glass and window shutters and outside [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance cameras]] allow protected observation from within the vehicle. Wheeled 4x4 and 6x6 configurations are typical of security vehicles. Tracked security vehicles are often cumbersome and leave negative political connotations for being perceived as an imperial invading force.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Improvised fighting vehicle ====\n{{Main article|Improvised vehicle armour|Improvised fighting vehicle|Gun truck|Technical (vehicle)}}\nAn improvised fighting vehicle is a combat vehicle resulting from modifications to a civilian or military non-combat vehicle in order to give it a fighting capability. Such modifications usually consist of the grafting of [[Vehicle armour|armour plating]] and [[weapon systems]]. Various militaries have procured such vehicles, ever since the introduction of the first [[automobile]]s into military service.\n\nDuring the early days, the absence of a doctrine for the military use of automobiles or of an industry dedicated to producing them, lead to much improvisation in the creation of early [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], and other such vehicles. Later, despite the advent of [[arms industry|arms industries]] in many countries, several armies still resorted to using ad hoc contraptions, often in response to unexpected military situations, or as a result of the development of new [[Military tactics|tactics]] for which no available vehicle was suitable. The construction of improvised fighting vehicles may also reflect a lack of means for the force that uses them. This is especially true in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where various armies and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces have used them, as they are more affordable than military-grade combat vehicles.\n\nModern examples include '''military gun truck''' used by units of regular armies or other official government armed forces, based on a conventional cargo [[truck]], that is able to carry a large weight of weapons and armour. They have mainly been used by regular armies to escort military convoys in regions subject to ambush by [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces. \"[[Narco tank]]s\", used by [[Mexico|Mexican]] drug cartels in the [[Mexican Drug War]], are built from such trucks, which combines [[operational mobility]], [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], and [[defense (military)|defensive]] capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13488620|title=Mexico police seize 'narco-tank'|date=22 May 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2011/05/narco-tank-vehicles-cartels-drug-war-mexico.html|title='Narco tank' is latest find in cartels' armored vehicles|date=25 May 2011|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110606/wl_afp/mexicocrimedrugweapons |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112125/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110606/wl_afp/mexicocrimedrugweapons |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/01/18/mexican-cartels-moving-drugs-in-armored-vehicles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119210304/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/01/18/mexican-cartels-moving-drugs-in-armored-vehicles/ |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Humvee in difficult terrain.jpg| A [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Humvee|High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle]] traversing difficult terrain in [[Khost Province]], Afghanistan\nFile:Gun Truck.jpg|A [[Gun Truck]] of the type used in Iraq, based on an [[M939 Truck|M939]] five-ton truck\nFile:Ali Hassan al-Jaber Brigade.jpg|A [[ZU-23-2]] [[Technical (vehicle)|technical]] used by the forces of the [[National Transitional Council]] during the Libyan civil war, in October 2011\n</gallery>\n\n=== Troop carriers ===\nTroop-carrying AFVs are divided into three main types \u2013 armoured personnel carriers (APCs), infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and infantry mobility vehicles (IMV). The main difference between the three is their intended role \u2013 the APC is designed purely to transport troops and is armed for self-defense only \u2013 whereas the IFV is designed to provide close-quarters and anti-armour fire support to the infantry it carries. IMV is a wheeled armored personnel carrier serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle.\n\n==== Armoured personnel carrier ====\n[[File:Slovakia army 868.jpg|thumb|right|Slovak APC [[Tatrapan]]]]\n{{Main article|Armoured personnel carrier}}\n'''[[Armoured personnel carrier]]s''' ('''APCs''') are intended to carry infantry quickly and relatively safely to the point where they are deployed.

In 1944, the Canadian general [[Guy Simonds]] ordered the conversion of redundant armoured vehicles to carry troops (generically named \"[[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroos]]\"). This proved highly successful, even without training, and the concept was widely used in the [[21st Army Group]]. Post-war, specialised designs were built, such as the Soviet [[BTR-60]] and US [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Infantry fighting vehicle ====\n{{Main article|Infantry fighting vehicle}}\nAn '''infantry fighting vehicle''' ('''IFV'''), also known as a '''mechanized infantry combat vehicle''' ('''MICV'''), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry [[infantry]] into battle and provide [[Direct fire|direct]] [[fire support]].<ref name=McNab>{{cite book|title=Combat Techniques: An Elite Forces Guide to Modern Infantry Tactics|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36824-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3YaVQR7x5QC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Martin J.

They are differentiated from APCs\u2014 which are purely \"troop-transport\" vehicles armed only for self-defense\u2014 because they are designed to give direct fire support to the dismounted infantry and so usually have significantly enhanced armament. IFVs also often have improved [[vehicle armour|armour]] and some have firing ports (allowing the infantry to fire [[firearm|personal weapons]] while mounted).\n\nThey are typically armed with an [[autocannon]] of 20 to 40&nbsp;mm calibre, 7.62mm machine guns, [[anti-tank missile]]s (ATGMs) and/or [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs). IFVs are usually [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category. IFVs are generally less heavily armed and armoured than [[main battle tank]]s. They sometimes carry [[anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] missiles to protect and support infantry against armoured threats, such as the NATO [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missile and Soviet [[9M117 Bastion|Bastion]], which offer a significant threat to tanks. Specially equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Infantry mobility vehicle ====\n[[File:AMZ Tur PICT0096.jpg|thumb|Polish [[AMZ Tur]]]]\n{{Main article|Infantry mobility vehicle|MRAP}}\nAn '''infantry mobility vehicle''' ('''IMV''') or '''protected patrol vehicle''' ('''PPV''') is a wheeled [[armored personnel carrier]] (APC) serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle. Examples include the [[ATF Dingo]], [[AMZ Dzik]], [[AMZ Tur]], [[Mungo ESK]], and [[Bushmaster IMV]]. This term also applies to the vehicles currently being fielded as part of the [[MRAP]] program.\n\nIMVs were developed in response to the threats of modern counter insurgency warfare, with an emphasis on [[Ambush]] Protection and [[Improvised Explosive Device|Mine]]-Resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French [[V\u00e9hicule de l'Avant Blind\u00e9|VAB]] and South African [[Buffel]]. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. It is a [[neologism]] for what might have been classified in the past as an armoured [[scout car]], such as the [[BRDM]], but the IMV is distinguished by having a requirement to carry dismountable infantry. The up-armoured [[M1114]] Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nCV9035 assessment (cropped).jpg|A [[Combat Vehicle 90|CV-9035]] Swedish infantry fighting vehicle used by U.S. Army.\nM113IraqiFreedom.jpg|The [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]], one of the most common tracked APCs, on duty during the [[Iraq War]]\nDingo 2.jpg|The [[ATF Dingo]] of the [[German Army]] is a mine-resistant/ambush protected infantry mobility vehicle used by several European armed forces\nFile:278th MP Company's new ASVs.jpg|United States [[Army National Guard]] [[M1117 Armored Security Vehicle]]s\n</gallery>\n\n=== Amphibious vehicles ===\n[[File:BTR-80 coming ashore.jpg|thumb|right|BTR-80s coming ashore, engine snorkels and waterjet deployed]]\n[[File:AAV-australia.jpg|thumb|right|Two U.S. Marine Corps [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle]]s emerge from the surf onto the sand of [[Freshwater Beach]], Australia]]\n{{Main article|Amphibious vehicle#Armored|Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault|Landing craft}}\nMany modern military vehicles, ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance, through [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[tank]]s, are manufactured with amphibious capabilities. Contemporary wheeled armoured amphibians include the French [[V\u00e9hicule de l'Avant Blind\u00e9]] and [[V\u00e9hicule Blind\u00e9 L\u00e9ger]]. The latter is a small, lightly armoured [[4x4]] all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at 5.4&nbsp;km/h. The VAB (''V\u00e9hicule de l'Avant Blind\u00e9'' - \"Armoured Vanguard Vehicle\") is a fully amphibious [[armoured personnel carrier]] powered in the water by two water jets, that entered service in 1976 and produced in numerous configurations, ranging from basic personnel carrier, anti-tank missile platform.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] the [[Soviet bloc]] states developed a number of amphibious APCs, fighting vehicles and tanks, both wheeled and tracked. Most of the vehicles the Soviets designed were amphibious, or could ford deep water. Wheeled examples are the [[BRDM-1]] and [[BRDM-2]] [[4x4]] armoured scout cars, as well as the [[BTR-60]], [[BTR-70]], [[BTR-80]] and [[BTR-94]] [[8x8]] armoured personnel carriers and the [[BTR-90]] infantry fighting vehicle.\n\nThe United States started developing a long line of [[Landing Vehicle Tracked]] (LVT) designs from ca. 1940. The US Marine Corps currently uses the AAV7-A1 [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle]], which was to be succeeded by the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], which was capable of planing on water and can achieve water speeds of 37\u201346&nbsp;km/h. The EFV project has been cancelled.\n\nA significant amount of tracked armoured vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use, have some amphibious cability, tactically useful inland, reducing dependence on bridges. They use their tracks, sometimes with added propeller or water jets for propulsion. As long as the banks have a shallow enough slopes to enter or leave the water they can cross rivers and water obstacles.\n\nSome heavy tanks can operate amphibiously with a fabric skirt to add [[buoyancy]]. The [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] [[DD tank]] used in the [[Normandy landings]] had this setup. When in water the waterproof float screen was raised and propellers deployed. Some modern vehicles use a similar skirt.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Armoured engineering vehicle ===\n[[File:IDF Puma CEV (5).jpg|thumb|[[IDF Puma]] combat engineering vehicle]]\n{{Main article|Military engineering vehicle}}\nModern engineering AFV's utilize chassis based on main battle tank platforms: these vehicles are as well armoured and protected as tanks, designed to keep up tanks, conduct obstacle breaching operations to help tanks get to wherever it needs to be, perform utility functions necessary to expedite mission objectives of tanks, and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. These vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the United States the term \"combat engineer vehicle (CEV)\" is used, in the United Kingdom the term \"[[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVRE)\" is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term \"armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)\" is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes, or lifting booms.\n\nAlthough the term \"armoured engineer vehicle\" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank-based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank-based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces. Thus, \"armoured engineer vehicle\" used generically would refer to AEV, AVLB, Assault Breachers, and so on. Good examples of this type of vehicle include the UK [[Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|Trojan AVRE]], the Russian IMR, and the US [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Assault breacher vehicle ====\n{{Main article|Assault Breacher Vehicle}}\nAn '''assault breacher vehicle (ABV)''', also known as a '''explosive ordnance disposal vehicle (EODV)''', or simply '''Breacher''', is especially designed to clear pathways for troops and other vehicles through [[minefields]] and along [[roadside bomb]]s and [[Improvised Explosive Device]]s. These vehicles are based on a tank-chassis with 1,500+ horsepower engines, but fitted with a 50-caliber machine gun and a front-mounted 5-meter-wide plow, supported by metallic skis that glide on the dirt and typically equipped with at least {{convert|7,000|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of [[Mine Clearing Line Charge]]s: rockets carrying [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] explosives up to 100\u2013150 meters forward, detonating hidden bombs at a safe distance, so that troops and vehicles can pass through safely.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021101755.html|title=\"Marines push 'The Breacher' against Taliban lines\"|publisher=}}</ref> They were called ''\"the answer\"'' to the deadliest threat facing NATO troops in modern asymmetrical conflict.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Armoured bulldozer ====\n[[File:IDF-D9-Zachi-Evenor-001.jpg|thumb|[[IDF Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]]]]\n{{Main article|Armored bulldozer}}\nThe '''armored [[bulldozer]]''' is a basic tool of [[combat engineering]]. These [[combat engineering vehicle]]s combine the earth moving capabilities of the bulldozer with armor which protects the vehicle and its operator in or near combat. Most are civilian bulldozers modified by addition of [[vehicle armor]]/military equipment, but some are [[tank]]s stripped of armament and fitted with a dozer blade. Some tanks have bulldozer blades while retaining their armament, but this does not make them armored bulldozers as such, because combat remains the primary role \u2013 earth moving is a secondary task.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Armoured recovery vehicle ====\n{{Main article|Armoured recovery vehicle}}\nAn '''armoured recovery vehicle''' ('''ARV''') is a type of [[Vehicle recovery (military)|vehicle recovery]] armoured fighting vehicle used to repair battle- or mine-damaged as well as broken-down armoured vehicles during combat, or to tow them out of the danger zone for more extensive repairs. To this end the term ''\"Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle\" (ARRV)'' is also used.\n\nARVs are normally built on the [[chassis]] of a [[main battle tank]] (MBT), but some are also constructed on the basis of other armoured fighting vehicles, mostly [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs). ARVs are usually built on the basis of a vehicle in the same class as they are supposed to recover; a tank-based ARV is used to recover tanks, while an APC-based one recovers APCs, but does not have the power to tow a much heavier tank.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Armoured vehicle-launched bridge ====\n{{Main article|Armoured vehicle-launched bridge}}\nAn '''armoured vehicle-launched bridge''' ('''AVLB''') is a combat support vehicle, sometimes regarded as a subtype of [[combat engineering vehicle]], designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying [[tank]]s and other armoured fighting vehicles across rivers. The AVLB is usually a tracked vehicle converted from a tank chassis to carry a folding metal bridge instead of weapons. The AVLB's job is to allow armoured or infantry units to cross water, when a river too deep for vehicles to wade through is reached, and no bridge is conveniently located (or sufficiently sturdy, a substantial concern when moving 60-ton tanks).\n\nThe bridge layer unfolds and launches its cargo, providing a ready-made bridge across the obstacle in only minutes. Once the span has been put in place, the AVLB vehicle detaches from the bridge, and moves aside to allow traffic to pass. Once all of the vehicles have crossed, it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side. It then retracts the span ready to move off again. A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions. AVLBs can carry bridges of {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} or greater in length. By using a tank chassis, the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as [[main battle tank]]s, and the provision of armour allows them to operate even in the face of enemy fire. However, this is not a universal attribute: some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Combat engineer section carriers ====\nThe '''combat engineer section carriers''' are used to transport [[sapper]]s ([[combat engineer]]s) and can be fitted with a [[bulldozer]]'s blade and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with [[machine gun]]s and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to push blades and rakes. Some examples are the U.S. [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 APC]], [[IDF Puma]], [[Nagmachon]], Husky, and U.S. [[M1132 Engineer Support Vehicle|M1132 ESV]] (a [[Stryker]] variant).\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:IDF Puma CEV (5).jpg|[[IDF Puma]] - combat engineering vehicle and section carrier\nFile:M60-panther-mcgovern-base.jpg|A remotely controlled Panther armored mine clearing vehicle leads a column down a road in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], 16 May 1996.\nFile:M1 Assault Breacher Vehicle.jpg|Marines with 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion launch a [[M58 MICLIC]] from an Assault Breacher Vehicle\nFile:D9--Our-IDF-2018-IZE-211.jpg|An armored [[IDF Caterpillar D9]]R [[bulldozer]], nicknamed \"\u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\" ([[Teddy bear]]) in [[Israel]].

The Russian equivalent of SPAAG is ZSU (from ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka'' \u2013 \"anti-aircraft self-propelled mount\"). Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, larger guns, or missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles, such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment. Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Self-propelled artillery ===\n{{Main article|Self-propelled artillery|Self-propelled gun}}\nSelf-propelled [[artillery]] vehicles give mobility to [[artillery]]. Within the term are covered [[self-propelled gun]]s (or [[howitzer]]s) and [[rocket artillery]]. They are highly mobile, usually based on tracked chassis carrying either a large howitzer or other field gun or alternatively a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range [[indirect-fire|indirect]] bombardment support on the battlefield.\n\nIn the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct-fire \"Gun Motor Carriage\" vehicles, such as [[assault gun]]s and [[tank destroyer]]s (also known as self-propelled anti-tank guns). These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing danger-close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles.\n\nModern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble tanks, but they are generally lightly armoured, too lightly to survive in direct-fire combat. However, they protect their crews against [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and small arms and are therefore usually included as armoured fighting vehicles. Many are equipped with [[machine gun]]s for defence against enemy infantry.\n\nThe key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and the guns set up. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought \u2014 usually towed \u2014 to the new location. By comparison, self-propelled artillery in combination with modern communications, can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.\n\nConversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach, so despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the [[arsenal]]s of many modern armies.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Assault gun ====\n[[File:Su76 nn.jpg|thumb|The Soviet [[SU-76]] was easily constructed in small factories incapable of producing proper tanks]]\n{{Main article|Assault gun}}\nAn assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armoured chassis, designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other infantry or [[fortified]] positions.\n\nHistorically, the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed [[casemate]] on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a [[gun turret]] limited these weapons' [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armour to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Mortar carrier ====\n[[File:Stryker MCV-B.jpg|thumb|An American [[M1129 Mortar Carrier]]]]\n{{Main article|Mortar carrier}}\nA mortar carrier is a [[self-propelled artillery]] vehicle carrying a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] as its primary weapon. Mortar carriers cannot be fired while on the move and some must be dismounted to fire. In U.S. Army doctrine, mortar carriers provide close and immediate indirect fire support for maneuver units while allowing for rapid displacement and quick reaction to the tactical situation. The ability to relocate not only allows fire support to be provided where it is needed faster, but also allows these units to avoid [[counter-battery fire]]. Mortar carriers have traditionally avoided direct contact with the enemy. Many units report never using secondary weapons in combat.\n\nPrior to the [[Iraq War]], American 120&nbsp;mm mortar platoons reorganized from six [[M1064 mortar carrier]]s and two M577 fire direction centers (FDC) to four M1064 and one FDC.<ref>https://www.knox.army.mil/center/armormag/currentissues/2006/ja06/4ward06c.pdfMortar{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=Redalert2fan |fix-attempted=yes }} Platoon Training Focus to Meet the Evolving Battlefield</ref> The urban environment of Iraq made it difficult to utilize mortars. New technologies such as mortar ballistic computers and communication equipment and are being integrated. Modern era combat is becoming more reliant on [[direct fire]] support from mortar carrier [[machine gun]]s.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Multiple rocket launcher ====\n[[File:9a52 smerch.jpg|thumb|right|[[BM-30 Smerch]] 300&nbsp;mm rocket launcher in raised position]]\n{{Main article|Multiple rocket launcher}}\nA multiple rocket launcher is a type of unguided [[rocket artillery]] system. Like other [[rocket]] artillery, multiple rocket launchers are less accurate and have a much lower (sustained) rate of fire than batteries of traditional [[artillery]] guns. However, they have the capability of simultaneously dropping many hundreds of kilograms of explosive, with devastating effect.\n\nThe Korean [[Hwacha]] is an example of an early weapon system with a resemblance to the modern-day multiple rocket launcher.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The first modern multiple rocket launcher was the German ''[[Nebelwerfer]]'' of the 1930s, a small towed artillery piece. Only later in [[World War II]] did the Allies deploy similar weapons in the form of the [[Mattress (rocket)|Land Mattress]].\n\nThe first self-propelled multiple rocket launchers \u2013 and arguably the most famous \u2013 were the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Katyusha rocket launcher|BM-13 Katyushas]], first used during World War II and exported to Soviet allies afterwards. They were simple systems in which a rack of launch rails was mounted on the back of a truck. This set the template for modern multiple rocket launchers. The Americans mounted tubular launchers atop [[M4 Sherman]] tanks to create the [[T34 Calliope]] rocket launching tank, only used in small numbers, as their closest equivalent to the Katyusha.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Tank destroyer ====\n[[File:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|right|A Norwegian anti-tank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]\n{{Main article|Tank destroyer|Anti-tank warfare}}\nTank destroyers and tank hunters are armed with an [[anti-tank gun]] or missile launcher, and are designed specifically to engage enemy armoured vehicles. Many have been based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled. Since World War II, main battle tanks have largely replaced gun-armed tank destroyers; although lightly armoured anti tank guided missile (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank engagements.\n\nIn post-[[Cold War]] conflict, the resurgence of [[expeditionary warfare]] has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called \"protected gun systems\", which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low intensity operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. These have the advantage of easier deployment, as only the largest air transports can carry a main battle tank, and their smaller size makes them more effective in urban combat.\n\nMany forces' IFVs carry anti-tank missiles in every infantry platoon, and attack helicopters have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, or intended for airborne use. There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary armoured personnel carrier or armoured car chassis. Examples include the U.S. M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) and the Norwegian NM142, both on an [[M113]] chassis, several Soviet ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM-2|BRDM reconnaissance car]], the British FV438 [[Swingfire]] and [[FV102 Striker]] and the German Raketenjagdpanzer series built on the chassis of the HS 30 and Marder IFV.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:AS-90 self-propelled artillery.JPG|British [[AS-90]]s firing in [[Basra]], Iraq, 2006\nFile:Sherman Tank WW2.jpg|A preserved Sherman M4(105) Assault Gun carriage\nFile:\u0422\u041e\u0421-1\u0410 \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 4.5.2010.jpg|\u0422\u041eS-1A \u2013 Russian 24-barrel multiple rocket launcher\n</gallery>\n\n=== Armoured train ===\n[[File:Pancierovy vlak-Zvolen.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the [[Armored train Hurban|'Hurban' Armoured train]] located in Zvolen, Slovakia]]\n{{Main article|Armoured train}}\nAn '''armoured train''' is a railway train protected with [[vehicle armour|armour]]. They are usually equipped with railroad cars armed with [[artillery]] and [[machine gun]]s. They were mostly used during the late 19th and early 20th century, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of firepower. Their use was discontinued in most countries when road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and because armoured trains were too vulnerable to track sabotage as well as attacks from the air. However, the [[Russia]]n Federation used improvised armoured trains in the [[Second Chechen War]] in the late 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe railroad cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks, such as carrying guns and machine guns, infantry units, anti-aircraft guns. During World War II, the Germans would sometimes put a ''Fremdger\u00e4t'' (such as a captured French [[Somua S-35]] or Czech [[PzKpfw 38(t)]] light tank, or [[Panzer II]] light tank) on a flatbed car, which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy [[Partisan (military)|partisans]].\n\nDifferent types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.\n\nArmoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a [[draisine]]. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley, which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm [[MG-13|MG13]] machine gun turrets from [[Panzer I]] light tanks.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|tank}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Lists of armoured fighting vehicles]]\n* [[Aerosan]]\n* [[Armored car (military)|Armoured car (military)]]\n* [[Armoured train]]\n* [[Armoured recovery vehicle]] (ARV)\n* [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge]] (AVLB)\n* [[Armoured warfare]]\n* [[Combat engineering vehicle]]\n* [[Non-military armored vehicles|Non-military armoured vehicles]]\n* [[Self-propelled artillery]]\n* [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft]]\n* [[Tachanka]]\n* [[Tank classification]]\n* [[Tank destroyer]]\n* [[Technical (vehicle)]]\n* [[Vehicle markings of the United States military]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Armored fighting vehicles}}\n* [http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/ US Wheeled armoured fighting vehicles]\n\n{{WWI tanks|style=wide}}\n{{Interwar tanks|style=wide}}\n{{WWII tanks|style=wide}}\n{{Cold War tanks|style=wide}}\n{{Post-Cold War tanks|style=wide}}\n\n[[Category:Military vehicles by type]]\n[[Category:Armoured fighting vehicles|*]]", "sha1": "el73a9u7iomyxwx3028jmphj45u7gwm"}}, {"title": "Armor", "ns": "0", "id": "2149", "redirect": {"title": "Armour"}, "revision": {"id": "783846303", "parentid": "516887537", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T01:18:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Armour]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative spelling}}\n}}", "sha1": "8jnqlyyaitopumt97qq0zzntbgtsi5b"}}, {"title": "Anton Drexler", "ns": "0", "id": "2151", "revision": {"id": "864787665", "parentid": "864787498", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T13:17:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kierzek", "id": "9088688"}, "minor": "", "comment": "ce", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox Politician\n| name         = Anton Drexler\n| image        = Anton_Drexler.jpg\n| alt          = Monochrome photograph of the upper body of a bespectacled Anton Drexler\n| imagesize    =\n| office2      = [[German Workers' Party|Chairman of the German Workers' Party]]\n| term_start2  = 5 January 1919\n| term_end2    = 24 February 1920\n| deputy2      = [[Karl Harrer]]\n| successor2   = ''Position abolished''\n| predecessor2 = ''Position established''\n| office1      = [[Nazi Party|Leader of the Nazi Party]]\n| term_start1  = 24 February 1920\n| term_end1    = 29 June 1921\n| deputy1      =\n| successor1   = [[Adolf Hitler]]\n| predecessor1 = ''Position established''\n| birth_date   = {{Birth date|1884|6|13|df=y}}\n| birth_place  = [[Munich]], [[German Empire]]\n| death_date   = {{death date and age|1942|2|24|1884|6|13|df=y}}\n| death_place  = Munich, [[Nazi Germany]]\n| birthname    = \n| nationality  = [[Germany|German]]\n| party        = [[German Fatherland Party]] <small>(1917\u201318)</small><br />[[German Workers' Party]] <small>(1919\u201320)</small><br />[[Nazi Party]] <small>(1920\u201342)</small>\n| spouse       = \n| residence    = \n| alma_mater   = \n| occupation   = [[Politician]]\n| awards       = [[Blood Order]]</small><br />[[Golden Party Badge]]\n| religion     = \n| signature    = \n| website      = \n}}\n'''Anton Drexler''' (13 June 1884 \u2013 24 February 1942) was a [[German people|German]] [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political leader of the 1920s who founded the [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), the antecedent of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).

It was in this speech that Hitler, for the first time, enunciated the [[National Socialist Program#German Party program|twenty-five points of the ''German Worker's Party'''s manifesto]] that he had authored with Drexler and Feder.<ref>Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 37</ref> Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem<ref>Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 89</ref> with a clear foreign policy, including the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a [[German Question|Greater Germany]], Eastern expansion, exclusion of Jews from citizenship. On the same day the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''; NSDAP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}} The significance of this particular move in publicity moved Karl Harrer to resign from the party in disagreement.<ref>Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 36</ref>\n\nFollowing an intraparty dispute, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation on 11 July 1921. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101, 102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed; he rejoined the party as member 3,680. Drexler was thereafter moved to the purely symbolic position of honorary president and left the party in 1923.<ref>Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 41</ref>\n\nDrexler was also a member of a ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|v\u00f6lkisch]]'' political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the [[Thule Society]]. His membership in the Nazi Party ended when the club was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] despite Drexler not actually having taken part in the coup attempt. In 1924 he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for another party, in which he served as vice president until 1928. He played no role in the Nazi Party's re-founding in 1925 and rejoined only after Hitler ascended to national power in 1933.{{sfn|Hamilton|1984|p=220}} He founded a splinter group, the ''Nationalsozialer Volksbund'', but this dissolved in 1928.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=209}} He received the party's [[Blood Order]] in 1934 and was still occasionally used as a [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] tool until about 1937, but he was never allowed any legitimate power in the party.\n\n==Death==\nDrexler died in Munich in February 1942.{{sfn|Hamilton|1984|p=220}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these soldiers upon returning home from the front.\n\nThe novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'' (1930), were among the books banned and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Eksteins\n  | first = Modris\n  | title = All Quiet on the Western Front and the Fate of a War\n  | journal = Journal of Contemporary History\n  | volume = 15\n  | issue = 2\n  | page = 353\n  | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]]\n  | date = April 1980\n  | doi = 10.1177/002200948001500207 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the book was adapted as an Academy-Award-winning [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. It was adapted again in 1979 by [[Delbert Mann]], this time as [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|a television film]] starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]].\n\n==Title and translation==\nThe English translation by [[Arthur Wesley Wheen]] gives the title as '' All Quiet on the Western Front''. The literal translation of \"Im Westen nichts Neues\" is \"In the West Nothing New,\" with \"West\" being the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the novel.\n\n[[Brian O Murdoch|Brian Murdoch's]] 1993 translation would render the phrase as \"there was nothing new to report on the Western Front\" within the narrative. Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:\n\n<blockquote>\nAlthough it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe phrase \"all quiet on the Western Front\" has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/all+quiet+on+the+Western+Front|title=all quiet on the Western Front|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe book tells the story of Paul B\u00e4umer who belongs to a group of German soldiers on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. The patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek had led the whole class to volunteer for military service shortly after the start of [[World War I]]. His class was \"scattered over the platoons amongst [[Frisians|Frisian]] fishermen, peasants, and labourers.\" B\u00e4umer arrives at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with his friends and schoolmates (Leer, M\u00fcller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, B\u00e4umer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, Remarque writes, \"This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war.\"<ref name=\"DestroyedByWar\" /> The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of [[artillery]] fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail. They had been forced into the army.\n\nThe battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for B\u00e4umer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. \"We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces.\"\n\nPaul's visit on leave to his home highlight the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does \"not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world.\"  He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him \"stupid and distressing\" questions about his war experiences, not understanding \"that a man cannot talk of such things.\"  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their \"own little sector\" of the war but nothing of the big picture.\n\nIndeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, \"Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you?  Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it.\"  In the end, he concludes that he \"ought never to have come [home] on leave.\"\n\nPaul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.\nThey are then sent on what Paul calls a \"good job.\" They must guard a supply depot in a village that was evacuated due to being shelled too heavily. During this time, the men are able to adequately feed themselves, unlike the near-starvation conditions in the German trenches. In addition, the men enjoy themselves while living off the spoils from the village and officers' luxuries from the supply depot (such as fine cigars). While evacuating the villagers (enemy civilians), Paul and Albert are taken by surprise by artillery fired at the civilian convoy and wounded by a shell. On the train back home, Albert takes a turn for the worse and cannot complete the journey, instead being sent off the train to recuperate in a Catholic hospital.\nPaul uses a combination of bartering and manipulation to stay by Albert's side. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, while Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.\n\nBy now, the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims or goals left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.\n\nIn October 1918, Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: \"All quiet on the Western Front.\" Paul's corpse displays a calm expression on its face, \"as though almost glad the end had come.\"\n\n==Themes==\nOne of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that \"[This book] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.\"<ref name=\"DestroyedByWar\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYPUw18AC&pg=PA48&dq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}</ref> This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. In addition, the massive loss of life and negligible gains from the fighting are constantly emphasized. Soldiers' lives are thrown away by their commanding officers who are stationed comfortably away from the front, ignorant of the daily terrors of the front line.\n\n==Main characters==\n[[Image:AllQuietOnTheWesternFront.jpg|thumb|Cover of first English language edition. The design is based upon a German [[war bonds]] poster by [[Fritz Erler (painter)|Fritz Erler]].]]\n\n===Albert Kropp===\nKropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a [[leg amputation]]. Both he and B\u00e4umer end up spending time in a [[Catholic]] hospital together, B\u00e4umer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit [[suicide]] if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie. Kropp and B\u00e4umer part ways when B\u00e4umer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was \"very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with.\"<ref>Chapter Ten of All Quiet on the Western Front</ref>\n\n===Haie Westhus===\nHaie is described as being tall and strong, and a [[peat]]-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie, in addition, has a good sense of humor. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6)\u2014the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelsto\u00df (Himmelstoss) carries him to safety.\n\n===Fredrich M\u00fcller===\nM\u00fcller is about 18 and a half years of age, one of B\u00e4umer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he \"mutters propositions in physics\". He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel. He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a \"light pistol\" (flare gun). As he was dying \"quite conscious and in terrible pain\", he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.\n\n===Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katczinsky===\nKat has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler ([[shoemaker]]) in civilian life; he is older than Paul B\u00e4umer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, B\u00e4umer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.\n\nKat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, especially food. At one point he secures four boxes of lobster. B\u00e4umer describes Kat as possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]. One night, B\u00e4umer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.\n\nKat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes B\u00e4umer indifferent as to whether he survives the war or not, yet certain that he can face the rest of his life without fear. \"Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear.\"\n\n=== Tjaden ===\nOne of B\u00e4umer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelsto\u00df (thanks to his strict \"disciplinary actions\"), he manages to forgive Himmelsto\u00df later in the book. Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as \"thin as a rake\". He appears in the sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]''.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Kantorek===\nKantorek was the [[schoolmaster]] of Paul and his friends, including  Kropp, Leer, M\u00fcller, and Behm. Behaving \"in a way that cost [him] nothing,\" Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages B\u00e4umer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war.\n\nKantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be drilled and taunted by Mittelst\u00e4dt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.\n\n===Peter Leer===\nLeer is an intelligent soldier in B\u00e4umer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. B\u00e4umer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying \"Leer is an old hand at the game\". In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, \"What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?\"<ref>''All Quiet on the Western Front'' (London: Putnam & Company Ltd, 1970 reprint), p. 240.</ref>\n\n===Bertinck===\nLieutenant Bertinck is the leader of B\u00e4umer's [[Company (military)|company]]. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. He permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who would only allow them their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement.\n\nWhen he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hit by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.\n\n===Himmelstoss===\nCorporal Himmelstoss (spelled Himmelsto\u00df in some editions) was a postman before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment. Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them \"hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough\" but most importantly it taught them comradeship. However, B\u00e4umer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front.\n\nHimmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul B\u00e4umer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to B\u00e4umer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelsto\u00df later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for B\u00e4umer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.\n\n===Detering===\nDetering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, \"It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war,\" when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of their misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.\n\n===Josef Hamacher===\nHamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a \"Special Permit,\" certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his permit so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.\n\n===Franz Kemmerich===\nA young boy of only 19 years. Franz Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, B\u00e4umer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, M\u00fcller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone steals Kemmerich's watch that he intended to give to his mother, causing him great distress and prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends visit him in the hospital. Paul later finds the watch and hands it over to Kemmerich's mother, only to lie and say Franz died instantly and painlessly when questioned.\n\n===Joseph Behm===\nA student in Paul's class who is described as youthful and overweight. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war, but eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in [[no man's land]] and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around [[no-man's-land]], it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.\n\n==Publication and reception==\nFrom November 10 to December 9, 1928, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was published in serial form in ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' magazine. It was released in book form the following year to smashing success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in [[World War I]] had waned more than 10 years after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivors\u2014soldiers and civilians alike\u2014and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.\n\nWith ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, \"destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells.\" Remarque's harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging [[Nazi Party]] and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' became one of the first [[degenerate art|degenerate books]] to be publicly burnt;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/remarque-publishes-all-quiet-on-the-western-front|title=Nov 10, 1928: Remarque publishes All Quiet on the Western Front|work=[[History.com]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> in 1930, screenings of the [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|Academy Award-winning film based on the book]] were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.<ref name=SI>{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, objections to Remarque\u2019s portrayal of the German army personnel during World War I were not limited to the Nazis. Dr. Karl Kroner ([[:de:Karl Kroner|de]]) objected to Remarque\u2019s depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Dr. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War. He offered the following clarification: \u201cPeople abroad will draw the following conclusions: if German doctors deal with their own fellow countrymen in this manner, what acts of inhumanity will they not perpetuate against helpless prisoners delivered up into their hands or against the populations of occupied territory?\u201d<ref name=\"clardy\">{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615102102/http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 15, 2013|title=All Quiet on the Western Front: Reception|author=Patrick Clardy|work=Yale Modernism Lab|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"barker\">{{cite book|first1=Christine R.|last1=Barker|first2=Rex William|last2=Last|title=Erich Maria Remarque|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nA fellow patient of Remarque\u2019s in the military hospital in [[Duisburg]] objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients, and of the general portrayal of soldiers: \u201cThere were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.\u201d<ref name=\"barker\"/>\n\nThese criticisms suggest that perhaps experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time.

By the 1940s, the term was commonly capitalized (''Negro''); but by the mid-1960s, it was considered disparaging. By the end of the 20th century, ''negro'' had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a [[pejorative]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|title=An Introduction to American English|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-19792-8|page=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Talmadge|author2=James Stewart|title=Introduction to African American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&pg=PA3|year=2007|publisher=Black Classics Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-58073-039-6|page=3}}</ref> The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/|title=They Put 'Negro' on There?|author=Chris Good|date=March 26, 2010|website=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref> The term remains in use in some contexts, such as the [[United Negro College Fund]], an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities.\n\nThere are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use (e.g., ''[[nigger]]''), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century. One exception is the use, among the black community, of the slur ''nigger'' rendered as ''[[nigga]]'', representing the pronunciation of the word in [[African American English]]. This usage has been popularized by the [[rap]] and [[hip-hop]] music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and, when used among black people, the word is often used to mean \"[[homie]]\" or \"friend\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAcceptance of intra-group usage of the word ''nigga'' is still debated, although it has established a foothold among younger generations. The [[NAACP]] denounces the use of both ''nigga'' and ''nigger''. Mixed-race usage of ''nigga'' is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.<ref name=ENQ>Kevin Aldridge, Richelle Thompson and Earnest Winston, [https://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_1the_n-word.html \"The evolving N-word\"], ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 5, 2001.</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main list|Lists of African Americans}}\n\n==See also==\n{{too many see alsos|date=July 2016}}\n{{Portal|African American}}\n{{Col-begin}}\n* [[African American art]]\n* [[African-American business history]]\n* [[African-American civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)]]\n* [[African-American civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)]]\n* [[Timeline of the civil rights movement]]\n* [[African-American literature]]\n* [[African-American middle class]]\n* [[African-American music]]\n* [[African-American names]]\n* [[African American National Biography Project]]\n* [[African-American neighborhood]]\n* [[African-American upper class]]\n* [[Afrophobia]]\n* [[Anglo#Africa|Anglo-African term]]\n* [[Back-to-Africa movement]]\n* [[Black-brown unity]]\n* [[Black feminism]]\n* [[Black History Month]]\n* [[Black Lives Matter]]\n* [[Black Loyalist]]\n* [[Military history of African Americans]]\n* [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]]\n* [[Scientific racism]]\n* [[Stereotypes of African Americans]]\n{{Col-break}}\n'''Diaspora:'''\n* [[African Americans in France]]\n* [[African Americans in Ghana]]\n* [[African immigration to the United States]]\n* [[African diaspora in the Americas]]\n* [[Black Canadians]]\n* [[Black Indians in the United States]]\n* [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans]]\n* [[Igbo Americans]]\n* [[Yoruba Americans]]\n{{Col-break}}\n'''Lists:'''\n* [[Index of articles related to African Americans]]\n* [[List of historically black colleges and universities]]\n* [[List of topics related to the African diaspora]]\n* [[List of populated places in the United States with African-American plurality populations]]\n* [[List of U.S. states by African-American population]]\n* [[List of U.S. counties with African-American majority populations in 2000]]\n* [[List of U.S. metropolitan areas with large African-American populations]]\n* [[List of U.S. cities with large African-American populations]]\n* [[List of U.S. communities with African-American majority populations in 2010]]\n* [[List of African-American neighborhoods]]\n* [[List of black college football classics]]\n* [[Terminology]]: [[Colored]], [[Creole peoples]], [[Negro]], [[Nigger]], [[Nigga]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Altman|first=Susan|title=The Encyclopedia of African-American Heritage|isbn=978-0-8160-4125-1|year=2000}}\n* Finkelman, Paul, ed.

Printed material among the Afrikaners at first used only standard European Dutch. By the mid-19th century, more and more were appearing in Afrikaans, which was very much still regarded as a set of regional dialects.\n\nIn 1861, L.H.

While significant advances had been made in the textual criticism of the Bible, especially the Greek New Testament, the 1933 translation followed the textus receptus and was closely akin to the {{lang|nl|[[Statenbijbel]]}}. Before this, most Cape Dutch-Afrikaans speakers had to rely on the Dutch {{lang|nl|[[Statenbijbel]]}}. This {{lang|nl|[[Statenvertaling]]}} had its origins with the [[Synod of Dordrecht]] of 1618 and was thus in an [[archaism|archaic]] form of Dutch. This was hard for Dutch and Cape Dutch speakers to understand, and increasingly unintelligible for Afrikaans speakers.\n\nC. P. Hoogehout, [[:af:Arnoldus Pannevis|Arnoldus Pannevis]], and [[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit]] were the first [[Bible translations (Afrikaans)|Afrikaans Bible]] translators. Important landmarks in the translation of the Scriptures were in 1878 with C. P. Hoogehout's translation of the ''{{lang|af|Evangelie volgens Markus}}'' ([[Gospel of Mark]], lit. Gospel according to Mark); however, this translation was never published. The manuscript is to be found in the South African National Library, Cape Town.\n\nThe first official translation of the entire Bible into Afrikaans was in 1933 by [[Totius (poet)|J. D. du Toit]], E.

The final editing of this edition was done by E. P. Groenewald, A. H. van Zyl, P. A. Verhoef, J. L. Helberg and W. Kempen. This translation was influenced by Eugene Nida's theory of dynamic-equavalence which focussed on finding the nearest equavalent in the receptor language to the idea that the Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic wanted to convey. The challenge to this type of translation is that it doesn't take into account that there are shifts in meaning in the receptor language.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nA new translation, ''Die Bybel: 'n Direkte Vertaling'' is currently under preparation.

The first was erected in {{lang|af|[[Burgersdorp]]}}, South Africa, in 1893, and the second, nowadays better-known [[Afrikaans Language Monument]] (''{{lang|af|Afrikaanse Taalmonument}}''), was built in [[Paarl]], South Africa, in 1975.\n\nWhen the British design magazine ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''<!--\"Wallpaper\" per WP:MOSTM--> described Afrikaans as \"one of the world's ugliest languages\" in its September 2005 article about the [[Afrikaans Language Monument|monument]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216042054/http://business.iafrica.com/news/657706.htm Rupert snubs mag over Afrikaans slur], Business Africa, 5 December 2005.</ref> South African [[billionaire]] [[Johann Rupert]] (chairman of the [[Richemont|Richemont Group]]), responded by withdrawing advertising for brands such as [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Van Cleef & Arpels]], [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] and [[Alfred Dunhill]] from the magazine.<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/afrikaans-stars-join-row-over-ugly-language-1.261058 Afrikaans stars join row over 'ugly language'] ''[[Cape Argus]]'', 10 December 2005.</ref> The author of the article, Bronwyn Davies, was an [[South African English|English]]-speaking South African.\n\nModern Dutch and Afrikaans share over 90 percent of their vocabulary. Afrikaans speakers are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short time. Native Dutch speakers pick up written Afrikaans even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} whereas understanding spoken Afrikaans might need more effort.

A resurgence in Afrikaans popular music since the late 1990s has invigorated the language, especially among a younger generation of South Africans. A recent trend is the increased availability of pre-school educational CDs and DVDs. Such media also prove popular with the extensive Afrikaans-speaking expatriate communities who seek to retain language proficiency in a household context.\n\nAfter years of slumber, Afrikaans language cinema is showing signs of new vigour. The 2007 film ''{{lang|af|Ouma se slim kind}}'', the first full-length Afrikaans movie since ''[[Paljas]]'' in 1998, is seen as the dawn of a new era in Afrikaans cinema. Several short films have been created and more feature-length movies, such as ''{{lang|af|Poena is Koning}}'' and ''{{lang|af|[[Bakgat]]}}'' (both in 2008) have been produced, besides the 2011 Afrikaans-language film ''{{lang|af|[[Skoonheid]]}}'', which was the first Afrikaans film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival.

SABC3 announced early in 2009 that it would increase Afrikaans programming due to the \"growing Afrikaans-language market and [their] need for working capital as Afrikaans advertising is the only advertising that sells in the current South African television market\".

The preterite of ''{{lang|af|mag}}'' (\"may\") is rare in contemporary Afrikaans.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ffdead;\"\n! colspan=2 | Afrikaans\n! colspan=2 | Dutch\n! colspan=2 | English\n! colspan=2 | German\n|-\n! present\n! past\n! present\n! past\n! present\n! past\n! present\n! past\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek is}} || {{lang|af|ek was}} || {{lang|nl|ik ben}} || {{lang|nl|ik was}} || I am || I was  || {{lang|de|ich bin}} || {{lang|de|ich war}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek kan}} || {{lang|af|ek kon}} || {{lang|nl|ik kan}} || {{lang|nl|ik kon}} || I can || I could || {{lang|de|ich kann}} || {{lang|de|ich konnte}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek moet}} || {{lang|af|ek moes}} || {{lang|nl|ik moet}} || {{lang|nl|ik moest}} || I must || I had to || {{lang|de|ich muss}} || {{lang|de|ich musste}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek wil}} || {{lang|af|ek wou}} || {{lang|nl|ik wil}} || {{lang|nl|ik wilde/wou}} || I want || I wanted || {{lang|de|ich will}} || {{lang|de|ich wollte}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek sal}} || {{lang|af|ek sou}} || {{lang|nl|ik zal}} || {{lang|nl|ik zou}} || I will || I would || {{lang|de|ich werde}} || {{lang|de|ich wurde}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek mag}} || {{lang|af|(ek mog)}} || {{lang|nl|ik mag}} || {{lang|nl|ik mocht}} || I may || I might || {{lang|de|ich mag}} || {{lang|de|ich mochte}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek dink}} || {{lang|af|ek dog}} || {{lang|nl|ik denk}} || {{lang|nl|ik dacht}} || I think || I thought || {{lang|de|ich denke}} || {{lang|de|ich dachte}}\n|}\n\nAll other verbs use the perfect tense (''h\u00ea'' + past participle) for the past. Therefore, there is no distinction in Afrikaans between ''I drank'' and ''I have drunk''. (Also in colloquial German, the past tense is often replaced with the perfect.)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ffdead;\"\n! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek het gedrink}} || {{lang|nl|ik dronk}} || I drank || {{lang|de|ich trank}}\n|-\n| {{lang|af|ek het gedrink}} || {{lang|nl|ik heb gedronken}} || I have drunk || {{lang|de|ich habe getrunken}}\n|}\n\nWhen telling a longer story, Afrikaans speakers usually avoid the perfect and simply use the present tense, or [[historical present tense]] instead (as is possible, but less common, in English as well).\n\nA particular feature of Afrikaans is its use of the [[double negative]]; it is classified in Afrikaans as ''{{lang|af|ontkennende vorm}}'' and is something that is absent from the other West Germanic standard languages. For example,\n\n: {{lang-af|Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie'''|lit=He can not Afrikaans speak not|links=no}}\n: {{lang-nl|Hij spreekt '''geen''' Afrikaans.|links=no}} / ''{{lang-nl|Hij kan '''geen''' Afrikaans praten.}}''\n: English: He speaks '''''no''''' Afrikaans. / He can '''''not''''' speak Afrikaans. / He '''''can't''''' speak Afrikaans.\n: {{lang-de|Er spricht '''kein''' Afrikaans.|links=no}}\n: {{lang-fr|Il '''ne''' parle '''pas''' afrikaans.|links=no}}\n\nBoth French and San origins have been suggested for double negation in Afrikaans. While double negation is still found in [[Low Franconian dialects]] in [[West-Flanders]] and in some \"isolated\" villages in the centre of the Netherlands (such as [[Garderen]]), it takes a different form, which is not found in Afrikaans. The following is an example:\n\n: {{lang-af|Ek wil dit nie doen nie.|links=no}}<sup>*</sup> (''lit.'' I want this not do not.)\n: {{lang-nl|Ik wil dit niet doen.|links=no}}\n: English: I do not want to do this.\n: {{lang-de|Ich will dies nicht tun.|links=no}}\n\n<sup>*</sup> Compare with ''{{lang|af|Ek wil nie dit doen nie}}'', which changes the meaning to \"I want not to do this.\" Whereas ''{{lang|af|Ek wil nie dit doen nie}}'' emphasizes a lack of desire to act, ''{{lang|af|Ek wil dit nie doen nie}}'' emphasizes the act itself.\n\nThe ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}'' was the Middle Dutch way to negate but it has been suggested that since ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}'' became highly non-voiced, '''''{{lang|dum|nie}}''''' or '''''{{lang|dum|niet}}''''' was needed to complement the ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}''. With time the ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}'' disappeared in most Dutch dialects.\n\nThe double negative construction has been fully grammaticalised in standard Afrikaans and its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as the examples below show:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Afrikaans\n! Dutch (literally translated)\n! More correct Dutch\n! English\n|-\n| {{lang|af|Ek het nie geweet dat hy sou kom nie.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Ik heb niet geweten dat hij zou komen.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Ik wist niet dat hij zou komen.}}\n| I did not know that he would come.\n|-\n| {{lang|af|Ek het geweet dat hy nie sou kom nie.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Ik heb geweten dat hij niet zou komen.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Ik wist dat hij niet zou komen.}}\n| I knew (did know) that he would not come.\n|-\n| {{lang|af|Ek het nie geweet dat hy nie sou kom nie.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Ik heb niet geweten dat hij niet zou komen.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Ik wist niet dat hij niet zou komen.}}\n| I did not know that he would not come.\n|-\n| {{lang|af|Hy sal<ref>''{{lang|af|kan}}'' would be best used in this case because ''{{lang|af|kan nie}}'' means cannot and since he is sick he is unable to come, whereas ''{{lang|af|sal}}'' is \"will\" in English and is thus not the best word choice.</ref> nie kom nie, want hy is siek.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Hij zal niet komen, want hij is ziek.}}\n| {{lang|nl|Hij komt niet, want hij is ziek.}}\n| He will not come, as he is sick.\n|-\n| {{lang|af|Dis (Dit is) nie so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer nie.}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | {{lang|nl|Het is niet zo moeilijk (om) Afrikaans te leren.}}\n| It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.\n|}\n\nA notable exception to this is the use of the negating grammar form that coincides with negating the English present participle. In this case there is only a single negation.\n\n: {{lang-af|Hy is in die hospitaal, maar hy eet nie.|links=no}}\n: {{lang-nl|Hij is in het ziekenhuis, maar hij eet niet.|links=no}}\n: English: He is in [the] hospital, though he eats not.\n: {{lang-de|Er ist im Krankenhaus, aber er isst nicht.|links=no}}\n\nCertain words in Afrikaans arise due to grammar. For example, ''{{lang|af|moet nie}}'', which literally means \"must not\", usually becomes ''{{lang|af|moenie}}''; although one does not have to write or say it like this, virtually all Afrikaans speakers will change the two words to ''{{lang|af|moenie}}'' in the same way as ''do not'' shifts to ''don't'' in English.\n\nThe Dutch word ''{{lang|nl|het}}'' (\"it\" in English) does not correspond to ''{{lang|af|het}}'' in Afrikaans. The Dutch words corresponding to Afrikaans ''{{lang|af|het}}'' are ''{{lang|nl|heb}}'', ''{{lang|nl|hebt}}'', ''{{lang|nl|heeft}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|hebben}}''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are 26 letters.\n\nIn Afrikaans, many consonants are dropped from the earlier Dutch spelling. For example, ''{{lang|nl|slechts}}'' ('only') in Dutch becomes ''{{lang|af|slegs}}'' in Afrikaans. Also, Afrikaans and some Dutch dialects make no distinction between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, having merged the latter into the former; while the word for \"south\" is written ''{{lang|nl|zuid}}'' in Dutch, it is spelled ''{{lang|af|suid}}'' in Afrikaans (as well as dialectal Dutch writings) to represent this merger. Similarly, the Dutch digraph ''{{lang|nl|[[IJ (digraph)|\u0133]]}}'', normally pronounced as {{IPA|/\u0259i/}}, is written as ''{{lang|af|y}}'', except where it replaces the Dutch [[affix|suffix]] ''{{lang|nl|\u2013lijk}}'' which is pronounced as {{IPA|/l\u0153k/}} or {{IPA|/lik/}}, as in ''{{lang|nl|waarschijnlijk}} > {{lang|af|waarskynlik}}''.\n\nAnother difference is the indefinite article, ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' in Afrikaans and {{lang|nl|een}} in Dutch. \"A book\" is ''{{lang|af|'n boek}}'' in Afrikaans, whereas it is either ''{{lang|nl|een boek}}'' or ''{{lang|nl|'n boek}}'' in Dutch. This ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' is usually pronounced as just a [[weak vowel]], {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.\n\nThe [[diminutive]] suffix in Afrikaans is ''{{lang|af|-tjie}}'', whereas in Dutch it is ''{{lang|nl|-tje}}'', hence a \"bit\" is {{Lang|af|bie'''tjie'''}} in Afrikaans and {{Lang|nl|bee'''tje'''}} in Dutch.\n\nThe letters ''c'', ''q'', ''x'', and ''z'' occur almost exclusively in borrowings from French, English, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. This is usually because words that had ''c'' and ''ch'' in the original Dutch are spelled with ''k'' and ''g'', respectively, in Afrikaans. Similarly original ''qu'' and ''x'' are spelt ''kw'' and ''ks'', respectively. For example, ''{{lang|af|ekwatoriaal}}'' instead of ''equatoriaal'', and ''{{lang|af|ekskuus}}'' instead of ''excuus''.\n\nThe vowels with diacritics in non-loanword Afrikaans are: ''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00ea'', ''\u00eb'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00ee'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00f4'', ''\u00fa'', ''\u00fb'', ''\u00fd''. Diacritics are ignored when alphabetising, though they are still important, even when typing the diacritic forms may be difficult. For example, ''{{lang|af|ge\u00ebet}}'' instead of the 3 e's alongside each other: ''*{{lang|af|geeet}}'', which can never occur in Afrikaans, or ''{{lang|af|s\u00ea}}'', which translates to \"say\", whereas ''{{lang|af|se}}'' is a possessive form.\n\n===Initial apostrophes===\nA few short words in Afrikaans take initial apostrophes. In modern Afrikaans, these words are always written in lower case (except if the entire line is uppercase), and if they occur at the beginning of a sentence, the next word is capitalised. Three examples of such apostrophed words are ''{{lang|af|'k, 't, 'n}}''. The last (the indefinite article) is the only apostrophed word that is common in modern written Afrikaans, since the other examples are shortened versions of other words (''{{lang|af|ek}}'' and ''{{lang|af|het}}'', respectively) and are rarely found outside of a poetic context.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.101languages.net/afrikaans/grammar.html |title=Retrieved 12 April 2010 |publisher=101languages.net |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015164510/http://101languages.net/afrikaans/grammar.html |archivedate= 15 October 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nHere are a few examples:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Alford]]'' (1970).<ref name=\"wild\" /><ref name=\"champion\" /> Henry Alford had been [[indictment|indicted]] on a charge of [[first-degree murder]] in 1963. Evidence in the case included testimony from witnesses that Alford had said, after the victim's death, that he had killed the individual. Court testimony showed that Alford and the victim had argued at the victim's house. Alford left the house, and afterwards the victim received a fatal [[gunshot wound]] when he opened the door responding to a knock.<ref name=\"walburn\" />\n\nAlford was faced with the possibility of [[capital punishment]] if convicted by a [[jury trial]].<ref name=\"solgan\" /> The death penalty was the default sentence by [[North Carolina]] law at the time, if two requisites in the case were satisfied: the defendant had to have pleaded not guilty, and the jury did not instead recommend a [[life sentence]]. Had he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, Alford would have had the possibility of a life sentence and would have avoided the death penalty, but he did not want to admit guilt. Nonetheless, Alford pleaded guilty to [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]] and said he was doing so to avoid a death sentence, were he to be convicted of first-degree murder, after attempting to contest that charge.<ref name=\"walburn\" /><ref name=\"feinman\">{{cite book | last =Feinman | first = Jay M. | title =Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal System | publisher =[[Oxford University Press, USA]] | year =2006 | page =327 | isbn =0-19-517957-9 }}</ref> Alford was sentenced to 30 years in prison after the trial judge accepted the plea bargain and ruled that the defendant had been adequately advised by his defense lawyer.<ref name=\"walburn\" />\n\n[[File:Justice White Official.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Byron White]] wrote the decision for the majority.]]\nAlford appealed and requested a new trial, arguing he was forced into a guilty plea because he was afraid of receiving a death sentence. The [[Supreme Court of North Carolina]] ruled that the defendant had voluntarily entered the guilty plea with knowledge of what that meant. Following this ruling, Alford petitioned for a [[writ of habeas corpus]] in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina]], which upheld the initial ruling, and subsequently to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]], which ruled that Alford's plea was not voluntary, because it was made under fear of the death penalty.<ref name=\"walburn\" /> \"I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't, they would gas me for it,\" wrote Alford in one of his appeals.<ref name=\"barksdale\" />\n\nThe case was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Thus, intuitionists are ready to accept a statement of the form \"P or Q\" as true [[Disjunction and existence properties|only if we can prove P or if we can prove Q.]] In particular, we cannot in general claim that \"P or not P\" is true (the [[law of excluded middle]]), since in some cases [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|we may not be able to prove the statement \"P\" nor prove the statement \"not P\"]]. Similarly, intuitionists object to the [[existence property]] for classical logic, where one can prove <math>\\exists x.\\phi(x)</math>, without being able to produce any term <math>t</math> of which <math>\\phi</math> holds.\n\nDummett argues that this notion of truth lies at the bottom of various classical forms of anti-realism, and uses it to re-interpret [[phenomenalism]], claiming that it need not take the form of [[reductionism]].\n\nDummett's writings on anti-realism draw heavily on the later writings of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], concerning meaning and rule following, and can be seen as an attempt to integrate central ideas from the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' into the constructive tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] deriving from [[Gottlob Frege]].\n\n===Scientific anti-realism<!--'Scientific anti-realism' and 'Scientific antirealism' redirect here-->===\n{{also|Semantic anti-realism (philosophy of science)}}\nIn [[philosophy of science]], anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of \"unobservable\" [[entity|entities]] such as [[electron]]s or [[gene]]s, which are not detectable with human senses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction Of What?|last=Hacking|first=Ian|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=84}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction|last=Okasha|first=Samir|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nOne prominent variety of '''scientific anti-realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> is [[instrumentalism]], which takes a purely agnostic view towards the existence of unobservable entities, in which the unobservable entity X serves as an instrument to aid in the success of theory Y does not require proof for the existence or non-existence of X.\n\nSome scientific anti-realists, however, deny that unobservables exist, even as non-truth conditioned instruments.\n\n===Mathematical anti-realism===\n{{main|Mathematical anti-realism}}\n{{also|Post rem structuralism}}\nIn the [[philosophy of mathematics]], realism is the claim that mathematical entities such as 'number' have an observer-independent existence. [[Mathematical empiricism|Empiricism]], which associates numbers with concrete physical objects, and [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]], in which numbers are abstract, non-physical entities, are the preeminent forms of mathematical realism.\n\nThe \"[[epistemic]] argument\" against Platonism has been made by [[Paul Benacerraf]] and [[Hartry Field]]. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are ''[[abstract object|abstract]]'' entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact [[causal]]ly with physical entities (\"the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time\"<ref>Field, Hartry, 1989, ''Realism, Mathematics, and Modality'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 68</ref>) Whilst our knowledge of physical objects is based on our ability to [[perception|perceive]] them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.<ref>\"Since abstract objects are outside the nexus of causes and effects, and thus perceptually inaccessible, they cannot be known through their effects on us\" \u2014 [[Jerrold Katz]], ''Realistic Rationalism'', 2000, p. 15</ref><ref>[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue81/ Philosophy Now: \"Mathematical Knowledge: A dilemma\"]</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/#EpiAcc Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\nField developed his views into [[Mathematical fictionalism|fictionalism]]. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of [[mathematical structuralism]], according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.\n\n====Counterarguments<!--'Realistic rationalism' redirects here-->====\nAnti-realist arguments hinge on the idea that a satisfactory, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] account of thought processes can be given for mathematical reasoning. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] that involves contact with the [[Platonic realm]], as in the argument given by [[Sir Roger Penrose]].<ref>[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheEmperorsNewMind Review of] [[The Emperor's New Mind]]</ref>\n\nAnother line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by [[Jerrold Katz]] in his 2000 book ''Realistic Rationalism''. In this book, he put forward a position called '''realistic rationalism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, which combines metaphysical realism and [[rationalism]].\n\nA more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world, i.e. the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] (a variety of [[mathematicism]]). In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Arend Heyting]]\n* [[Constructivist epistemology]]\n* [[Crispin Wright]]\n* [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]]\n* [[M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma]]\n* [[Neil Tennant (philosopher)]]\n* [[Philosophical realism]]\n* [[Quasi-realism]]\n{{div end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | author=Michael Dummett | title=Truth and Other Enigmas | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1978 | ref=Dummett(1978) }}\n** {{citation | author=Michael Dummett | title=Truth | year=1963 | ref=Truth (1959) }}. reprinted, pp.&nbsp;1\u201324.\n** {{citation | author=Michael Dummett | title=Realism | year=1963 | ref=Realism (1963) }}. reprinted, pp.&nbsp;145\u2013165.\n** {{citation | author=Michael Dummett | title=Platonism | year=1967 | ref=Platonism (1967) }}. reprinted, pp.&nbsp;202\u2013214.\n* Christine Baron, [[Manfred Engel]] (eds.)

The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub.

The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.{{sfn|Soar|Tyler|2011|ps=.

The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.<ref name=\"conservation_plan\"/> The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.<ref name=\"conservation_plan\"/>\n\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993\u201394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=The+Club&article=344883&Title=Highbury\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223345/http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=The+Club&article=344883&Title=Highbury\n |archivedate=11 January 2008\n |title=Highbury\n |publisher=Arsenal F.C\n |deadurl=yes\n |df= \n}}</ref> This capacity had to be reduced further during [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which could house more than 70,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138932.stm | title=Arsenal get Wembley go-ahead |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=24 July 1998 | accessdate=11 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|right|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium.

The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, supporters sing \"One-Nil to the Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\").\n\nThere have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography.

Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American cuisine. The [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement of the Americas]] yielded the introduction of a number of various ingredients, spices, herbs, and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many different nations; this influx nurtured a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.\n\nWhen the [[colonist]]s came to the colonies, they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion to what they had done in Europe. They had cuisine similar to their previous [[British cuisine]]. The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which someone lived. Commonly hunted [[Game (hunting)|game]] included deer, bear, [[American bison|buffalo]], and wild turkey. A number of [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s made from animals served to cook much of the colonial foods. Prior to the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], New Englanders consumed large quantities of [[rum]] and [[beer]], as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items: rum was the distilled spirit of choice, as the main ingredient, [[molasses]], was readily available from trade with the [[West Indies]]. In comparison to the northern colonies, the southern colonies were quite diverse in their agricultural diet.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans developed many new foods. During the [[Progressive Era]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, c. 1890s\u20131920s, food production and presentation became more industrialized. One characteristic of American cooking is the [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles. A wave of [[celebrity chef]]s began with [[Julia Child]] and [[Graham Kerr]] in the 1970s, with many more following after the rise of cable channels, such as the [[Food Network]] and [[Cooking Channel]], in the late 20th century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-colonial cuisine===\n\n====Seafood====\n[[File:Blue crab on market in Piraeus - Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 20020819-317.jpg|thumb|right|[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue crab]] was used on the eastern and southern coast of what is now the U.S. mainland.]]\nSeafood in the United States originated with the American Indians in the United States, who often ate [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[lemon sole]], [[flounder]], [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[halibut]], [[sturgeon]], [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[drum (fish)|drum]] on the East Coast, and [[Oily fish|olachen]] and [[salmon]] on the West Coast. Whale was hunted by American Indians off the Northwest coast, especially by the [[Makah people|Makah]], and used for their meat and oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncseonline.org/nae/docs/makahfaq.htm|title=404 Not Found|website=ncseonline.org}}</ref> Seal and walrus were also eaten, in addition to eel from New York's [[Finger Lakes]] region. [[Catfish]] was also popular among native people, including the [[Modoc people|Modocs]]. Crustaceans included [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[Crayfish (food)|crayfish]], and [[dungeness crab]]s in the Northwest and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s in the East. Other shellfish include [[abalone]] and [[geoduck]] on the West Coast, while on the East Coast the [[surf clam]], [[quahog]], and the [[soft-shell clam]]. [[Oyster]]s were eaten on both shores, as were [[mussel]]s and [[Common periwinkle|periwinkle]]s.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=21,22}}</ref>\n\n====Cooking methods====\nEarly American Indians used a number of cooking methods in early American Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American Cuisine. [[Grilling]] meats was common. [[Spit roast]]ing over a pit fire was common as well. Vegetables, especially [[root vegetable]]s were often cooked directly in the ashes of the fire. As early Native Americans lacked pottery that could be used directly over a fire, they developed a technique which has caused many [[anthropologist]]s to call them \"[[Stone Boilers]]\". They would heat rocks directly in a fire and then add the rocks to a pot filled with water until it came to a boil so that it would cook the meat or vegetables in the boiling water. In what is now the Southwestern United States, they also created [[adobe]] ovens, dubbed ''[[horno]]s'' by the [[Conquistadors|Spanish]], to bake products such as [[cornmeal]] bread. Other parts of America dug pit ovens; these pits were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers and then seaweed or corn husks placed on top to steam fish and shellfish as well as vegetables; potatoes would be added while still in skin and corn while in-husk, this would later be referred to as a [[New England clam bake|clambake]] by the colonists.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=31,32}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial period===\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies}}\n[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|thumb|Map of the 13 American Colonies in 1775.]]\n\nWhen the colonists came to [[History of Virginia|Virginia]], [[History of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[History of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], or any of the other English colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America, their initial attempts at survival included planting crops familiar to them from back home in England. In the same way, they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion. Through hardships and eventual establishment of trade with Britain, the [[West Indies]] and other regions, the colonists were able to establish themselves in the American colonies with a cuisine similar to their previous [[British cuisine]]. There were some exceptions to the diet, such as local vegetation and animals, but the colonists attempted to use these items in the same fashion as they had their equivalents or ignore them entirely if they could. The manner of cooking for the American colonists followed along the line of British cookery up until the Revolution. The British sentiment followed in the cookbooks brought to the New World as well.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=512}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1796, the first American cookbook was published, and others followed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stavely|first1=Keith|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=Kathleen|title=Northern Hospitality: Cooking by the Book in New England|year=2011|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]]|pages=7\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRbJUQMM0ssC|accessdate=August 12, 2016|chapter=Culinarily Colonized: Cookbooks in Colonial New England|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRbJUQMM0ssC&lpg=PA7&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|jstor=j.ctt5vk2dv|isbn=1558498613}}</ref> There was a general disdain for [[French cuisine|French cookery]], even with the French [[Huguenot]]s in [[South Carolina]] and French-Canadians. One of the cookbooks that proliferated in the colonies was ''[[The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy]]'' (1747) by [[Hannah Glasse]], who referred to \"the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook!\" Of the French recipes given in the text, she speaks out flagrantly against the dishes as she \"\u2026 think[s] it an odd jumble of trash.\"<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Glasse|1750}}.</ref> Reinforcing the anti-French sentiment was the [[French and Indian War]] from 1754 to 1764. This created a large anxiety against the French, which influenced the English to force many of the French to move, as in the [[expulsion of the Acadians]] from Nova Scotia to Louisiana. The Acadians left a French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana, and among the Acadian Francophones who settled eastern Maine and parts of what is now northern Vermont at the same time they colonized New Brunswick.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=512, Vol. 1}}.</ref>\n\n====Common ingredients====\n[[File:New England clam bake.jpg|thumb|A New England clam bake consists of various steamed [[shellfish]].]]\nThe American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which someone lived. Local cuisine patterns had established by the mid-18th century. The [[New England]] colonies were extremely similar in their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from England. A striking difference for the colonists in New England compared to other regions was seasonality.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Oliver|2005|pp=16\u201319}}.</ref> While in the southern colonies, they could farm almost year-round, in the northern colonies, the growing seasons were very restricted. In addition, colonists' close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their diet, especially in the northern colonies.\n\n[[Wheat]], however, the grain used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow, and imports of wheat were far from cost productive.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=25}}.</ref>{{dubious|Clarify timeperiod and location(New England?)|date=July 2015}} Substitutes in cases such as this included cornmeal. The [[Johnnycake]] was a poor substitute to some for wheaten bread, but acceptance by both the northern and southern colonies seems evident.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Oliver|2005|p=22}}.</ref>\n\nAs many of the New Englanders were originally from England, game hunting was useful when they immigrated to the [[New World]]. Many of the northern colonists depended upon their ability to hunt, or upon others from whom they could purchase game. Hunting was the preferred method of protein consumption. This was opposed to animal husbandry, which required much more work to defend the kept animals against raids.\n\n=====Livestock and game=====\nCommonly hunted game included deer, bear, [[American bison|buffalo]], and wild turkey. The larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant sauce, while the other smaller portions went into [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s, [[sausage]]s, [[pie]]s, and pastries.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=546\u2013547, Vol. 1}}.</ref> In addition to game, colonists' protein intake was supplemented by [[mutton]]. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[Florida]] originally introduced [[sheep]] to the New World, but this development never quite reached the North, and there they were introduced by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and English. The keeping of sheep was a result of the English non-practice of [[animal husbandry]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=26, Vol. 2}}.</ref> The animals provided wool when young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer desirable.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=176\u2013182}}</ref> The forage-based diet for sheep that prevailed in the Colonies produced a characteristically strong, gamy flavor and a tougher consistency, which required aging and slow cooking to tenderize.<ref>{{cite news |first=R.W. |last=Apple Jr. |title=Much Ado About Mutton, but Not in These Parts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/dining/29mutt.html |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=March 29, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2008 |quote=Until it fell from favor after World War II, it was a favorite of most Britons, who prized [[mutton]] above lamb (from younger animals) for its texture and flavor.

Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear oil for cooking, while solidified bear fat resembled [[shortening]]. Rendered [[pork]] fat made the most popular cooking medium, especially from the cooking of [[bacon]]. Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the South. The colonists enjoyed [[butter]] in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the [[American Revolution]], as [[cattle]] were not yet plentiful.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=458\u2013459, Vol. 2}}.</ref>\n\n=====Alcoholic drinks=====\nPrior to the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], New Englanders consumed large quantities of [[rum]] and [[beer]], as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice, as the main ingredient, [[molasses]], was readily available from trade with the West Indies. Further into the interior, however, one would often find colonists consuming [[whiskey]], as they did not have similar access to [[sugar cane]]. They did have ready access to corn and rye, which they used to produce their whiskey.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=17}}.</ref> However, until the Revolution, many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for human consumption, as many believed that it caused the poor to become raucous and unkempt drunkards.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Crowgey|1971|pp=18\u201319}}.</ref> In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, imports were seen on merchant shelves, including [[wine]] and [[brandy]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n=====Southern variations=====\nIn comparison to the northern colonies, the [[Southern Colonies]] were quite diverse in their agricultural diet. The uplands of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal lowlands]] made up the two main parts of the southern colonies. The diet of the uplands often included wild game, [[cabbage]], [[Green bean|string beans]], [[corn]], [[Cucurbita|squashes]] and white [[potato]]es. People had biscuits as part of their [[breakfast]], along with healthy portions of pork.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=47\u201348}}.</ref> The lowlands of Louisiana included a varied diet heavily influenced by the French, Spanish, Acadians, Germans, Native Americans, Africans and Caribbeans. Rice played a large part of the diet in Louisiana. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal seafood. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does to this day.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=48\u201349}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=149, Vol. 2}}.</ref>\n\n===Post-colonial cuisine===\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans developed many new foods. Some, such as [[Rocky Mountain oyster]]s, stayed regional; some spread throughout the nation but with little international appeal, such as [[peanut butter]] (a core ingredient of the [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]]); and some spread throughout the world, such as [[popcorn]], [[cola]], [[fried chicken]], [[cornbread]], unleavened [[muffin]]s such as the [[poppyseed muffin]], and [[Chocolate brownie|brownies]].\n\n===Modern cuisine===\nIn the 20th century highly [[Industrialized food|industrialized]] [[processed food]]s became a dominant feature of American diets.  Also appropriation and fusion of the food traditions of various [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant groups]] to the US created distinctly Ethnic-American food styles.\n\n====Processed food====\nDuring the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s\u20131920s) food production and presentation became more industrialized. Major railroads featured upscale cuisine in their dining cars.<ref>James D. Porterfield, ''Dining by Rail: The History and Recipes of America's Golden Age of Railroad Cuisine'' (1993)</ref> Restaurant chains emerged with standardized decor and menus, including the [[Fred Harvey Company|Fred Harvey]] restaurants along the route of the Sante Fe Railroad in the Southwest.<ref>Stephen Fried, ''Appetite for America: How Visionary Businessman Fred Harvey Built a Railroad Hospitality Empire That Civilized the Wild West'' (Bantam; 2010)</ref>\n\nAt the universities, nutritionists and home economists taught a new scientific approach to food. During World War I the [[Progressives]]' moral advice about food conservation was emphasized in large-scale state and federal programs designed to educate housewives. Large-scale foreign aid during and after the war brought American standards to Europe.<ref>Helen Zoe Veit, ''Modern Food, Moral Food: Self-Control, Science, and the Rise of Modern American Eating in the Early Twentieth Century'' (2013)</ref>\n\nThe logistical requirements of the US military during WW2 spurred the development and growth of the processed foods industry in the US.  <ref>{{cite web |last1=Twilley |first1=Nicola |title=How Military R&D Created The Food We Eat |url=https://www.popsci.com/how-military-created-food-we-know-it |website=Popular Science |accessdate=12 September 2018 |language=en |date=10 August 2015}}</ref>The war encouraged production of shelf-stable ingredients processed on a vast industrial scale.

It includes the six states of [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]], with its largest city and cultural capital [[Boston]], founded in 1630. The Native American cuisine became part of the cookery style that the early colonists brought with them. Tribes like the [[Nipmuck]], [[Wampanoag]], and other Algonquian cultures were noted for slashing and burning areas to create meadows and bogs that would attract animals like [[Eastern moose|moose]] and [[white tailed deer|deer]], but also encourage the growth of plants like [[black raspberries]], [[lowbush blueberry|blueberries]], and [[Cranberry|cranberries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-55.html|title=Brothertown Culture - Indian Country Wisconsin|website=Mpm.edu|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> In the forest they would have collected nuts of species like the [[shagbark hickory]], [[corylus americana|American hazel]], and [[castanea dentata|American chestnuts]] and fruits like wild [[vitis labrusca|grapes]] and [[prunus serotina|black cherries]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Connole|first1=Dennis A.|title=The Indians of the Nipmuck Country in Southern New England, 1630-1750: An Historical Geography|date=December 15, 2000|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB1Et3yHBxIC|accessdate=August 12, 2016|isbn=9780786450114}}</ref> All of these eventually showed up in the kitchens of colonial New England women<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teachervision.com/foods/lesson-plan/3257.html|title=Colonial New England Food & Cooking|website=Teachervision.com|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> and many were sent back to England and other portions of Europe to be catalogued by scientists, collectors, and horticulturalists.\n\nThe style of New England cookery originated from its colonial roots, that is to say practical, frugal, and willing to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=181\u2013182}}.</ref> Most of the initial colonists came from [[East Anglia]] in England, with other groups following them over the ages like francophone regions of [[Canada]] (this was especially true of Northern New England, where there are still many speakers of a [[New England French|dialect of French]]), from Ireland, from Southern Italy, and most recently from Haiti, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Portugal. The oldest forms of the cuisine date to the early 17th century and in the case of Massachusetts, out of the entire country only the state of Virginia can claim recipes that are older. East Anglian cookery would have included recipes for dishes like suet puddings, wheaten breads, and a few shellfish delicacies, like winkles, and would have been at the time of settlement simple Puritan fare quite in contrast to the fineries and excesses expected in London cavalier circles. Most of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such dishes as [[succotash]], [[chowder]], [[baked beans]], and others.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|p=13}}</ref> Starches are fairly simple, and typically encompass just a handful of classics like [[potato]]es and [[cornmeal]], and a few native breads like [[Anadama bread]], [[johnnycake]]s, [[bulkie roll]]s, [[Parker house roll]]s, [[popover]]s, and [[New England brown bread]]. This region is fairly conservative with its spices, but typical spices include [[nutmeg]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, and [[allspice]], especially in desserts, and for savory foods, [[thyme]], [[black pepper]], [[sea salt]], and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]]. Typical condiments include [[maple syrup]], grown from the native [[sugar maple]], [[molasses]], and [[cranberry sauce]].\n\nNew England is noted for having a heavy emphasis on seafood, a legacy inherited from coastal tribes like the [[Wampanoag]] and [[Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island|Narragansett]], who equally used the rich fishing banks offshore for sustenance. Favorite fish include [[Atlantic cod|cod]], [[Atlantic salmon|salmon]], [[winter flounder]], [[haddock]], [[striped bass]], [[pollock]], [[hake]], [[bluefish]], and, in southern New England, [[tautog]]. All of these are prepared numerous ways, such as frying cod for fish fingers, grilling bluefish over hot coals for summertime, smoking salmon or serving a whole poached one chilled for feasts with a dill sauce, or, on cold winter nights, serving haddock baked in casserole dish with a creamy sauce and crumbled breadcrumbs as a top so it forms a crust.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10595677] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211050451/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10595677|date=December 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Clam cakes]], a savory fritter based on chopped clams, are a specialty of Rhode Island.

Today turkey meat is a key ingredient in soups, and also a favorite in several sandwiches like the [[Pilgrim (sandwich)|Pilgrim]].

Vermont is known for producing farmhouse style cheeses, especially a type of cheddar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cheeseandyogurtmaking.com/blog/state-best-cheddar-cheese-vermont-wisconsin/|title=Which State Has The Best Cheddar Cheese - Vermont or Wisconsin? - Cheese and Yogurt Making|date=May 1, 2014|website=Cheeseandyogurtmaking.com|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> The recipe goes all the way back to colonial times when English settlers brought the recipe with them from England and found the rocky landscape eminently suitable to making the cheese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culturecheesemag.com/blog/distant-cheeses-local-farmers-cheddar-across-continents|title=Distant Cheeses, Local Farmers: Cheddar Across Continents - culture: the word on cheese|date=February 7, 2013|website=Culturecheeesemag.com|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> Today Vermont has more artisanal cheese makers per capita than any other state, and diversity is such that interest in goat's milk cheeses has become prominent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nutrition.uvm.edu/viac/index.cfm?pg=Mission&section=about|title=VIAC Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese - cheesemaking at UVM, the University of Vermont|website=Nutrition.uvm.edu|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrustaceans and mollusks are also an essential ingredient in the regional cookery. Maine is noted for harvesting [[peekytoe crab]] and [[Jonah crab]] and making crab bisques, based on cream with 35% milkfat, and crabcakes out of them, and often they appear on the menu as far south as to be out of region in [[New York City]], where they are sold to four star restaurants. Squid are heavily fished for and eaten as [[fried calamari]], and often are an ingredient in [[Italian American]] cooking in this region. Whelks are eaten in salad, and [[lobster]], which is indigenous to the coastal waters of the region and are a feature of many dishes, baked, boiled, roasted, and steamed, or simply eaten as a [[lobster roll|sandwich]], chilled with mayonnaise and chopped celery in Maine and Massachusetts, or slathered with melted butter on Long Island and in Connecticut.\n\nShellfish of all sorts are part of the diet, and [[shellfish]] of the coastal regions include [[Cherrystone clam#Alternative names|little neck clam]]s, [[Scallop|sea scallop]]s, [[blue mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Soft-shell clam|soft shell clam]]s, and [[Atlantic jackknife clam|razor shell clam]]s. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the [[New England clam bake|clambake]]. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|pp=12\u201319}}</ref> In summer, oysters and clams are dipped in batter and fried, often served in a basket with french fries, or commonly on a wheaten bun as a clam roll. Oysters are otherwise eaten chilled on a bed of crushed ice on the half shell with mignonette sauce, and are often branded on where they were harvested. Large quahogs are stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning and baked in their shells, and smaller ones often find their way into [[clam chowder]]. Other preparations include [[clams casino]], clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like [[oregano]] and streaky bacon.\n\nThe fruits of the region include the ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' grapes used in [[grape juice]] made by companies such as [[Welch's]], along with [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], [[Kosher wine]] by companies like [[Mogen David]] and [[Manischewitz]] along with other wineries that make higher quality wines. [[Apple]]s from New England include the traditional varieties [[Baldwin (apple)|Baldwin]], Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise, Porter, [[Roxbury Russet]], Wright, Sops of Wine, Hightop Sweet, Peck's Pleasant, Titus Pippin, Westfield-Seek-No-Further, and Duchess of Oldenburg. [[Beach plum]]s a small native species with fruits the size of a pinball, are sought after in summer to make into a jam. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] are another fruit indigenous to the region, often collected in autumn in huge flooded bogs. Thereafter they are juiced so they can be drunk fresh for breakfast, or dried and incorporated into salads.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|pp=24\u201326}}</ref> Winter squashes like pumpkin and butternut squashes have been a staple for generations owing to their ability to keep for long periods over icy New England winters and being an excellent source of beta carotene; in summer, they are replaced with pattypan and zucchini, the latter brought to the region by immigrants from Southern Italy a century ago. Blueberries are a very common summertime treat owing to them being an important crop, and find their way into [[muffin]]s, [[pie]]s and [[pancake]]s. Typical favorite desserts are quite diverse, and encompass [[hasty pudding]], [[blueberry pie]], [[whoopie pie]]s, [[Boston cream pie]], [[pumpkin pie]], Joe Frogger cookies, hand crafted [[ice cream]], [[Hermit]] cookies, and the [[chocolate chip cookie]], invented in [[Massachusetts]] in the 1930s.\n\nSouthern New England, particularly along the coast, shares many specialties with the Mid-Atlantic, including especially dishes from Jewish and Italian-American cuisine. Coastal Connecticut is known for distinctive kinds of [[pizza]], locally called apizza (pronounced locally as ''abeetz''), differing in texture (thin and slightly blackened) and toppings (such as clams) from pizza further south in the so-called pizza belt, which stretches from [[New Haven, Connecticut]] southward through [[New York City|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and into [[Maryland]].\n\n====Delaware Valley and Mid-Atlantic====\n{{Main|Cuisine of Philadelphia|Cuisine of New York City|Cuisine of the Mid-Atlantic United States}}\n[[File:NY_Strip_Steak.jpg|thumb|[[strip steak|New York strip steak]] topped with mushrooms and onions]]\nThe mid-Atlantic states comprise the states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], and Northern [[Maryland]].

There had been some Irish from Ulster prior to 1820, however largely they had been Protestants with somewhat different culture and (often) a different [[Irish language|language]] than the explosion of emigrants that came to [[Castle Garden]] and Locust Point in Baltimore in their masses starting in the 1840s.\n\nThe Irish arrived in America in a rather woeful state, as Ireland at the time was often plagued by some of the worst poverty in Europe and often heavy disenfranchisement among the masses: many of them arrived barely alive having ridden [[coffin ship]]s to the New World, sick with typhus and starvation. In addition, they were the first to face challenges other groups did not have: they were the first large wave of Catholics. They faced prejudice for their faith and the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore were not always set up for their needs. For example, Catholic bishops in the U.S. mandated until the 1960s that all Catholics were forbidden from eating red meat on Fridays and during Lent,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/steven-greydanus/meatless-fridays|title=Are Meatless Fridays Still a Thing? Does it Matter?|newspaper=National Catholic Register|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> and attending Mass sometimes conflicted with work as produce and meat markets would be open on holy days; this was difficult for Irishmen supporting families since many worked as laborers. Unsurprisingly, many Irishmen also found their fortunes working as longshoremen, which would have given their families access to fish and shellfish whenever a fisherman made berth, which was frequent on the busy docks of Baltimore and New York. Though there had been some activity in Baltimore in founding a [[Holy See|see]] earlier by the Carroltons, the Irish were the first major wave of Catholic worship in this region, and that meant bishops and cardinals sending away to Europe for wine. Part of the Catholic mass includes every parishioner taking a sip of wine from the chalice as part of the Eucharist. Taverns had existed prior to their emigration to America in the region, though the Irish brought their particular brand of pub culture and founded some of the first saloons and bars that served [[stout]] and [[Irish red ale|red ale]]; they brought with them the knowledge of single malt style whiskey and sold it. The Irish were the first immigrant group to arrive in this region in massive millions, and these immigrants also founded some of the earliest saloons and bars in this region, of which [[McSorley's Old Ale House|McSorley's]] is an example.\n\n[[File:Philly style pretzel.JPG|thumb|Philadelphia-style soft pretzel]]\nIt was also in this region that the Irish introduced something that today is a very important festival in American culture that involves a large amount of food, drink, and merry making: [[Halloween]]. In England and Wales, where prior immigrants had come from, the feast of All Hallows Eve had died out in the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], dismissed as superstition and excess having nothing to do with the Bible and often replaced with the festival of [[Guy Fawkes Night]]. Other immigrant groups like the Germans preferred to celebrate October 31 as [[Reformation Day]], and after the American Revolution all of the above were less and less eager to celebrate the legacy of an English festival when they had fought a very bloody war to leave the British Empire. The Catholicism of the Irish demanded attendance at church on November 1 and charity and deeds, not just faith, as a cornerstone of dogma, and many of their older traditions survived the Reformation and traveled with them. Naturally, they went door-to-door to collect victuals for masked parties as well as gave them out, like nuts to roast on the fire, whiskey, beer, or cider, and [[barmbrack]]s; they also [[Apple bobbing|bobbed for apples]] and made dumb cakes. Later in the century they were joined by Scots going [[Trick-or-treating|guising]], children going door-to-door to ask for sweets and treats in costume. From the Mid Atlantic this trend spread to be nationwide and evolved into American children [[trick-or-treating]] on October 31 wearing costumes and their older counterparts having wild costume parties with lots of food and drink like [[caramel apple]]s, [[candy apple]]s, [[dirt cake]]s, [[Punch (drink)|punch]], [[cocktail]]s, [[cider]] (both alcoholic and [[Apple cider|non]],) [[pumpkin pie]], [[candy corn]], [[Turtles (chocolate)|chocolate turtles]], [[peanut brittle]], [[Taffy (candy)|taffy]], [[tipsy cake]], and copious buckets full of candy; children carving [[Jack-o'-lantern|jack-o-lanterns]] and eating squash derived foods derive from Halloween's heritage as a harvest festival and from Irish and Scottish traditions of carving turnips and eating root vegetables at this time of year. Their bobbing for apples has survived to the present day as a Halloween party classic game, as has a variation on the parlor game of trying to grab an apple hanging from the ceiling blindfolded:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R2Y_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=hang+apple+from+ceiling+scotland#v=onepage&q=hang%2520apple%2520from%2520ceiling%2520scotland&f=false|title=Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland|last=Miller|first=Hugh|date=January 1, 1851|publisher=W.

They were employed in manual labor or factory work but it is because of them that dishes like [[spaghetti with meatballs]], [[New York\u2013style pizza]], [[calzones]], and [[baked ziti]] exist, and Americans of today are very familiar with semolina based pasta noodles. Their native cuisine had less of an emphasis on meat, as evidenced by dishes they introduced like [[pasta e fagioli]] and [[minestrone]], but the dishes they created in America often piled it on as a sign of wealth and newfound prosperity since for the first time even cheap cuts of it were affordable: the American recipe for [[Lasagne|lasagna]] is proof of this, as mostly it is derived from the Neapolitan version of the dish with large amounts of meat and cheese.\n\n[[File:Frankfurter stand LOC det.4a13502.jpg|thumb|left|Carts selling frankfurters, the predecessor to [[hotdog]]s, in New York City circa 1906.

Hot dogs are also the focus of a televised eating contest on the Fourth of July in Coney Island,{{cn|date=October 2018}} at [[Nathan's Famous]], one of the earliest hot dog stands opened in the United States in 1916.\n\nA summertime treat, [[Italian ice]], began its life as a lemon flavored penny lick brought to Philadelphia by Italians; its Hispanic counterpart, [[Piragua (food)|piragua]], is a common and evolving shaved ice treat brought to New York City by Puerto Ricans in the 1930s. Unlike the original dish which included flavors like tamarind, mango, coconut, piragua is evolving to include flavors like grape, a fruit not grown in Puerto Rico. [[Taylor ham]], a meat delicacy of [[New Jersey]], first appeared around the time of the Civil War and today is often served for breakfast with eggs and cheese on a kaiser roll, the bread upon which this is served was brought to the area by Austrians in the second half of the nineteenth century and is a very common roll for sandwiches at lunchtime, usually tipped with poppyseeds. This breakfast meat is generally known as pork roll in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, and Taylor ham in northern New Jersey.\n\n[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|''[[Nighthawks]]'', a painting of a [[diner]], one type of eatery still common in the Mid-Atlantic]]\nOther dishes came about during the early 20th century and have much to do with delicatessen fare, set up largely{{cn|date=October 2018}} by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who came to America incredibly poor. Most often they were completely unable to partake in the outdoor food markets that the general population utilized as most of the food for sale was not kosher. The influence of European Jewry before their destruction in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] on modern mid Atlantic cooking remains extremely strong and reinforced by their many descendants in the region. American-style [[dill pickle|pickles]], now a common addition to hamburgers and sandwiches, were brought by Polish Jews, and Hungarian Jews brought a recipe for almond horns that now is a common regional cookie, diverting from the original recipe in dipping the ends in dark chocolate. New York\u2013style cheesecake has copious amounts of cream and eggs because animal [[rennet]] is not [[Kashrut|kosher]] and thus could not be sold to a large number of the deli's clientele. New York inherited its bagels and bialys from Jews, as well as Challah bread. [[Pastrami]] first entered the country via Romanian Jews, and is a feature of many sandwiches, often eaten on marble rye, a bread that was born in the mid-Atlantic. [[Whitefish salad]], [[smoked salmon|lox]], and [[matzoh ball soup]] are now standard fare made to order at local diners and delicatessens, but started their life as foods that made up a strict dietary code.\n\n[[File:Buffalo - Wings at Airport Anchor Bar.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Buffalo wing]]s with [[blue cheese dressing]].]]\nLike other groups before them, many of their dishes passed into the mainstream enough so that they became part of diner fare by the end of the 20th century, a type of restaurant that is now more numerous in this region than any other and formerly the subject matter of artist [[Edward Hopper]]. In the past this sort of establishment was the haven of the short order cook grilling or frying simple foods for the working man. Today typical service would include regional staples like [[beef on weck]], [[Clam chowder#Manhattan clam chowder|Manhattan clam chowder]], the [[club sandwich]], [[Buffalo wings]], [[Cheesesteak|Philadelphia cheesesteak]], the [[black and white cookie]], [[shoofly pie]], [[turtle soup|snapper soup]], [[Smith Island cake]], [[grape pie]], [[milkshake]]s, and the [[egg cream]], a vanilla or chocolate fountain drink with a frothy top and fizzy taste. As in Hopper's painting from 1942, many of these businesses are open 24 hours a day.\n\n===Midwest===\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Midwestern United States}}\nMidwestern cuisine today covers everything from [[Kansas City-style barbecue|Kansas City-style]] [[barbecue]] to the [[Chicago-style hot dog]], though many of its classics are very simple, hearty fare. Mostly this region was completely untouched by European and American settlers until after the [[American Civil War]], and excepting [[Missouri]] and the heavily forested states near the Great Lakes was mainly populated by nomadic tribes like the [[Sioux people|Sioux]], [[Osage people|Osage]], [[Arapaho people|Arapaho]], and [[Cheyenne]]. As with most other American Indians tribes, these tribes consumed the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] of beans, maize, and squash, but also for thousands of years followed the herds of [[American bison|bison]] and hunted them first on foot and then, after the spread of mustangs from the Southwest due to the explorations of conquistadors, on horseback, typically using bow and arrow. There are [[buffalo jump]]s dating back nearly ten thousand years and several photographs and written accounts of trappers and homesteaders attesting to their dependence on the buffalo and to a lesser degree [[elk]]. After nearly wiping out the elk and bison to nothingness, this region has taken to raising bison alongside cattle for their meat and at an enormous profit, making them into burgers and steaks.\n\nThis region today comprises the states near the Great Lakes and also the Great Plains; much of it is prairie with a very flat terrain where the blue sky meets a neverending horizon. Winters are bitterly cold, windy, and wet. Often that means very harsh blizzards especially near the Great Lakes where Arctic winds blow off of Canada and where the ice on rivers and lakes freezes reliably thick enough for [[ice hockey]] to be a favorite pastime in the region and for ice fishing for [[northern pike|pike]], [[walleye]] and [[panfish]] to be ubiquitous in [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Michigan]], where they often there after become part of the local tradition of the [[fish fry]]. Population density is extremely low away from the Great Lakes and very small towns dominated by enormous farms are the rule with larger cities being the exception. [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[St. Louis]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]] and her twin sister city across the river [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] dominate the landscape in wealth and size, owing to their ties with manufacturing, finance, transportation, and meatpacking. Smaller places like [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] make up local capitals, but the king of them all is [[Chicago]], third largest city in the country.\n\n[[File:Persimmon pudding (5180557664).jpg|thumb|Persimmon pudding. This is a dessert staple of the Midwest.]]\nThe Upper Midwest includes the states of [[Illinois]], [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Michigan]]. Non-American Indian settlement began here earlier than anywhere else in the region, and thus the food available here ranges from the sublime to the bizarre. As with all of the Midwest, the primary meats here are beef and poultry, since the Midwest has been raising [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]], [[chicken]]s, and [[Goose|geese]] for over a hundred and fifty years; chickens have been so common for so long that the Midwest has several native breeds that are prized for both backyard farming and for farmer's markets, such as the [[Buckeye chicken|Buckeye]] and [[Wyandotte chicken|Wyandotte]]; one, Billina, appears as a character in the second book of the Oz series by [[L. Frank Baum]]. Favorite fruits of the region include a few native plants inherited from Native American tribes like the [[asimina triloba|pawpaw]] and the [[diospyros virginiana|American persimmon]]s are also highly favored. As with the American South, pawpaws are the region's largest native fruit, about the size of a mango, and are often found growing wild in the region come September, whereafter they are made into preserves and cakes and command quite a price at farmer's markets in Chicago.<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sns-tns-bc-pawpaw-bread-20171002-story.html</ref> The [[American persimmon]] is often smaller than it is Japanese cousin, about the size of a small plum, but in the Midwest and portions of the East it is the main ingredient in a steamed pudding called [[persimmon pudding]], topped with cr\u00e8me anglaise. Other crops inherited from the Native Americans include [[wild rice]], which grows on the banks of lakes and is a local favorite for fancy meals and today often used in stuffing for Thanksgiving.\n\nTypical fruits of the region are cold weather crops. Once it was believed that the region had winters that were far too harsh for apple growing, but then a breeder in [[Minnesota]] came forth with the [[Wealthy (apple)|Wealthy apple]] and thence came forth the third most productive region for apple growing in the land, with local varieties comprising [[Wolf River (apple)|Wolf River]], Enterprise, [[Melrose (apple)|Melrose]], [[Paula Red]], [[Rome Beauty]], [[Honeycrisp]], and the [[Red Delicious]]. Cherries are important to [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] grows many [[Cranberry|cranberries]], a legacy of early-19th-century emigration of New England farmers. [[Crabapple]] jelly is a favorite condiment of the region.\n\nThe influence of German, Scandinavian, and Slavic peoples on the northern portion of the region is very strong; many of these emigrated to Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois in the 19th century to take advantage of jobs in the meatpacking business as well as being homesteaders. Bratwurst is a very common sausage eaten at [[Tailgate party|tailgate parties]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]], [[Chicago Bears]], or [[Detroit Lions]] football teams and is often served boiled in lager beer with sauerkraut, different than many of the recipes currently found in Germany. Polish sausage, in particular a locally invented type of [[kielbasa]], is an essential for sporting events in Chicago: Chicago today has approximately 200,000 speakers of Polish and has had a population of that description for over a hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/January-2013/The-Geography-of-Chicagos-Second-Languages/|title=The Geography of Chicago\u2019s Second Languages|website=Chicagomag.com|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> When Poles came to Chicago and surrounding cities from Europe, they brought with them long ropes of kielbasa, cabbage rolls, and pierogis. Poles that left Poland after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the descendants of earlier immigrants still make all of the above and such comestibles are common in local diners and delis as result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160311/BLOGS09/160319972/take-the-pierogi-the-only-guide-to-polish-delis-youll-ever-need|title=Take the pierogi: The only guide to Polish delis you'll ever need|website=Chicagobusinesss.com|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> Today alongside the pierogi, the sausage is served on a long roll with mustard like a hot dog or as a [[Maxwell Street Polish]], a sandwich that has caramelized onions as an essential ingredient. In Cleveland, the same sausage is served in the form of the [[Polish Boy|Polish boy]]: this is a weird but tasty sandwich made of french fries, spicy barbecue sauce, and coleslaw; unlike cities in the East where the hot dog alone is traditional fans of the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Milwaukee Brewers favor at least two or three different kinds of sausage sold in the little pushcarts outside the stadium; the hot dogs themselves tend to follow the Chicago style, which is loaded with mustard, and pickled vegetables. In Cincinnati, where the [[Cincinnati Reds]] play, the predilection for sausage has a competitor in [[Cincinnati chili]], invented by Macedonian immigrants: this bizarre but tasty dish includes spaghetti as its base, chili with a Mediterranean-inspired spice mix, and cheddar cheese; the chili itself is often a topping for local hot dogs at games.\n\nIn the Midwest and especially Minnesota,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/food/fs/potluck.html|title=Potluck Events: Safe Food is Good Business - EH: Minnesota Department of Health|website=Health.state.mn.us|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> the tradition of the church potluck has become a gathering in which local foods reign, and so it has been since the era of the frontier: pioneers would often need to pool resources together to have a celebration in the 19th century and that simply never changed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/sense-of-place-food-and-cuisin-58653|title=Sense of Place: Food and Cuisine of the Midwest|newspaper=The Kitchn|access-date=November 28, 2016}}</ref> Nowhere is this more clear than with the [[hotdish]]: this is a type of casserole believed to have derived somehow from a Norwegian recipe, and it is usually topped with potatoes or tater tots.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hotdish.htm#didyouknowout|title=What is a Hotdish?

Next to that is the [[Booyah (stew)|booyah]], a thick soup made of a number or combinations of meat, vegetables, and seasonings that is meant to simmer on the stove for up to two days. [[Lefse]], traditionally a Scandinavian flatbread, has been handed down to descendants for over a hundred years and is common on the table. Behind that is the venison, a popular meat around the Great Lakes and often eaten in steaks, sandwiches, and crown roasts for special events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/10/arbys_to_offer_venison_sandwic.html|title=Arby's to offer venison sandwiches at 4 Michigan locations|website=Mlive.com|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2016/11/04/arbys-venison-sandwich-sells-out-fast-in-minnesota-wisconsin/|title=Arby\u2019s venison sandwich sells out fast in Minnesota, Wisconsin|date=November 4, 2016|website=Twincities.com|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> If in North or South Dakota, [[tiger meat]], a dish similar to steak tartare, is present.

A popular chunky stew of the Midwest that is often served to large numbers of people.]]\n\nFurther South, barbecue has its own style in places in Kansas and St. Louis that are different to the South and the American West. Kansas City and St. Louis were and remain important hubs for the railroad that connected the plains with the Great Lakes and cities farther east, like Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trn.trains.com/~/media/images/railroad-reference/railroad-maps/kansas-city-tonnage.png?h=332&la=en&mw=600&w=459|title=Kansas train map|website=Trn.trains.com|accessdate=2017-08-02}}</ref> At the turn of the 19th century, the St. Louis area, Omaha, and Kansas City had huge stockyards, waystations for cattle and pigs on their way East to the cities of the coast and North to the Great Lakes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missourilife.com/life/kansas-city-and-st.-louis-stockyards/|title=Wild West Week: Kansas City and St. Louis Stockyards|date=September 9, 2011|website=Missourilife.com|accessdate=August 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802133633/http://www.missourilife.com/life/kansas-city-and-st.-louis-stockyards/|archive-date=August 2, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.omahapubliclibrary.org/earlyomaha/buildings/stockyards.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510121319/http://digital.omahapubliclibrary.org/earlyomaha/buildings/stockyards.html |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> They all had large growing immigrant and migrant populations from Europe and the South respectively, so this region has developed unique styles of barbecue. [[St. Louis-style barbecue]] favors a heavy emphasis on a sticky sweet barbecue sauce. Its standbys include the [[pork steak]], a cut taken from the shoulder of the pig, grilled, and then slowly stewed in a pan over charcoal, crispy snoots, a cut from the cheek and nose of the pig that is fried up like cracklin and eaten dipped in sauce, pork [[spare ribs]], and a mix of either beer boiled bratwurst or grilled Italian derived sausage, flavored with fennel. Dessert is usually something like [[gooey butter cake]], invented in the city in the 1930s. [[Kansas City-style barbecue]] uses several different kinds of meat, more than most styles of American barbecue- turkey, mutton, pork, and beef just to name a few- but is distinct from St. Louis in that the barbecue sauce adds molasses in with the typical tomato based recipe and typically has a more tart taste. Traditionally, Kansas City uses a low-and-slow method of smoking the meat in addition to just stewing it in the sauce. It also favors using hickory would for smoking and continual watering or layering of the sauce while cooking to form a glaze; with [[burnt ends]] this step is necessary to create the \"bark\" or charred outer layer of the brisket.\n\n===Southern United States===\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Southern United States}}\nWhen referring to the American South as a region, typically it should indicate Southern Maryland and the states that were once part of the [[Confederate States of America|Old Confederacy]], with the dividing line between the East and West jackknifing about 100 miles west of Dallas, Texas, and mostly south of the old [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]]. Cities found in this area include [[New Orleans]], [[Miami]], [[Atlanta]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] with [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] being the largest. These states are much more closely tied to each other and have been part of US territory for much longer than states much farther west than East Texas, and in the case of food, the influences and cooking styles are strictly separated as the terrain begins to change to prairie and desert from bayou and hardwood forest.\n\nThis section of the country has some of the oldest known foodways in the land, with some recipes almost 400 years old. Native American influences are still quite visible in the use of [[cornmeal]] as an essential staple<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmills.com/indian-head-yellow-corn-meal|title=Indian Head Yellow Corn Meal Recipes - Wilkins Rogers Mills|publisher=Wrmills.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> and found in the Southern predilection for hunting wild game, in particular [[wild turkey]], [[white tailed deer|deer]], [[American woodcock|woodcock]], and various kinds of [[waterfowl]]; for example, coastal North Carolina is a place where hunters will seek [[tundra swan]] as a part of Christmas dinner; the original English and Scottish settlers would have rejoiced at this revelation owing to the fact that such was banned amongst the commoner class in what is now the United Kingdom, and naturally, their descendants have not forgotten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdtv.com/wdtv.cfm?func=view&section=5-News&item=Fall-Wild-Turkey-Season-Opens-Oct-11- |title=West Virginia Breaking News, Sports, Weather: WDTV.COM |publisher=Wdtv.com |accessdate=January 16, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deeranddeerhunting.com/blogs/southern-hunting-for-whitetail-deer|title=Southern Deer Hunting|work=Deer & Deer Hunting - Whitetail Deer Hunting Tips|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Native Americans also consumed [[turtle]]s and catfish, specifically the [[snapping turtle]] and [[blue catfish]].

Specific influences from Europe were quite varied, and remain traditional and essential to the modern cookery overall. German speakers often settled in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] on small farms from the coast, and invented an American delicacy that is now nationally beloved, [[apple butter]], based on their recipe for apfelkraut, and later introduced [[red cabbage]] and [[rye]]. From the British Isles, an enormous amount of influence was bestowed upon the South, specifically foodways found in 17th- and 18th-century [[Ulster]], the borderlands between England and Scotland, the [[Scottish Highlands]], portions of [[Wales]], the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[Black Country]]. Settlers bound for America fled the tumult of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], [[Ulster Plantation|Ulster]] and the [[Highland Clearances]]. Often ships' manifests show their belongings nearly always included cookpots or [[bakestone]]s and seed stock for plants like [[peach]]es, [[plum]]s, and [[apple]]s to grow orchards which they planted in their hundreds. Each group brought foods and ideas from their respective regions. \n\nSettlers from Ireland and Scotland were well known for creating [[Peatreek|peatreak]] and [[Poit\u00edn (band)|poit\u00edn]], strong hard liquor based on fermenting potatoes or barley. In time they came up with a method for distilling a corn mash with added sugar and aging in charred barrels made of select hardwoods, which created a whiskey with a high proof. This gave birth to [[American whiskey]] and [[Kentucky bourbon]], and its cousins [[moonshine]] and [[Everclear (alcohol)|Everclear]].\n\nCloser to the coast, 18th-century recipes for English [[trifle]] turned into [[tipsy cake]]s, replacing the sherry with whiskey and their recipe for [[pound cake]], brought to the South around the same time, still works with American baking units: 1 pound sugar, one pound eggs, one pound butter, one pound flour.\n\n====Common features====\nPork is the popular choice for Southern style barbecue and features in other preparations like sausages and sandwiches. For most Southerners in the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era (1781\u20131860)|antebellum period]], corn and pork were staples of the diet.<ref name=\"Warren2007\"/> [[Country sausage]] is an ingredient in the Southern breakfast dish of [[biscuits and gravy]]. [[Country ham]] is often served for breakfast and cured with salt or sugar and hickory-smoked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/458/458-223/458-223.html#|title=Dry Curing Virginia-Style Ham - Publications and Educational Resources - Virginia Tech|date=December 18, 2012|publisher=Oubs.ext.vt.edu|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Accompanying many meals is the southern style fluffy [[biscuit (bread)|biscuit]], where the leavening agent is [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] and often includes [[buttermilk]], and for breakfast they often accompany country ham, grits, and scrambled eggs.\n\n====Desserts====\nDesserts in the South tend to be quite rich and very much a legacy of entertaining to impress guests, since a Southern housewife was (and to a degree still is) expected to show her hospitality by laying out as impressive a banquet as she is able to manage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.timesdispatch.com/entertainment-life/traits-of-a-true-southern-woman/article_37092461-fec6-5a6f-b6fb-72da162d360c.html?mode=jqm|title=Traits of a true Southern woman|work=Richmond.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Desserts are vast and encompass [[Lane cake]], [[sweet potato pie]], [[peach cobbler]], [[pecan pie]], [[hummingbird cake]], [[Jefferson Davis pie]], [[peanut brittle]], [[coconut cake]], [[fritter|apple fritters]], peanut cookies, [[Moravian spice cookies]], [[chess pie]], [[doberge cake]], [[Lady Baltimore cake]], [[bourbon ball]]s, and [[caramel cake]]. American style sponge cakes tend to be the rule rather than the exception as is American style buttercream, a place where Southern baking intersects with the rest of the United States. Nuts like pecan and hickory tend to be revered as garnishes for these desserts, and make their way into local bakeries as fillings for chocolates.\n\n====Cajun cuisine====\n[[File:Shrimp_gumbo.jpg|thumbnail|Shrimp [[gumbo]] is a popular [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] dish.]]\nIn Louisiana, cooking methods have more in common with rustic French cuisines of the 17th and 18th century than anything ever found at the French court in Versailles or the bistros of 19th- and 20th-century Paris; this is especially true of [[Cajun cuisine]]. \n\n[[Cajun French]] is more closely related to dialects spoken in Northern [[Maine]], [[New Brunswick]], and to a lesser degree [[Haiti]] than anything spoken in modern France, and likewise their terminology, methodology, and culture concerning food is much more closely related to the styles of these former French colonies even today. Unlike other areas of the South, Cajuns were and still are largely Catholics and thus much of what they eat is seasonal; for example pork is an important component of the Cajun ''boucherie'' (a large community event where the hog is butchered, prepared with a fiery spice mix, and eaten snout to tail) but it is never consumed in the five weeks of Lent, when such would be forbidden. Cajun cuisine tends to focus on what is locally available, historically because Cajuns were often poor, illiterate, independent farmers and not plantation owners but today it is because such is deeply imbedded in local culture. [[Boudin]] is a type of sausage found only in this area of the country, and it is often by far more spicy than anything found in France or Belgium. [[Chaudin]] is unique to the area, and the method of cooking is comparable to the Scottish dish haggis: the stuffing includes onions, rice, bell peppers, spices, and pork sewn up in the stomach of a pig, and served in slices piping hot. [[Procambarus clarkii|Crayfish]] are a staple of the Cajun grandmother's cookpot, as they are abundant in the bayous of Southern Louisiana and a main source of livelihood, as are [[blue crab]]s, [[shrimp]], corn on the cob, and red potatoes, since these are the basic ingredients of the Louisiana crawfish boil.\n\n[[File:CreoleFood.jpg|thumb|left|Dishes typical of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]]]\nNew Orleans has been the capital of Creole culture since before Louisiana was a state; this culture is that of the colonial French and Spanish that evolved in the city of New Orleans, which was and still is quite distinct from the rural culture of Cajuns and dovetails with what would have been eaten in antebellum Louisiana plantation culture long ago. Cooking to impress and show one's wealth was a staple of Creole culture, which often mixed French, Spanish, Italian, German, African, Caribbean and Native American cooking methods, producing rich dishes like [[Oysters Bienville|oysters bienville]], [[pompano en papillote]], and even the [[muffaletta]] sandwich. However, [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]] tends to diverge from the original ideas brought to the region in ingredients: [[profiterole]]s, for example, use a near identical [[choux pastry]] to that which is found in modern Paris but often use vanilla or chocolate ice cream rather than custard as the filling, [[praline]]s nearly always use [[pecan]] and not almonds, and [[bananas foster]] came about when New Orleans was a key port for the import of bananas from the Caribbean Sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/cuisine/traditionalfoods/bananasfoster.html|title=Bananas Foster|publisher=Neworleansonline.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Gumbos tend to be thickened with [[okra]], or the leaves of the [[sassafras albidum|sassafrass tree]]. Andouille is often used, but not the andouille currently known in France, since French andouille uses tripe whereas Louisiana andouille is made from a [[Boston butt]], usually inflected with pepper flakes, and smoked for hours over pecan wood. Other ingredients that are native to Louisiana and not found in the cuisine of modern France would include rice, which has been a staple of both Creole and Cajun cooking for generations, and sugarcane, which has been grown in Louisiana since the early 1800s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usarice.com/doclib/188/219/3677.PDF |format=PDF |title=Louisiana Rice |publisher=Usarice.com |accessdate=January 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222045727/http://www.usarice.com/doclib/188/219/3677.PDF |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passiflora incarnata 004.JPG|thumbnail|The maypop plant]]\nGround cayenne pepper is a key spice of the region, as is the meat of the [[American alligator]], something settlers learned from the Choctaws and Houma. The maypop plant has been a favorite of Southerners for 350 years; it gives its name to the Ocoee River in Tennessee, a legacy of the Cherokees, and in Southern Louisiana it is known as liane de grenade, indicating its consumption by Cajuns. It is a close relative of the commercial [[passiflora edulis|passionfruit]], similar in size, and is a common plant growing in gardens all over the South as a source of fresh summertime fruit.\n\n====African American influences====\nAfrican American influences came with slaves from [[Ghana]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Nigeria]], and other portions of West Africa, and the mark African Americans and their descendants have made on Southern food is extremely strong today and an essential addition to the Southern table. Crops like [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[sesame seeds]], [[eggplant]], and many different kinds of [[melon]]s were brought with them from West Africa along with the incredibly important introduction of rice to the [[Carolinas]] and later to [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]], whence it became a staple grain of the region and still remains a staple today, found in dishes like [[Hoppin John]], purloo, and [[Charleston red rice]]. Like the poorer indentured servants that came to the South, slaves often got the leftovers of what was slaughtered for the consumption of the master of the plantation and so many recipes had to be adapted for offal, like [[pig's ear (food)|pig's ear]]s and [[fatback]]s<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xhpBsIa5yqEC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=black+slaves+offal|title=What the Slaves Ate|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015|isbn=9780313374975|year=2009}}</ref> though other methods encouraged low and slow methods of cooking to tenderize the tougher cuts of meat, like braising, smoking, and pit roasting, the last of which was a method known to West Africans in the preparation of roasting goat.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Florida cuisine====\nCertain portions of the South often have their own distinct subtypes of cuisine owing to local history and landscape, i.e. [[Cajun cuisine]], Floridian cuisine, for example, has a distinct way of cooking that includes ingredients her other Southern sisters do not use, especially points south of Tampa and Orlando. The Spanish Crown had control of the state until the early 19th century and used the southern tip as an outpost to guard the [[Spanish Main]] beginning in the 1500s, but Florida kept and still maintains ties with the [[Caribbean Sea]], including the [[Bahamas]] [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Jamaica]]. South of Tampa, there are and have been for a long time many speakers of [[Caribbean Spanish]], [[Haitian French]], [[Jamaican Patois]], and [[Haitian Creole]] and each Caribbean culture has a strong hold on cooking methods and spices in Florida. In turn, each mixes and matches with the [[foodways]] of the Seminole tribe and Anglophone settlers. Thus, for almost 200 years, Floridian cooking has had a more tropical flavor than any other Southern state. [[Allspice]], a spice originally from [[Jamaica]], is an ingredient found in spice mixes in summer barbecues along with [[ginger]], [[garlic]], [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], sea salt, and nutmeg; in Floridian cooking this is often a variant of Jamaican jerk spice. Coconuts are grown in the areas surrounding Miami and are shipped in daily through its port for consumption of the milk, meat, and water of the coconut. Bananas are not just the yellow Cavendish variety found in supermarkets across America: in Florida they are available as bananitos, colorados, pl\u00e1tanos, and maduros. The first of these is a tiny miniature banana only about 4-5 inches (10\u201313&nbsp;cm) in length and it is sweet. The second has a red peel and an apple like after taste, and the third and fourth are used as a starch on nearly every Caribbean island as a side dish, baked or fried: all of the above are a staple of Florida outdoor markets when in season and all have been grown in the Caribbean for almost 400 years. Mangoes are grown as a backyard plant in Southern Florida and otherwise are a favorite treat coming in many different shapes in sizes from ''[[Nam Doc Mai]]'', brought to Florida after the Vietnam War, to ''[[Madame Francis]]'', a mango from Haiti. [[Sweetsop]] and [[soursop]] are popular around Miami, but nearly unheard of in other areas of the South.\n\nCitrus is a major crop of Florida, and features at every breakfast table and every market with the height of the season near the first week of January. Hamlin oranges are the main cultivar planted, and from this crop the rest of the United States and to a lesser extent Europe gets orange juice. Other plantings would include [[grapefruits]], [[tangerine]]s, [[clementine|clementine oranges]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]]s, and even a few more rare ones, like [[cara cara navel]]s, [[tangelo]]s, and the Jamaican [[Ugli fruit]]. [[Tomato]]es, [[bell pepper]]s, [[Habanero|habanero peppers]], and figs, especially taken from the [[Ficus aurea|Florida strangler fig]], complete the produce menu. [[Blue crab]], [[Queen conch|conch]], [[Florida stone crab]], [[red drum]], [[common dolphinfish|dorado]], and [[marlin]]s tend to be local favorite ingredients. Dairy is available in this region, but it is less emphasized due to the year round warmth. Traditional [[key lime pie]], a dessert from the islands off the coast of Miami, is made with [[condensed milk]] to form the custard with the eye wateringly tart limes native to the [[Florida Keys]] in part because milk would spoil in an age before refrigeration. Pork in this region tends to be roasted in methods similar to those found in Puerto Rico and Cuba, owing to mass emigration from those countries in the 20th century, especially in the counties surrounding Miami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southfloridagaynews.com/outEATS/pernil-al-horno-roasted-pork-shoulder.html|title=Pernil Al Horno (Roasted Pork Shoulder)|author=Guest Column|work=South Florida Gay News|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Orange blossom honey is a specialty of the state, and is widely available in farmer's markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomashoney.com/honey.html|title=Honey - from Thomas Honey Company|website=Thomashoney.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Other small game====\n[[Ptarmigan]], [[grouse]], [[crow]] blackbirds, dove, ducks and other game fowl are consumed in the United States.

Another instance can be found in the Northwestern region, which encompasses [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and Northern California. All of the aforementioned rely on local seafood and a few classics of their own. In [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[West Texas]], and [[Southern California]], Mexican flavors and influences are extremely common, especially from the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Baja California]], and [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]].\n\n====Northwest====\nThe Pacific Northwest as a region generally includes [[Alaska]] and the state of Washington near the Canada\u2013US border and terminates near [[Sacramento, California]]. Here, the terrain is mostly temperate rainforest on the Coast mixed with pine forest as one approaches the Canada\u2013US border inland. One of the core favorite foodstuffs is [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]], native to many of the larger rivers of the area and often smoked or grilled on cedar planks. In [[Alaska]], wild game like [[Lagopus|ptarmigan]] and [[moose]] meat feature extensively since much of the state is wilderness. Fresh fish like [[Rainbow trout|steelhead trout]], [[Pacific cod]], [[Pacific halibut]], and [[pollock]] are fished for extensively and feature on the menu of many restaurants, as do a plethora of fresh berries and vegetables, like Cameo apples from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state, the headquarters of the U.S. [[apple]] industry, [[cherry|cherries]] from [[Oregon]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], and [[marionberry|marionberries]], a feature of many pies. [[Hazelnut]]s are grown extensively in this region and are a feature of baking, such as in chocolate hazelnut pie, an Oregon favorite,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/mix/index.ssf/dessert-recipes/chocolate_bourbon_hazelnut_pie.html|title=Chocolate Bourbon Hazelnut Pie|publisher=Oregonlive.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> and [[Almond Roca]] is a local candy.\n\nThis region is also heavily dominated by some notable wineries producing a high quality product, with [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma]] found within this region as well as the newer vinicultural juggernauts of Washington State, like the [[Yakima Valley AVA|Yakima Valley]]. The first plantings of vineyards in the United States began many miles to the South on the Pacific coast in what is now [[San Diego]], because the Franciscan friars that settled [[Alta California]] required wines they could use for their table and for the Eucharist, and the variety they planted, the [[Mission (grape)|mission grape]], is still available on a limited basis. Today, French, Spanish, and Italian varietals are sold by the [[hogshead]], and much of the area directly north of San Francisco is under vine, in particular [[Pinot noir]], [[Grenache|Garnacha]], and [[Ruffina]] and several Tuscan varietals.\n\nLike its counterpart on the opposite coast to the East, there is a grand variety of shellfish in this region. [[Geoduck]]s are a native species of giant clam that have incredibly long necks, and they are eaten by the bucket full as well as shipped to Asia for millions of dollars as they are believed to be an [[aphrodisiac]]. [[Tresus|Gaper clams]] are a favorite food, often grilled or steamed in a sauce, as is the native California [[abalone]], which although protected as a food source is a traditional foodway predating settlement by whites and today features heavily in the cooking of fine restaurants as well as in home cooking, in mirin-flavored soups (the influence of Japanese cooking is strong in the region) noodle dishes and on the barbecue. [[Ostrea lurida|Olympia oyster]]s are served on the half shell as well as the [[Pacific oyster|Kumamoto oyster]], introduced by Japanese immigrants and a staple at dinner as an appetizer. [[California mussel]]s are a delicacy of the region, and have been a feature of the cooking for generations: there is evidence that Native American tribes consumed them up and down the California coast for centuries in their masses.\n\nCrabs are a delicacy, and included in this are [[Alaskan king crab]], [[cancer productus|red crab]], [[Metacarcinus anthonyi|yellow crab]], and [[Dungeness crab]]. Californian and Oregonian sportsmen pursue the last three extensively using hoop nets, and prepare them in a multitude of ways. Alaska king crab, able to get up to 10&nbsp;kg, is often served steamed for a whole table with lemon butter sauce or put in chunks of salad with avocado, and native crabs are the base of dishes like the [[California roll]], [[cioppino]], a tomato based fisherman's stew, and [[Crab Louie]], another kind of salad native to San Francisco. Favorite grains are mainly wheat, and the region is known for [[Sourdough|sourdough bread]]. Cheeses of the region include [[Humboldt Fog]], [[Cougar Gold cheese|Cougar Gold]] and [[Teleme cheese|Teleme]].\n\n====Southwest and Southern California====\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Southwestern United States}}\n[[File:Flickr elisart 324248450--Beef and chicken fajitas.jpg|thumb|Mixed beef and chicken [[fajita]] ingredients, served on a hot iron skillet]]\nThe states of the Four Corners ([[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], and [[Utah]]) plus [[Nevada]], [[Southern California]], and [[West Texas]] make up a large chunk of the United States and there is a distinct Hispanic accent to the cookery here, with each having cultural capitals in [[Albuquerque]], [[Denver]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. For centuries, prior to California's statehood in the 1830s, it was part of the [[Spanish Empire]], namely [[Alta California]] (modern [[California]]), [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] (modern [[New Mexico]]), and [[Spanish Texas|Tejas]] (modern [[Texas]]). Today it is home of a large population of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Hispanos]], descendants of the [[American frontier]], [[Asian Americans]], and immigrants from [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]]; California, New Mexico, and Texas continue to hold their unique identities which is reflected in their distinct regional cuisines, the multiple [[Cuisine of California|cuisines of California]], [[New Mexican cuisine]], [[Texan cuisine]], and [[Tex-Mex]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a commonly spoken secondary language here; the state of [[New Mexico]] has its own distinct [[New Mexican Spanish|dialect]].\n\nWith the exception of Southern California, the signature meat is [[beef]], since this is one of the two regions in which cowboys lived and modern cattle ranchers still eke out their living today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/nevada-cattle-rancher-wins-range-war-federal-government/story?id=23302610|title=Nevada Cattle Rancher Wins 'Range War' With Federal Government - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utahcattlemen.org |title=Welcome to the Utah Cattlemen's Association |publisher=Utahcattlemen.org |accessdate=January 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218091907/https://utahcattlemen.org/ |archivedate=December 18, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> High quality beefstock is a feature that has been present in the region for more than 200 years and the many cuts of beef are unique to the United States. These cuts of meat are different from the related Mexican cuisine over the border in that certain kind of offal, like ''lengua'' (tongue) ''cabeza'' (head) and ''tripas'' (tripe) are considered less desirable and are thus less emphasized. Typical cuts would include the ribs, brisket, sirloin, flank steak, skirt steak, and t-bone.\n\n[[File:Chili with garnishes and tortilla chips.jpg|thumb|[[Chili con carne]], a typical Tex-Mex dish with garnishes and tortilla chips]]\nHistorically, Spanish settlers that came to the region found it completely unsuitable to the mining operations that much older settlements in [[Mexico]] had to offer as the technology of the age was not yet advanced enough to get at the silver that would later be found in the region. They had no knowledge of the gold to be discovered in California, something nobody would find until 1848, and knew even less about the silver in Nevada, something nobody would find until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Instead, in order to make the pueblos prosper, they adapted the old rancho system of places like [[Andalusia]] in [[Spain]] and brought the earliest beefstock, among these were breeds that would go feral and become the [[Texas longhorn]], and [[Navajo-Churro sheep]], still used as breeding stock because they are easy to keep and well adapted to the extremely arid and hot climate, where temperatures easily exceed 38&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doublehelixranch.com/History.html|title=History of Texas Longhorns|author=David Hillis|publisher=Doublehelixranch.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Later, cowboys learned from their management practices, many of which still stand today, like the practical management of stock on horseback using the [[Western saddle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid=3573|title=Digital History|publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fresh batch of Biscochitos, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|[[Biscochitos]], the [[List of New Mexico state symbols#food|state cookie]] of [[New Mexico]]]]\nLikewise, settlers learned the cooking methods of those who came before and local tribes as well: for example, portions of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] still use the aforementioned beehive shaped clay contraption called an ''[[horno]]'', an outdoor wood fired oven both Native American tribes like the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and Spaniards used for roasting meat, maize, and baking bread.<ref>Green, Rayna (1999).

Chili peppers play an important role in the cuisine, with a few native to the region (such as the [[New Mexico chile]] pepper, knows as [[Hatch, New Mexico]] and [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]); these still grown by [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] and [[Pueblo]]. In New Mexico, chile is eaten on a variety of foods, such as the green chile cheeseburger, made popular by fast food chains such as [[Blake's Lotaburger]]. Indeed, even national fast food chains operating in the state, such as [[McDonald's]], offer locally grown chile on many of their menu items. In the 20th century a few more recent additions have arrived like the [[poblano pepper]], [[Capsicum pubescens|rocoto pepper]], [[ghost pepper]], [[thai chili pepper]], and Korean pepper, the last three especially when discussing Southern California and its large population from East and South Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/chili.html|title=Chilis & Other Peppers|publisher=Clovegarden.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/23/food/fo-calcook23|title=New Mexico's green chile, the real deal|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> [[Cornbread]] is consumed in this area, however the recipe differs from ones in the East in that the batter is cooked in a cast iron skillet. Outdoor cooking is popular and still utilizes an old method settlers brought from the East with them, in which a cast iron [[dutch oven]] is covered with the coals of the fire and stacked or hung from a tripod: this is different from the earthenware pots of Mexico. Tortillas are still made the traditional way in this area and form an important component of the spicy [[breakfast burrito]], which contains ham, eggs, and salsa or [[pico de gallo]]. They also comprise the regular [[burrito]], which contains any combination of marinated meats, vegetables, and piquant chilis; The smothered burrito, often both containing and topped with New Mexico chile sauces; the [[quesadilla]], a much loved grilled dish where cheese and other ingredients are stuffed between two tortillas and served by the slice, and the steak [[fajita]], where sliced skirt steak sizzles in a skillet with caramelized onions.\n\n[[File:Goettanachos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nachos]] with cheese]]\nUnlike Mexico, tortillas of this region also may incorporate vegetable matter like spinach into the flatbread dough to make [[wrap (sandwich)|wraps]], which were invented in Southern California. Food here tends to use pungent spices and condiments, typically chili verde sauce, various kinds of [[hot sauce]], [[sriracha sauce]], [[chili powder]], [[cayenne pepper]], [[white pepper]], [[cumin]], [[paprika]], [[onion powder]], [[thyme]] and [[black pepper]]. Nowhere is this fiery mix of spice more evident than in the dishes [[chili con carne]], a meaty stew, and [[cowboy beans]], both of which are a feature of regional cookoffs. Southern California has several additions like [[five spice powder]], [[rosemary]], [[curry powder]], [[kimchi]], and [[lemongrass]], with many of these brought by recent immigration to the region and often a feature of Southern California's fusion cuisine, popular in fine dining.\n\nIn Texas, the local barbecue is often entirely made up of beef [[brisket]] or large rib racks, where the meat is seasoned with a [[spice rub]] and cooked over coals of [[mesquite]], and in other portions of the state they smoke their meat and peppery sausages over high heat using [[pecan]], [[apple]], and [[oak]] and served it with a side of pickled vegetables, a legacy of German and Czech settlers of the late 1800s. California is home to [[Santa Maria-style barbecue]], where the spices involved generally are [[black pepper]], [[paprika]], and [[garlic salt]], and grilled over the coals of [[coast live oak]].\n\n[[File:Chimichanga in Bremen 7095.JPG|thumb|A [[chimichanga]]]]\nNative American additions may include [[Frybread|Navajo frybread]] and [[corn on the cob]], often roasted on the grill in its husk. A typical accompaniment or appetizer of all these states is the tortilla chip, which sometimes includes cornmeal from cultivars of corn that are blue or red in addition to the standard yellow of sweetcorn, and is served with [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]] of varying hotness. Tortilla chips also are an ingredient in the Tex Mex dish [[nacho]]s, where these chips are loaded with any combination of ground beef, melted Monterey Jack, cheddar, or Colby cheese, [[guacamole]], [[sour cream]], and salsa, and Texas usually prefers a version of [[potato salad]] as a side dish. For alcohol, a key ingredient is [[tequila]]: this spirit has been made on both sides of the US-Mexican border for generations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/tequila/18-19th%20centuries.htm|title=In Search of the Blue Agave: Tequila History - 18th-19th Centuries|publisher=Ianchadwick.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> and in modern cuisine it is a must have in a bartender's arsenal as well as an addition to dishes for sauteeing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.closetcooking.com/2008/06/tequila-lime-shrimp.html?m=1|title=Closet Cooking: Tequila Lime Shrimp|work=Closet Cooking|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSouthern California is located more towards the coast and has had more contact with immigration from the [[West Pacific]] and [[Baja California]], in addition to having the international city of [[Los Angeles]] as its capital. Here, the prime mode of transportation is by car. Drive through fast food was invented in this area, but so was the concept of the gourmet burger movement, giving birth to chains like [[In and Out Burger]], with many variations of burgers including chili, multiple patties, avocado, special sauces, and angus or wagyu beef; common accompaniments include thick milkshakes in various flavors like mint, chocolate, peanut butter, vanilla, strawberry, and mango. Smoothies are a common breakfast item made with fresh fruit juice, yogurt, and crushed ice. Agua fresca, a drink originated by Mexican immigrants, is a common hot weather beverage sold in many supermarkets and at mom and pop stands, available in citrus, watermelon, and strawberry flavors; the California version usually served chilled without grain in it. \n\n[[File:Pork_machaca_with_eggs,_served_with_potatoes_and_salsa_and_wrapped_in_a_tortilla-_2013-04-07_13-31.jpg|thumbnail|[[Machaca]] with pork, eggs, and potatoes wrapped in a tortilla, served with salsa]]\nThe weather in Southern California is such that the temperature rarely drops below 12&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter, thus, sun loving crops like [[pistachio]]s, [[kiwifruit]], [[avocado]]es, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], and [[tomato]]es are staple crops of the region, the last often dried in the sun and a feature of salads and sandwiches. [[Olive oil]] is a staple cooking oil of the region and has been since the days of [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]]; today the [[mission olive]] is a common tree growing in a Southern Californian's back garden; as a crop olives are increasingly a signature of the region along with [[Valencia orange]]s and [[Meyer lemon]]s. [[Soybean]]s, [[bok choy]], [[Diospyros kaki|Japanese persimmon]], [[thai basil]], [[Napa cabbage]], [[nori]], [[mandarin orange]]s, [[water chestnut]]s, and [[mung bean]]s are other crops brought to the region from East Asia and are common additions to salads as the emphasis on fresh produce in both Southern and Northern California is strong. Other vegetables and herbs have a distinct Mediterranean flavor which would include [[oregano]], [[basil]], [[summer squash]], [[eggplant]], and [[broccoli]], with all of the above extensively available at farmers' markets all around Southern California. Naturally, salads native to Southern California tend to be hearty affairs, like [[Cobb salad]] and [[Chinese chicken salad]], and dressings like [[Green goddess dressing|green goddess]] and [[ranch dressing|ranch]] are a staple. [[California-style pizza]] tends to have disparate ingredients with an emphasis on vegetables, with any combination of chili oil, prawns, eggs, chicken, shiitake mushrooms, olives, bell pepper, goat cheese, and feta cheese. Peanut noodles tend to include a sweet dressing with lo mein noodles and chopped peanuts.\n\nFresh fish and shellfish in Southern California tends to be expensive in restaurants, but every year since the end of WWII, the Pismo clam festival has taken place where the local population takes a [[pismo clam|large species of clam]] and bakes, stuffs, and roasts it as it is a regional delicacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sandiegoreader.com/news/2013/apr/12/digging-pismo-clams-san-diego-beaches/?templates=mobile|title=Digging for Pismo clams at San Diego Beaches - San Diego Reader|publisher=Sandiegoreader.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seacrestpismo.com/2012/10/pismo-beach-clam-festival/|title=Dig Into the 66th Annual Pismo Beach Clam Festival|work=SeaCrest OceanFront Hotel|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Fishing for pacific species of octopus and the [[Humboldt squid]] are common, and both are a feature of East Asian and other L.A. fish markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/14/local/la-me-fishing-boat-20130114|title=Jumbo squid invasion attracts eager anglers|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wideopenfish.com/2011/09/cooking-the-monster-giant-squid-made-easy/|title=Cooking the Monster Giant Squid Made Easy!|work=Wide Open Fishing Los Angeles Orange County Inshore Offshore Fishing|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.laweekly.com/squidink/2013/05/15/10-best-octopus-dishes-in-los-angeles|title=10 Best Octopus Dishes in Los Angeles|work=LA Weekly|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>[[Lingcod]] is a coveted regional fish that is often caught in the autumn off the coast of [[San Diego]] and in the [[Channel Islands, California|Channel Islands]] and often served baked.

As a result, [[Hawaii regional cuisine|Hawaiian cuisine]] borrows elements of a variety of cuisines, particularly those of Asian and Pacific-rim cultures, as well as traditional native Hawaiian and a few additions from the American mainland. American influence of the last 150 years has brought cattle, goats, and sheep to the islands, introducing cheese, butter, and yogurt products, as well as crops like [[red cabbage]]. Just to name a few, major Asian and Polynesian influences on modern Hawaiian cuisine are from [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[China]] (especially near the Pearl River delta,) [[Samoa]], and the [[Philippines]]. From Japan, the concept of serving raw fish as a meal with rice was introduced, as was soft tofu, setting the stage for the popular dish called [[Poke (Hawaii)|poke.]] From Korea, immigrants to Hawaii brought a love of spicy garlic marinades for meat and [[kimchi]]. From China, their version of [[char siu baau]] became modern [[manapua]], a type of steamed pork bun with a spicy filling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coffeetimes.com/may97.htm|title=Getting to the Roots of Hawaii Regional Cuisine|publisher=Coffeetimes.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Filipinos brought vinegar, [[bagoong]], and [[lumpia]], and during the 20th century immigrants from [[American Samoa]] brought the open pit fire [[Earth oven|umu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polynesia.com/Umu_Making_Release.html#.VH5chJY8Lv4|title=Polynesian Cultural Center Shares The Flavors Of Samoa With Hands-On Umu Making Activity|publisher=Polynesia.com|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> and the Vietnamese introduced [[lemongrass]] and [[fish sauce]]. Each East Asian culture brought several different kinds of noodles, including [[udon]], [[ramen]], [[mei fun]], and [[pho]], and today these are common lunchtime meals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danazia.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/history-of-hawaiis-cuisine/|title=History of Hawaii's cuisine - The Go Lightly Gourmet|work=The Go Lightly Gourmet|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this cuisine mixes and melts into traditions like the [[luau|lu'au]], whose traditional elaborate fare was once the prerogative of kings and queens but today is the subject of parties for both tourists and also private parties for the ''\u2018ohana'' (meaning family and close friends.) Traditionally, women and men ate separately under the Hawaiian ''[[kapu]]'' system, a system of religious beliefs that honored the Hawaiian gods similar to the [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] tapu system, though in this case had some specific prohibitions towards females eating things like coconut, pork, turtle meat, and bananas as these were considered parts of the male gods. Punishment for violation could be severe, as a woman might endanger a man's mana, or soul, by eating with him or otherwise by eating the forbidden food because doing so dishonored all the male gods. As the system broke down after 1810, introductions of foods from laborers on plantations began to be included at feasts and much cross pollination occurred, where Asian foodstuffs mixed with Polynesian foodstuffs like [[breadfruit]], [[Aleurites moluccanus|kukui nuts]], and purple [[sweet potato]]es.\n\nSome notable Hawaiian fare includes seared ahi tuna, opakapaka (snapper) with passionfruit, Hawaiian island-raised lamb, beef and meat products, Hawaiian [[plate lunch]], and Molokai shrimp. Seafood traditionally is caught fresh in Hawaiian waters, and particular delicacies are [[Panulirus marginatus|''ula poni'']], [[Kona crab|''papaikualoa'']], [[Cellana|''\u2018opihi'']], and [[haliotis discus|''\u2018opihi malihini'']], better known as Hawaiian spiny lobster, Kona crab, Hawaiian limpet, and abalone, the last brought over with Japanese immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honolulupulse.com/2014/02/food-la-la-kona-abalone/|title=Food La La: Kona Abalone opens at Ala Moana - Honolulu Pulse - Hawaii Entertainment, Food and NightlifeHonolulu Pulse \u2013 Hawaii Entertainment, Food and Nightlife|work=Honolulu Pulse - Hawaii Entertainment, Food and Nightlife|accessdate=January 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116202330/http://www.honolulupulse.com/2014/02/food-la-la-kona-abalone/|archive-date=January 16, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some cuisine also incorporates a broad variety of produce and locally grown agricultural products, including [[tomato]]es, sweet Maui onions, taro, and macadamia nuts. Tropical fruits equally play an important role in the cuisine as a flavoring in cocktails and in desserts, including local cultivars of [[banana]]s, [[sweetsop]], [[mango]]es, [[lychee]], [[coconut]]s, [[papaya]]s, and lilikoi ([[passiflora edulis|passionfruit]]). [[Pineapple]]s have been an island staple since the 19th century and figure into many marinades and drinks.\n\n===Common dishes found on a regional level===\n{{See also|List of American regional and fusion cuisines}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"170px\"> \nFile:BBQ Food.jpg|Chicken, pork and corn cooking in a [[barbecue]] [[smoking (cooking)|smoker]]\nFile: New_York-Style_Pizza.png|[[New York\u2013style pizza]] served at a pizzeria in New York City\nFile:Giordanos stuffed pizza.jpg|[[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago-style deep-dish pizza]] from the original [[Giordano's]] location\n</gallery>\n\n==Ethnic and immigrant influence==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2008}}\n[[File:Fried Fish and French Fries.jpg|thumb|[[Fried fish]] and [[french fries]] in [[San Diego]], California]]\n\nThe demand for ethnic foods in the United States reflects the nation's changing diversity as well as its development over time. According to the [[National Restaurant Association]], <blockquote>\nRestaurant industry sales are expected to reach a record high of $476 billion in 2005, an increase of 4.9 percent over 2004... Driven by consumer demand, the ethnic food market reached record sales in 2002, and has emerged as the fastest growing category in the food and beverage product sector, according to USBX Advisory Services. Minorities in the U.S. spend a combined $142 billion on food and by 2010, America's ethnic population is expected to grow by 40 percent.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Oralia|2005}} (par. 6).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA movement began during the 1980s among popular leading chefs to reclaim America's ethnic foods within its regional traditions, where these trends originated. One of the earliest was [[Paul Prudhomme]], who in 1984 began the introduction of his influential cookbook, ''Paul Prodhomme's Louisiana Kitchen'', by describing the over 200-year history of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and Cajun cooking; he aims to \"preserve and expand the Louisiana tradition.\"<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Prodhomme|1984}} n.p.</ref> Prodhomme's success quickly inspired other chefs. Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his ''Feast of Sunlight'' cookbook in 1988. California became swept up in the movement, then seemingly started to lead the trend itself, in, for example, the popular restaurant [[Chez Panisse]] in Berkeley. Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon, chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine, were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and [[Wolfgang Puck]], both former colleagues at the restaurant. Puck went on to describe his belief in contemporary, new style American cuisine in the introduction to ''The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook'':\n<blockquote>\nAnother major breakthrough, whose originators were once thought to be crazy, is the mixing of ethnic cuisines. It is not at all uncommon to find raw fish listed next to tortillas on the same menu. Ethnic crossovers also occur when distinct elements meet in a single recipe. This country is, after all, a huge melting pot. Why should its cooking not illustrate the American transformation of diversity into unity?<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Puck|1986}} n.p.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPuck's former colleague, Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with [[California Cuisine]] and the overall American [[culinary revolution]]. Meanwhile, the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a distinguished establishment, popularizing its so called \"mantra\" in its book by [[Paul Bertolli]] and owner [[Alice Waters]], ''Chez Panisse Cooking'', in 1988. Published well after the restaurants' founding in 1971, this new cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy that had developed over the years. The book embraced America's natural bounty, specifically that of California, while containing recipes that reflected Bertoli and Waters' appreciation of both northern Italian and French style foods.\n\n===Early ethnic influences===\n[[File:CornmealProducts.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of [[Mexican food]] tailored for the mainstream American market usually is different from [[Mexican food]] typically served in Mexico.]]\nWhile the earliest cuisine of the United States was influenced by [[Native American cuisine|Native Americans]], the [[Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]], or the [[Cuisine of Antebellum America|antebellum South]]; the overall culture of the nation, its [[gastronomy]] and the growing [[culinary arts]] became ever more influenced by its changing [[ethnic]] mix and [[immigrant]] patterns from the 18th and 19th centuries unto the present. Some of the ethnic groups that continued to influence the cuisine were here in prior years; while others arrived more numerously during \"The Great [[Transatlantic Migration]]\" (of 1870\u20141914) or other [[mass migration]]s.\n\nSome of the ethnic influences could be found across the nation after the [[American Civil War]] and into the [[History of United States continental expansion|continental expansion]] for most of the 19th century. Ethnic influences already in the nation at that time would include the following groups and their respective cuisines:\n*Select nationalities of Europe and the respective developments from [[early modern European cuisine]] of the colonial age:\n**[[British-American]]s and on-going developments in [[New England cuisine]], the national traditions founded in cuisine of the thirteen colonies and some aspects of other regional cuisine.\n**[[Spanish American]]s and early modern [[Spanish cuisine]], as well as [[Basque-American]]s and [[Basque cuisine]].\n**Early [[German-American]] or [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine]]\n**[[French American]]s and their [[New World]] regional identities such as:\n***[[Acadian]]\n***[[Cajun]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]\n**[[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]. Louisiana Creole (also called French Cr\u00e9ole) refers to native born people of the New Orleans area who are descended from the Colonial French and Spanish settlers of Colonial French Louisiana, before it became part of the United States in 1803 with the [[Louisiana Purchase]].\n*The various ethnicities originating from early social factors of [[Race in the United States]] and the [[gastronomy]] and [[cuisine]]s of the [[New World]], [[Latin American cuisine]] and North American cuisine:\n**[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[Native American cuisine|American Indian cuisine]]\n**[[African Americans]] and [[Soul food]].\n** [[Puerto Rican cuisine]]\n**[[Mexican Americans]] and Mexican-American cuisine; as well as related regional cuisines:\n***[[Tex-Mex]] (regional Texas and Mexican fusion)\n***Cal-Mex (regional California and Mexican fusion)\n***[[Tex-Jex]] (regional Texas, Jewish and Mexican fusion)\n***Some aspects of \"[[Southwestern cuisine]].\"\n**[[New Mexican cuisine|Cuisine of New Mexico]]\n\n===Later ethnic and immigrant influence===\n{{Main|Immigration to the United States}}\nMass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several waves. Historians identify several waves of migration to the United States: one from 1815 to 1860, in which some five million [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Scandinavia]]n, and others from [[northwestern Europe]] came to the United States; one from 1865 to 1890, in which some 10 million immigrants, also mainly from northwestern Europe, settled, and a third from 1890 to 1914, in which 15 million immigrants, mainly from [[Central Europe|central]], [[Eastern Europe|eastern]], and [[southern Europe]] (many [[Austrian people|Austrian]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Jewish people|Jewish]], [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Italian people|Italian]], and [[Romanian people|Romanian]]) settled in the United States.<ref>[http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture08.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313201141/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture08.html|date=March 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTogether with earlier arrivals to the United States (including the indigenous Native Americans, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], particularly in the [[Western United States|West]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and [[Texas]]; [[African American]]s who came to the United States in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]; and early colonial migrants from Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere), these new waves of immigrants had a profound impact on national or regional cuisine.

These three cuisines have become so ingrained in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate. According to the study, more than nine out of 10 consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods, and about half report eating them frequently. The research also indicates that Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) have become so adapted to such an extent that \"authenticity\" is no longer a concern to customers.<ref>Hensley, Sue, ''National Restaurant Association.''Article/ News Release, \"International Cuisine Reaches America's Main Street,\" 10 August 2000.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nContributions from these ethnic foods have become as common as traditional \"American\" fares such as hot dogs, hamburgers, beef [[steak]], which are derived from [[German cuisine]], ([[chicken-fried steak]], for example, is a variation on German [[schnitzel]]), cherry pie, [[Coca-Cola]], [[milkshake]]s, fried chicken (Fried chicken is of [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish]] and [[African cuisine|African]] influence) and so on. Nowadays, Americans also have a ubiquitous consumption of foods like [[pizza]] and [[pasta]], [[taco]]s and [[burrito]]s to \"[[General Tso's chicken]]\" and [[fortune cookie]]s. Fascination with these and other ethnic foods may also vary with region.\n\n==Notable American chefs==\n{{see also|List of chefs}}\nAmerican [[chef]]s have been influential both in the food industry and in popular culture. An important 19th-century American chef was [[Charles Ranhofer]] of [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] in [[New York City]]. American cooking has been exported around the world, both through the global expansion of restaurant chains such as [[T.G.I. Friday's]] and [[McDonald's]] and the efforts of individual restaurateurs such as Bob Payton, credited with bringing American-style pizza to the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bob Payton, 50, Restaurateur, Dies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 16, 1994|page=28|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10611FF355B0C758DDDAE0894DC494D81|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first generation of television chefs such as [[Robert Carrier (chef)|Robert Carrier]] and [[Julia Child]] tended to concentrate on cooking based primarily on European, especially French and Italian, cuisines. Only during the 1970s and 1980s did television chefs such as [[James Beard]] and [[Jeff Smith (chef)|Jeff Smith]] shift the focus towards home-grown cooking styles, particularly those of the different ethnic groups within the nation.

The second phase was \"active defense\" of the Panjshir stronghold, while carrying out [[asymmetric warfare]].

In 1982, the Soviets began deploying major combat units in the Panjshir, numbering up to 30,000 men. Massoud pulled his troops back into subsidiary valleys, where they occupied fortified positions. When the Soviet columns advanced onto these positions, they fell into ambushes. When the Soviets withdrew, Afghan army garrisons took over their positions. Massoud and his mujahideen forces attacked and recaptured them one by one.<ref>Roy, p.199.</ref>\n\nIn 1983, the Soviets offered Massoud a temporary truce, which he accepted in order to rebuild his own forces and give the civilian population a break from Soviet attacks. He put the respite to good use. In this time he created the [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Supervisory Council), which subsequently united 130 commanders from 12 Afghan provinces in their fight against the Soviet army. This council existed outside the Peshawar parties, which were prone to internecine rivalry and bickering, and served to smooth out differences between resistance groups, due to political and ethnic divisions. It was the predecessor of what could have become a unified Islamic Afghan army.<ref>Barry, Michael (2002). ''Massoud, de l'islamisme \u00e0 la libert\u00e9'', p. 216.

The Panjshir was divided into 22 bases (''qarargah'') governed by a military commander and a civilian administrator, and each had a judge, a prosecutor and a [[public defender]].<ref>Davies, L. Will; Shariat, Abdullah (2004). ''Fighting Masoud's War'', Melbourne: Lothian, p. 200. {{ISBN|0-7344-0590-1}}</ref> Massoud's policies were implemented by different committees: an economic committee was charged with funding the war effort. The health committee provided health services, assisted by volunteers from foreign [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as [[Aide m\u00e9dicale internationale]]. An education committee was charged with the training of the military and administrative [[En cadre|cadre]]. A culture committee and a judiciary committee were also created.<ref>Barry, p.194.</ref>\n\nThis expansion prompted [[Babrak Karmal]] to demand that the Red Army resume their offensives, in order to crush the Panjshir groups. However, Massoud had received warning of the attack through his intelligence agents in the government and he evacuated all 130,000 inhabitants from the valley into the Hindukush mountains, leaving the Soviet bombings to fall on empty ground and the Soviet battalions to face the mountains.<ref>Roy, p. 201.</ref>\n\nWith the defeat of the Soviet-Afghan attacks, Massoud carried out the next phase of his strategic plan, expanding the resistance movement and liberating the northern provinces of Afghanistan. In August 1986, he captured [[Farkhar District|Farkhar]] in [[Takhar Province]]. In November 1986, his forces overran the headquarters of the government's 20th division at Nahrin in [[Baghlan Province]], scoring an important victory for the resistance.<ref>Roy, p.213.</ref> This expansion was also carried out through diplomatic means, as more mujahideen commanders were persuaded to adopt the Panjshir military system.\n\nDespite almost constant attacks by the Red Army and the Afghan army, Massoud increased his military strength. Starting in 1980 with a force of less than 1,000 ill-equipped guerrillas, the Panjshir valley mujahideen grew to a 5,000-strong force by 1984.<ref name=\"Iyer\" /> After expanding his influence outside the valley, Massoud increased his resistance forces to 13,000 fighters by 1989.<ref>Isby, p.98.</ref> These forces were divided into different types of units: the locals (mahalli) were tasked with static defense of villages and fortified positions. The best of the mahalli were formed into units called grup-i zarbati (shock troops), semi-mobile groups that acted as [[Military reserve|reserve]] forces for the defense of several strongholds. A different type of unit was the mobile group (grup-i-mutaharek), a lightly equipped [[commando]]-like formation numbering 33 men, whose mission was to carry out [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] attacks outside the Panjshir, sometimes as far as 100&nbsp;km from their base. These men were professional soldiers, well-paid and trained, and, from 1983 on, they provided an effective strike force against government outposts. Uniquely among the mujahideen, these groups wore uniforms, and their use of the ''[[pakul]]'' made this headwear emblematic of the Afghan resistance.\n\nMassoud's military organization was an effective compromise between the traditional Afghan method of warfare and the modern principles of guerrilla warfare which he had learned from the works of [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Che Guevara]]. His forces were considered the most effective of all the various Afghan resistance movements.<ref>Roy, p.202.</ref>\n\nThe United States provided Massoud with comparatively less support than other factions.<ref name=\"phillips\" /> Part of the reason was that it permitted its funding and arms distribution to be administered by Pakistan, which favored the rival mujahideen leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In an interview, Massoud said, \"We thought the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] knew everything. But they didn't. They supported some bad people [meaning Hekmatyar].\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Primary advocates for supporting Massoud were the US [[State Department]]'s [[Edmund McWilliams]] and [[Peter Tomsen]], who were on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In 1989, after describing the Soviet Union's military engagement in Afghanistan \"a bleeding wound\", Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began a withdrawal of Soviet troops from the nation. On February 15, 1989, in what was depicted as an improbable victory for the mujahideen, the last Soviet soldier left the nation.\n\n===Fall of the Afghan communist regime (1992)===\n{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989\u20131992)}}\n\nAfter the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|departure of Soviet troops]] in 1989, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] regime, then headed by [[Mohammad Najibullah]], held its own against the mujahideen. Backed by a massive influx of weapons from the Soviet Union, the Afghan armed forces reached a level of performance they had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. They maintained control over all of Afghanistan's major cities. By 1992, however, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the regime began to crumble. Food and fuel shortages undermined the capacities of the government's army, and a resurgence of factionalism split the regime between [[Khalq]] and [[Parcham]] supporters.<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0120)|title=''The Fall of Kabul, April 1992''|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA few days after Najibullah had lost control of the nation, his army commanders and governors arranged to turn over authority to resistance commanders and local warlords throughout the country. Joint councils (''shuras'') were immediately established for local government, in which civil and military officials of the former government were usually included. In many cases, prior arrangements for transferring regional and local authority had been made between foes.<ref name=\"LoC\" />\n\nCollusions between military leaders quickly brought down the Kabul government. In mid-January 1992, within three weeks of the demise of the Soviet Union, Massoud was aware of conflict within the government's northern command. General [[Abdul Momim]], in charge of the [[Hairatan]] border crossing at the northern end of Kabul's supply highway, and other non-[[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] generals based in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], feared removal by Najibullah and replacement by Pashtun officers. When the generals rebelled, [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], who held [[General Officer|general rank]] as head of the [[Jowzjan]]i militia, also based in Mazar-i-Sharif, took over.\n\nHe and Massoud reached a political agreement, together with another major militia leader, Sayyed Mansour, of the [[Ismaili]] community based in Baghlan Province. These northern allies consolidated their position in Mazar-i-Sharif on March 21. Their coalition covered nine provinces in the north and northeast. As turmoil developed within the government in Kabul, no government force stood between the northern allies and the major [[Bagram Air Base|air force base at Bagram]], some seventy kilometers north of Kabul. By mid-April 1992, the Afghan air force command at Bagram had capitulated to Massoud.<ref name=\"LoC\" /> On March 18, 1992, Najibullah announced he would resign. On April 17, as his government fell, he tried to escape but was stopped at [[Kabul Airport]] by Dostum's forces. He took refuge at the United Nations mission, where he remained unharmed until 1996, while Massoud controlled the area surrounding the mission.\n\nSenior communist generals and officials of the Najibullah administration acted as a transitional authority to transfer power to Ahmad Shah Massoud's alliance.<ref name=\"Library of Congress Country Studies\">{{cite web|date=|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0120%29|title=The Fall of Kabul, April 1992|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Library of Congress Country Studies (2)\">{{cite web|date=|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0121%29|title=The United Nations Plan for Political Accommodation|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> The Kabul interim authority invited Massoud to enter Kabul as the new Head of State, but he held back.<ref name=\"Roy Gutman\">{{Cite book|last=Roy Gutman|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |page=34|publisher=Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}</ref> Massoud ordered his forces, positioned to the north of Kabul, not to enter the capital until a political solution was in place.<ref name=\"Roy Gutman (2)\">{{Cite book|last=Roy Gutman|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |pages=|publisher=Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} He called on all the senior Afghan party leaders, many then based in exile in [[Peshawar]], to work out a political settlement acceptable to all sides and parties.<ref name=\"Amin Saikal\">{{Cite book|last=Amin Saikal |authorlink=Amin Saikal|title=Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=214|publisher=I.B.

In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage in favour of the women to make their own choice.<ref name=\"Grad\"/>\n\nWhile it was Massoud's stated personal conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion, that could only be achieved through education.<ref name=\"Grad\"/> Author Pepe Escobar wrote in ''Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'':\n\n{{quote|Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that \"the cultural environment of the country suffocates women.

That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day.\"<ref name=\"Grad\"/> This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-Jos\u00e9 Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask the Jewish [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Professor Michael Barry or his Christian friend Jean-Jos\u00e9 Puig: \"Jean-Jos\u00e9, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language.\"<ref name=\"Grad\"/>\n\n====International relations====\nU.S. policy regarding Massoud, the Taliban and Afghanistan remained ambiguous and differed between the various U.S. government agencies.\n\nIn 1997, U.S. State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] suggested to Massoud he should surrender to the Taliban. He soundly rejected the proposal.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAt one point in the war, in 1997, two top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan in an attempt to convince Massoud not to take advantage of a strategic opportunity to make crucial gains against the Taliban.<ref name=\"U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher\">{{cite web |year=2004 |url=http://rohrabacher.house.gov/911-represented-dramatic-failure-policy-and-people|title=9/11 Represented a Dramatic Failure of Policy and People |publisher=U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn 1998, a U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] analyst, Julie Sirrs, visited Massoud's territories privately, having previously been denied official permission to do so by her agency. She reported that Massoud had conveyed warnings about strengthened ties between the Taliban and foreign Islamist terrorists. Returning home, she was sacked from her agency for insubordination, because at that time the U.S. administration had no trust in Massoud.<ref name=\"U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, the only collaboration between Massoud and another U.S. intelligence service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), consisted of an effort to trace [[Osama bin Laden]] following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]].<ref name=\"risen\">Risen, James. ''State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration'', 2006</ref> The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.\n\nA change of policy, lobbied for by CIA officers on the ground who had visited the area of Massoud, regarding support to Massoud, was underway in the course of 2001. According to Steve Coll's book ''Ghost Wars''<ref name=\"Steve Coll: Ghost Wars\" /> (who won the 2005 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]]):\n\n{{quote|The CIA officers admired Massoud greatly. They saw him as a [[Che Guevara]] figure, a great actor on history's stage. Massoud was a poet, a military genius, a religious man, and a leader of enormous courage who defied death and accepted its inevitability, they thought. ... In his house there were thousands of books: Persian poetry, histories of the Afghan war in multiple languages, biographies of other military and guerilla leaders. In their meetings Massoud wove sophisticated, measured references to Afghan history and global politics into his arguments. He was quiet, forceful, reserved, and full of dignity, but also light in spirit. The CIA team had gone into the Panshjir as unabashed admirers of Massoud. Now their convictions deepened.<ref name=\"Steve Coll: Ghost Wars\"/> |[[Steve Coll]]|in ''Ghost Wars''}}\n\nU.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher also recalled:\n\n<blockquote>[B]etween Bush's inauguration and 9/11, I met with the new national security staff on 3 occasions, including one meeting with Condoleezza Rice to discuss Afghanistan.

They were finally granted an interview. During the interview, they set off a bomb composed of explosives hidden in the camera and in a battery-pack belt. Commander Massoud died in a helicopter that was taking him to an [[Farkhor Air Base|Indian military field hospital]] at [[Farkhor]] in nearby Tajikistan.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\"/> The explosion also killed Mohammed Asim Suhail, a United Front official, while [[Mohammad Fahim Dashty]] and [[Massoud Khalili]] were injured.

On September 16, the United Front officially announced that Massoud had died of injuries in the suicide attack.

It appeared to have been the major terrorist attack which Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.\n\nAnalysts believe [[Osama bin Laden]] ordered Massoud's assassination to help his Taliban protectors and ensure he would have their co-operation in Afghanistan.

Likewise, the killing on September 9, 2001 by Ahmad Shah Massoud, former Minister of Defense of Afghanistan and head of the [[Northern Alliance]] fighting the Taliban, had announced the air attack on [[the Pentagon]], as well as eliminating the greatest Afghan military genius to which the Western reaction would certainly have been linked to the 9/11 attacks.

For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.<ref>{{citeplato|Timaeus|24e\u201325a}}, [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.

In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic method]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.\n\nThe ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical, that would make the perfect example, and he then follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the \"perfect society\" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the \"perfect\" traits described in the ''Republic''.\n\n===''Critias''===\n{{main|Critias (dialogue)}}\n\nAccording to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis\u2014Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com}}</ref><ref>Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report, accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for \"bigger than\" (\"meson\") and \"between\" (\"mezon\") \u2013 {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis \u2013 New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}</ref> but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. Plato asserted that the Egyptians described Atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south \"extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi].\" Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&nbsp;... broke it off all round about&nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].\n\nIn Plato's metaphorical tale, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of Hercules.<ref>The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].</ref> The other four pairs of twins\u2014Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes\u2014were also given \"rule over many men, and a large territory.\"\n\nPoseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city. The walls were constructed of red, white, and black rock, quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]], and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.\n\nAccording to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules, as far as Egypt, and the European continent as far as [[Tyrrhenia]], and had subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.\n\n{{quote|But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timaeus |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html |author=[[Plato]] (360 BCE) |translator=[[Benjamin Jowett]] |accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Logographer (history)|logographer]] [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] wrote an earlier work entitled ''Atlantis'', of which only a few fragments survive.

Crantor also says that Plato's contemporaries used to criticize him jokingly for not being the inventor of his Republic but copying the institutions of the Egyptians. Plato took these critics seriously enough to assign to the Egyptians this story about the Athenians and Atlanteans, so as to make them say that the Athenians really once lived according to that system.}}\n\nThe next sentence is often translated \"Crantor adds, that this is testified by the prophets of the Egyptians, who assert that these particulars [which are narrated by Plato] are written on pillars which are still preserved.\" But in the original, the sentence starts not with the name Crantor but with the ambiguous ''He''; whether this referred to Crantor or to Plato is the subject of considerable debate.

The [[Europeans]] believed the [[indigenous people]] to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in ruins and by sharing a common history, they insinuate that another race must have been responsible.\n\nIn the middle and late nineteenth century, several renowned [[Mesoamerica]]n scholars, starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], formally proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to Mayan and [[Aztec]] culture.\n\nThe French scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg traveled extensively through Mesoamerica in the mid-1800s, and was renowned for his translations of [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] texts, most notably the sacred book [[Popol Vuh]], as well as a comprehensive history of the region.

This is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the Atlantic at all. Few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses, while others have been made by [[psychic]] (e.g., [[Edgar Cayce]]) or other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. (The Atlantis researchers Jacques Collina-Girard and Georgeos D\u00edaz-Montexano, for instance, each claim the other's hypothesis is pseudoscience.)<ref>Collina-Girard, Jacques, ''L'Atlantide retrouv\u00e9e: enqu\u00eate scientifique autour d'un mythe'' (Paris: Belin \u2013 pour la science, 2009).</ref> Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical Atlantis.\n\n[[File:Santorini Landsat.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Satellite image of the islands of [[Santorini]].

The mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in Greece, the largest in the [[Peloponnese]], and that gulf opens onto the Mediterranean Sea. If from the beginning of discussions, misinterpretation of Gibraltar as the location rather than being at the Gulf of Laconia, would lend itself to many erroneous concepts regarding the location of Atlantis. Plato may have not been aware of the difference. The Laconian pillars open to the south toward Crete and beyond which is Egypt. The [[Thera eruption]] and the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] affected that area and might have been the devastation to which the sources used by Plato referred. Significant events such as these would have been likely material for tales passed from one generation to another for almost a thousand years.\n\n===In the Atlantic Ocean===\nThe location of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names.

This description was included in Book 8 of his ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between [[Silenus]] and King [[Midas]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2}}, \"Pious-town\") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Fighting-town\").

The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This was the point of view of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]\u2019s vast mythological epic ''L\u2019Atlantida'' (1877).  After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of [[Barcelona]] and then departs westward again to the [[Hesperides]]. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so \u201ccall the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old\u201d.

The poet recalls \u201cthat the Faroes lie there in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,\u201d but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.<ref>Joensen, Leyvoy. \u201cAtlantis, B\u00e1bylon, T\u00f3rshavn: The Djurhuus Brothers and William Heinesen in Faroese Literary History\u201d.

In the seventeenth century there was [[Fran\u00e7ois de Nom\u00e9]]\u2019s \u201cThe Fall of Atlantis\u201d, which shows a tidal wave surging toward a Baroque city frontage.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atlantis_Monsu_Desiderio.jpg Wikimedia]</ref> The style of architecture apart, it is not very different from [[Nicholas Roerich]]\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Atlantis\u201d of 1928.<ref>[http://img.wikinut.com/img/32jflhip_8dkz5sr/jpeg/0/Gibel-Atlantidy-by-Nicholas-Roerich.jpeg Wikinut]</ref>\n\nThe most dramatic depiction of the catastrophe was [[Leon Bakst]]\u2019s \u201cAncient Terror\u201d (''Terror Antiquus'', 1908), although it does not name Atlantis directly. It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.<ref>Pamela Davidson, \u201cCultural Memory and Survival\u201d, London 2009, [discovery.ucl.ac.uk/69111/1/Cultural Memory FINAL REVISED VERSION.pdf pp.5-15]</ref>\n\nSculptures referencing Atlantis have often been stylized single figures.

Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century.]]\nAn '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2-''autos'' self +  \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2-''bios'' life + \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd-''graphein'' to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word \"autobiography\" was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] ''The [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as \"pedantic\". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''</ref> Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that \"[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time\".<ref name=Pascal>{{cite book|last = Pascal| first = Roy|title = Design and Truth in Autobiography|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1960 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] | pages = | url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }}</ref> Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The [[memoir]] form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.<ref name=Pascal/> \n\n''See also: [[List of autobiographies]] and [[:Category:Autobiographies]] for examples.''\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Life ===\n\nAutobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability\u2014or unwillingness\u2014of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.\n\n=== Spiritual autobiography ===\nSpiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as [[Zahid Rohari]]'s ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography]]'' and ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.\n\n=== Memoirs ===\n{{Main article|Memoir}}\n\nA memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the \"life and times\" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. \n\n[[Leonor L\u00f3pez de C\u00f3rdoba]] (1362\u20131420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614\u20131679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]].\n\n=== Fictional autobiography ===\nThe term \"fictional autobiography\" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.\n\n== Autobiography through the ages ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n\n=== The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession ===\n\nIn antiquity such works were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.\n\nThe Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] introduces his autobiography (''Josephi Vita'', c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.<ref>Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Life of Josephus : translation and commentary, Volume 9</ref>\n\nThe [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314\u2013394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354\u2013430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.  Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. It tells of the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage [[Manichaeism]] in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to [[Christianity]] due to his embracement of [[philosophical scepticism|Skepticism]] and the [[New Academy]] movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology<ref>Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317</ref>). ''Confessions'' will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Henry|title=Confessions|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537822|pages=4 (ix)}}</ref>\n\nIn the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 12th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.\n\n=== Early autobiographies ===\n\n[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]'']]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Leonor L\u00f3pez de C\u00f3rdoba]], a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her ''Memorias'', which may be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].\n\n[[Babur|Z\u0101hir ud-D\u012bn Mohammad B\u0101bur]], who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|B\u0101burn\u0101ma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u06c1}}; literally: ''\"Book of Babur\"'' or ''\"Letters of Babur\"'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.\n\nOne of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500\u20131571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: \"No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty.\"<ref>Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&nbsp;15.</ref> These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.\n\nAnother autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).\n\nIt is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|Book of Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things [[Margery Kempe|Kempe's]] pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]] although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.\n\nPossibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 <ref>The True Travels, Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith into Europe, Aisa, Africa and America from Anno Domini 1593 to 1629</ref> which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's \"tall tales\", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. <ref>Barbour, Philip L (1964) The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. </ref> \n\nOther notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'', 1666).\n\n[[Jarena Lee]] (1783 \u2013 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Doers_of_the_Word.html?id=jrirQL5L0xgC|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)|last=Peterson|first=Carla L.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525143|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\n[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]\nFollowing the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. [[Stendhal]]'s autobiographical writings of the 1830s, ''[[The Life of Henry Brulard]]'' and ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]'', are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.<ref>{{cite book|url=|title=Stendhal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801491245|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}<!--|access-date=July 21, 2015 --></ref> An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.\n\nWith the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation\u2014rather than the exception\u2014that those in the public eye should write about themselves\u2014not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing\u2014far removed from the principles of \"Cellinian\" autobiography.\n<!-- work in progress\u2014to be developed -->\n\n=== 20th and 21st centuries ===\nFrom the 17th century onwards, \"scandalous memoirs\" by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s. So-called \"autobiographies\" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities\u2014and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Naomi Campbell]], admit to not having read their \"autobiographies\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.\n\nAutobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. ''[[A Fortunate Life]]'' by [[Albert Facey]] (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.<ref>about-australia.com.au, 2010</ref> With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela\u2019s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.\n\nA genre where the \"claim for truth\" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is [[autofiction]].\n\nFurthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of \u201cautobiography in verse\u201d equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.<ref>Menotti Lerro, Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain (1950-1980): Narrating Oneself in Verse (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017), p. 33.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [[Autobiographical comics]]\n* [[Autobiographical novel]]\n* [[Autofiction]]\n* [[I Novel]]\n* [[List of autobiographical songs|Autobiographical songs]]\n* [[Biography]]\n* [[List of autobiographies]]\n* [[Memoir]]\n* [[Unreliable narrator]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Barros\n  | first = Carolyn\n  | title = Autobiography: Narrative of Transformation\n  | publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]]\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Buckley\n  | first = Jerome Hamilton\n  | title = The Turning Key: Autobiography and the Subjective Impulse Since 1800\n  | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]\n  | year = 1994\n  | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Lejeune\n  | first = Philippe\n  | title = On Autobiography\n  | publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]]\n  | year = 1989\n  | location = [[Minneapolis]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Olney\n  | first = James\n  | title = Memory & Narrative: The Weave of Life-Writing\n  | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|The University of Chicago Press]]\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = [[Chicago]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Pascal\n  | first = Roy\n  | title = Design and Truth in Autobiography\n  | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]\n  | year = 1960\n  | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | editor-last = Reynolds\n  | editor-first = Dwight F.\n  | title = Interpreting the Self: Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition\n  | publisher = [[University of California Press]]\n  | year = 2001\n  | location = [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Wu\n  | first = Pey-Yi\n  | title = The Confucian's Progress: Autobiographical Writings in Traditional China\n  | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]\n  | year = 1990\n  | location = [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ferrieux\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = L'Autobiographie en Grande-Bretagne et en Irlande\n  | publisher = Ellipses\n  | year = 2001\n  | location = [[Paris]]\n  | pages = 384\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 9782729800215}}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Lerro\n  | first = Menotti\n  | title = Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain, 1950-1980: Narrating Oneself in verse\n  | publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]\n  | pages = 238\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 9781443832748}}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Lerro\n  | first = Menotti\n  | title = The Body in Autobiography and Autobiographical Novels: The Importance of Being Normal\n  | publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing\n  | year = 2018\n  | location = [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]\n  | pages = 120\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 9781527505667}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{Portal bar|Biography}}\n\n[[Category:Autobiographies| ]]\n[[Category:Biography (genre)]]\n[[Category:Articles needing additional references from December 2012]]\n[[Category:Works about history]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 1790s]]", "sha1": "3gx30rbr1764m48bi9ptvg7wc8ylf69"}}, {"title": "Arcadius", "ns": "0", "id": "2180", "revision": {"id": "863637617", "parentid": "863637515", "timestamp": "2018-10-12T01:29:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "RHcosm", "id": "34625434"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/71.195.186.186|71.195.186.186]] ([[User talk:71.195.186.186|talk]]) to last revision by HavelockWilltravel.

He was the eldest son of [[Theodosius I]] and his first wife [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of the Western Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. A weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, [[Aelia Eudoxia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==History==\nArcadius was born in [[Hispania]], the elder son of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], who would become the first [[Western Roman Emperor]]. His father declared him an [[Augustus_(honorific)|Augustus]] and co-ruler for the eastern half of the Empire in January 383. His younger brother was also declared Augustus in 393, for the Western half.\n\nAs emperors, however, both Theodosius' sons are famous for their extraordinarily weak wills and pliancy to ambitious ministers.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', (The Modern Library, 1932), ch. XXIX., p. 1038, 1046</ref> At the death of their father, Honorius was under the control of the Romanized Vandal ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho|Flavius Stilicho]] while Arcadius was dominated by the [[Praetorian Prefect]] of the East, [[Rufinus (consul)|Rufinus]]. Stilicho, who is alleged by some to have aspired to control both Emperors, set off to the east shortly after beginning his reign, leading back the Gothic mercenaries whom Theodosius had taken west in the civil war with [[Arbogastes]] and [[Eugenius]];<ref>Gibbon, pp. 1033-36</ref> Rufinus, who had meanwhile stained his own rule with marked brutality and corruption,<ref>Gibbon, pp. 1028-32</ref> ordered Stilicho to retreat on threat of war, revealing his suspicions. Stilicho complied and sent his army on under the command of its general, [[Gainas]], secretly his ally. When Rufinus greeted Gainas with his army before [[Constantinople]], he was suddenly assassinated on the parade ground by the Goths.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1037</ref> Arcadius had been on the verge of marrying Rufinus' daughter, when the palace eunuchs under the influence of Eutropius, apprehensive of this increase of the Prefect's power, conspired to switch the bride with the daughter of [[Buto]], a Frankish general, called Aelia Eudoxia.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1032</ref> Aside from the indignity to Rufinus, who was not informed of the change in Arcadius' plans, and who was caught off guard in the middle of the marriage ceremony, when the nuptial procession went to Eudoxia's residence rather than his own, this change hinted at his fall from another aspect, since Eudoxia had been raised, after her father's death, in the home of a general allegedly murdered by Rufinus.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1029, 1032</ref>\nSubsequently, the eunuch [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius]] and Arcadius' wife, [[Aelia Eudoxia]], would assume Rufinus' place as advisors, or guardians, of the emperor.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1039</ref>\n \nEutropius' influence lasted four years, but ultimately, he became as unpopular as Rufinus.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XXXII., p. 1151</ref> [[Claudian]], the court poet of Honorius, alleges that the eunuch openly sold the governorships of the provinces, and the civil magistracies, to the highest bidders; at the same time, many of the upper classes were executed on trumped up charges, and their estates confiscated to swell the coffers of the minister and his accomplices.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1153, 1154</ref> New treason laws were enacted under his auspices, by which the ''thought'' was not separated from the ''execution'' of the crime, and by which the sons of the guilty were excluded from the rights of citizenship.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1156, 1157</ref> The last straw came in 399 when Eutropius, a eunuch and former slave, had himself nominated to the consulship, an unprecedented act.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1153</ref> In the same year the [[Ostrogoths]] who had been settled in [[Asia Minor]] by Theodosius I revolted, and Gainas, Eutropius' personal enemy, who was appointed to suppress the insurrection after Eutropius' appointees failed, ultimately persuaded the emperor to give in to their demands, which included, ''inter alia'', the dismissal of Eutropius.<ref>Gibbon, pp. 1157-59</ref> Eudoxia, sensing Eutropius' perilous situation, quickly deserted her former ally, and convinced her husband to give in to the Ostrogoths' demands. Subsequently, Eudoxia alone would have influence over the emperor. That same year, on 13 July, Arcadius issued an edict ordering that [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|all remaining non-Christian temples should be immediately demolished]].\n\nAfter Eutropius' fall, Gainas joined the rebel Ostrogoths, and forced Arcadius to make him [[Magister Militum]], or chief general of the Roman armies, and therefore the most powerful minister in the state.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1161</ref> Additionally, he demanded place for settlement for his troops in Thrace. Arcadius consented, but the Ostrogoths' [[Arianism]] and hostile attitude brought them into conflict with the populace of Constantinople, and Gainas' garrison in the capital was overpowered and massacred in a general riot. Gainas reacted by declaring open war on Arcadius, and advanced on Constantinople before realising it was too strong for him to take. After this the Goths attempted to recross the Hellespont and invade Asia, but were defeated by [[Fravitta]], a loyal Goth in the Roman service who replaced Gainas. The latter fled to the [[Danube]] with his remaining followers, intending to establish an independent kingdom in [[Scythia]], but was ultimately defeated and killed by [[Uldin]] the [[Hun]].<ref>Gibbon, p. 1162, 1163</ref>\n\nEudoxia's influence was strongly opposed by [[John Chrysostom]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], who felt that she had used her family's wealth to gain control over the Emperor. Eudoxia used her influence to have Chrysostom deposed in 404, but she died later that year. Eudoxia gave to Arcadius four children: three daughters, [[Pulcheria]], [[Arcadia (daughter of Arcadius)|Arcadia]] and Marina, and one son, Theodosius, the future Emperor [[Theodosius II]].\n\nArcadius was dominated for the rest of his rule by [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]], the [[Praetorian prefect|Praetorian Prefect]], who made peace with Stilicho in the West.  Arcadius himself was more concerned with appearing to be a pious [[Christianity|Christian]] than he was with political or military matters, and he died, only nominally in control of his Empire, in 408.\n[[File:Arcadius gold multiple CdM Paris Beistegui 239.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] of Arcadius.]]\n\n==Character and works==\nIn this reign of a weak Emperor dominated by court politics, a major theme was the ambivalence felt by prominent individuals and the court parties that formed and regrouped round them towards [[barbarian]]s, which in Constantinople at this period meant [[Goths]]. In the well-documented episode that revolved around [[Gainas]], a number of Gothic ''foederati'' stationed in the capital were massacred, the survivors fleeing under the command of Gainas to [[Thrace]], where they were tracked down by imperial troops and slaughtered and Gainas dispatched.  The episode has been traditionally interpreted as a paroxysm of anti-barbarian reaction that served to stabilize the East. The main source for the affair is a mythology ''\u00e0 clef'' by [[Synesius]] of Cyrene, ''Aegyptus sive de providentia'' (400),<ref>The date 400 is argued for by Cameron and Long 1993.</ref> an Egyptianising allegory that embodies a covert account of the events, the exact interpretation of which continues to baffle scholars. Synesius' ''De regno'', which claims to be addressed to Arcadius himself, contains a tirade against Alaric and the Goths, who had been ravaging Greece before being pacified by Arcadius' offer of peace and independent settlement in Illyricum, in 398.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XXX., p. 1052</ref>\n\nA new [[forum of Arcadius|forum]] was built in the name of Arcadius, on the seventh hill of Constantinople, the ''X\u0113rolophos'', in which a [[column of Arcadius|column]] was begun to commemorate his 'victory' over Gainas (although the column was only completed after Arcadius' death by [[Theodosius II]]).\n\nThe [[Pentelic marble]] portrait head of Arcadius (now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]) was discovered in Istanbul close to the Forum Tauri, in June 1949, in excavating foundations for new buildings of the University at [[Beyaz\u0131t Square|Beyazit]].<ref>Nezih Firatli, \"A Late Antique Imperial Portrait Recently Discovered at Istanbul\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''55'''.1 (January 1951), pp. 67\u201371.</ref> The neck was designed to be inserted in a torso, but no statue, base or inscription was found.

Greenspahn |editor=Lindsay Jones |title=Encyclopedia of Religion |article=Ishmael |volume=7 |year=2005 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |location= |pages=4551\u20134552 |quote=ISHMAEL, or, in Hebrew, Yishma\u02bfe\u02bel; eldest son of Abraham. Ishmael's mother was Hagar, an Egyptian slave girl whom Sarah gave to Abraham because of her own infertility; in accordance with Mesopotamian law, the offspring of such a union would be credited to Sarah (Gn. 16:2). The name Yishma\u02bfe\u02bel is known from various ancient Semitic cultures and means \"God has hearkened,\" suggesting that a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise. Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen by Abraham and expelled with his mother at the instigation of Sarah, who wanted to ensure that Isaac would be Abraham's heir (Gn. 21). In the New Testament, Paul uses this incident to symbolize the relationship between Judaism, the older but now rejected tradition, and Christianity (Gal. 4:21\u201331). In the Genesis account, God blessed Ishmael, promising that he would be the founder of a great nation and a \"wild ass of a man\" always at odds with others (Gn. 16:12). He is credited with twelve sons, described as \"princes according to their tribes\" (Gn. 25:16), representing perhaps an ancient confederacy. The Ishmaelites, vagrant traders closely related to the [[Midian]]ites, were apparently regarded as his descendants. The fact that Ishmael's wife and mother are both said to have been Egyptian suggests close ties between the Ishmaelites and Egypt. According to Genesis 25:17, Ishmael lived to the age of 137. Islamic tradition tends to ascribe a larger role to Ishmael than does the Bible. He is considered a prophet and, according to certain theologians, the offspring whom Abraham was commanded to sacrifice (although surah Judaism has generally regarded him as wicked, although repentance is also ascribed to him. According to some rabbinic traditions, his two wives were Aisha and Fatima, whose names are the same as those of Muhammad's wife and daughter Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples. Bibliography A survey of the Bible's patriarchal narratives can be found in Nahum M. Sarna's Understanding Genesis (New York, 1966). Postbiblical traditions, with reference to Christian and Islamic views, are collected in Louis Ginzberg's exhaustive Legends of the Jews, 2d ed., 2 vols., translated by Henrietta Szold and Paul Radin (Philadelphia, 2003).

They spoke a variety of different languages and were for the most part Christians, with some Jewish minorities. Their Arabization and Islamization took place with the vast expansion of Islam in the decades and centuries following the death of the Prophet in 632 CE. The Aramaic language, once dominant in the Fertile Crescent, survives in only a few remote villages and in the rituals of the Eastern churches. Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy.

[[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called ''Gharab'' (\"West\") by [[Mesopotamia]]ns because Bedouins originally resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into \"Arab\".\n\nYet another view is held by [[al-Masudi]] that the word \"Arabs\" was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the \"[[Arabah]]\" valley. In Biblical etymology, \"Arab\" (in Hebrew ''Arvi'' ) comes both from the desert origin of the Bedouins it originally described (''Arava'' means wilderness).\n\nThe root ''\u02bf-r-b'' has several additional meanings in Semitic languages\u2014including \"west/sunset,\" \"desert,\" \"mingle,\" \"mixed,\" \"merchant,\" and \"raven\"\u2014and are \"comprehensible\" with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name.

The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to&nbsp;[[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam. Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was [[Dilmun]], which arose around the 4th millennium BCE and lasted to 538 BCE, and [[Thamud]], which arose around the 1st millennium BCE and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, [[Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaean kingdom]] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u064e\u0640\u0628\u064e\u0640\u0623|Saba'}},<ref name=\"Cite quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns\">{{cite quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns}}</ref> possibly [[Sheba]]),<ref name=\"Sheba-01\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsMiddEast/ArabicSaba.htm |title=Saba / Sa'abia / Sheba |accessdate=2008-06-27 |publisher=The History Files (http://www.historyfiles.co.uk) |quote=The kingdom of Saba is known to have existed in the region of Yemen. By 1000 BC caravan trains of camels journeyed from Oman in south-east Arabia to the Mediterranean. As the [[camel driver]]s passed through the [[desert]]s of Yemen, experts believe that many of them would have called in at Ma'rib. Dating from at least 1050 BC, and now barren and dry, [[Ma'rib]] was then a lush [[oasis]] teeming with [[palm tree]]s and [[introduced species|exotic]] [[plant]]s. Ideally placed, it was situated on the trade routes and with a unique [[dam]] of vast proportions. It was also one of only two main sources of [[frankincense]] (the other being [[East Africa]]), so Saba had a virtual [[monopoly]]. Ma'rib's [[wealth]] accumulated to such an extent that the city became a byword for riches beyond belief throughout the Arab world. Its people, the [[Sabeans]] - a group whose name bears the same etymological root as Saba - lived in [[South Arabia]] between the tenth and sixth centuries BC. Their main temple - [[Mahram Bilqis]], or [[temple]] of the moon god (situated about three miles (5 km) from the capital city of Ma'rib) - was so famous that it remained [[sacred]] even after the collapse of the Sabean civilisation in the sixth century BC - caused by the rerouting of the [[spice]] trail. By that point the dam, now in a poor state of repair, was finally breached. The [[irrigation]] system was lost, the people abandoned the site within a year or so, and the temple fell into disrepair and was eventually covered by sand. Saba was known by the [[Hebrews]] as Sheba ''[Note that the collapse of the dam was actually in 575 [[Common Era|CE]], as shown in the timeline in the same article in the History Files, and attested by MacCulloch (2009)].''}}</ref> and the coastal areas of [[Eastern Arabia]] were controlled by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanians]] from 300 BCE.\n\n====Origins and early history====\n{{further|Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Proto-Arabic}}\nAccording to Arab-[[Islamic\u2013Jewish relations|Islamic-Jewish traditions]], [[Ishmael]] was father of the Arabs, to be the ancestor of the [[Ishmaelites]].<ref>\n* Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples. {{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of religion|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=9780028657400|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0jMOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Ishmael|language=en}}\n* Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several prominent [[Arab]] [[Tribes of Arabia|tribes]] and being the forefather of Muhammad.

The term \"A'raab\" mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word {{transl|ar|\u02bfarab}}, only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective {{transl|ar|\u02bfarabiy}}. The Qur'an calls itself {{transl|ar|\u02bfarabiy}}, \"Arabic\", and {{transl|ar|Mubin}}, \"clear\". The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2\u20133, \"By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand\". The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the {{transl|ar|al-\u02bfarabiyya}}, the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[\u02bei\u02bfr\u0101b]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun {{transl|ar|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}} refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ''[[at-Tawba]]'' 97,\n\n{{transl|ar|al-\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101bu \u02bea\u0161addu kufr\u0101n wanif\u0101q\u0101n}} \"the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy\".\n\nBased on this, in early Islamic terminology, {{transl|ar|\u02bfarabiy}} referred to the language, and {{transl|ar|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}} to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the eighth century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-\u02bfArab}}, \"language of the Arabs\", denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.\n\n====Classical kingdoms====\n{{main|Palmyra|Nabateans}}\n[[File:Petra, Al-Khazneh 2.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]].]]\nProto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence.

Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''.

Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 1986. p. 1 653</ref> Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages.\n\nAbout nine [[extant taxon|extant]] [[genus|genera]] and 21 extant [[species]] of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour. Their average length is about {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}}, including tail. The [[giant armadillo]] grows up to {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while the [[pink fairy armadillo]] is a diminutive species, with an overall length of {{convert|13|\u2013|15|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. All species are native to the [[Americas]], where they inhabit a variety of different environments.\n\nRecent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals, the [[glyptodont]]s, should be included within the lineage of armadillos, having diverged some 35 million years ago, much more recently than previously assumed.<ref name =AMNH2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/research-posts/study-finds-relationship-between-glyptodonts-modern-armadillos|title=Study finds relationship between glyptodonts, armadillos|publisher=AMNH|accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref>\n\n==History and distribution==\nLike all of the Xenarthra lineages, armadillos originated in South America. Due to the continent's former isolation, they were confined there for most of the [[Cenozoic]]. The recent formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern North America by the early [[Pleistocene]], as part of the [[Great American Interchange]].<ref name=\"Woodburne2010\"/> (Some of their much larger [[Cingulata|cingulate]] relatives, the [[pampathere]]s and chlamyphorid [[glyptodont]]s, made the same journey.)<ref name=\"Woodburne2010\"/>\n\nToday, all extant armadillo species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in [[Paraguay]] (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of ''[[Dasypus]]'', are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as [[Yepes's mulita]], are restricted to small ranges. Two species, the [[northern naked-tailed armadillo]] and [[nine-banded armadillo]], are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as [[South Carolina]] and [[Florida]], and as far north as southern [[Nebraska]] and southern [[Indiana]].<ref name=ExpRange/> Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural predators.\n\n==Habitat and anatomy==\nArmadillos are small to medium-sized mammals. The smallest species, the pink fairy armadillo, is roughly [[chipmunk]]-sized at {{convert|85|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|13|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length. The largest species, the giant armadillo, can be the size of a small [[pig]] and weigh up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and can be {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=NatGeo/> They are prolific diggers. Many species use their sharp claws to dig for food, such as [[Larva|grubs]], and to dig dens. The nine-banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks, streams, and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] around which it lives and feeds. The diets of different armadillo species vary, but consist mainly of [[insect]]s, grubs, and other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species, however, feed almost entirely on ants and termites.\n[[File:Mani armadilli.png|thumb|left|Paws of a hairy and a giant armadillo]]\nIn common with other xenarthrans, armadillos, in general, have low [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]s of {{convert|33|-|36|C}} and low [[basal metabolic rate]]s (40\u201360% of that expected in placental mammals of their mass). This is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source (for example, ''[[Priodontes]]'' and ''[[Tolypeutes]]'').<ref name=\"McNab\"/>\n\nThe armour is formed by [[plate (anatomy)|plates]] of [[dermal bone]] covered in relatively small, overlapping epidermal scales called \"[[scute]]s\", composed of bone with a covering of horn. Most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks. Additional armour covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs, and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armoured, and is simply covered with soft skin and fur.<ref name=\"EoM\"/>\n\nThis armour-like skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into thorny patches, from which their armour protects them) or digging to safety. Only the South American three-banded armadillos (''Tolypeutes'') rely heavily on their armour for protection. When threatened by a [[predator]], ''Tolypeutes'' species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates. The North American nine-banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles.<ref name=LOC/>\n\nArmadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly.  The nine-banded armadillo is noted for its movement through water<ref name=McDonough2013/> which is accomplished via two different methods: it can walk underwater for short distances, holding its breath for as long as six minutes; also, to cross larger bodies of water, it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air, inflating its stomach and intestines.<ref name=Vijayaraghavan/>\n\nArmadillos have very poor eyesight, and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food.<ref name=NatGeo/> They use their claws for digging and finding food, as well as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws, making only a single corridor the width of the animal's body. They have five clawed toes on their hind feet, and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet. Armadillos have a large number of cheek teeth which are not divided into [[premolar]]s and [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, but usually have no [[incisor]]s or [[canine (tooth)|canine]]s. The [[dentition]] of the nine-banded armadillo is P 7/7, M 1/1 = 32.<ref name=\"Freeman&Genoways\"/>\n\n[[Gestation]] lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits [[delayed implantation]], so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus ''Dasypus'' give birth to four [[monozygotic]] young (that is, identical quadruplets),<ref name=Bagatto2000/> but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born with soft, leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks. They reach sexual maturity in three to 12 months, depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.<ref name=\"EoM\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Pink Fairy Armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Pink fairy armadillo]]]]\n'''Family [[Dasypus|Dasypodidae]]'''\n* Subfamily [[Dasypus|Dasypodinae]]\n** Genus ''[[Dasypus]]'' [[File:TatusorGuineanBeast.jpg|thumb|right|1658 woodcut of an armadillo]]\n***[[Nine-banded armadillo]] or long-nosed armadillo, ''Dasypus novemcinctus''\n***[[Seven-banded armadillo]], ''Dasypus septemcinctus''\n***[[Southern long-nosed armadillo]], ''Dasypus hybridus''\n***[[Llanos long-nosed armadillo]], ''Dasypus sabanicola''\n***[[Greater long-nosed armadillo]], ''Dasypus kappleri''\n***[[Hairy long-nosed armadillo]], ''Dasypus pilosus''\n***[[Yepes's mulita]], ''Dasypus yepesi''\n***\u2020Beautiful armadillo, ''[[Dasypus bellus]]''\n** Genus \u2020''[[Stegotherium]]''\n\n'''Family [[Chlamyphoridae]]'''\n* Subfamily [[Chlamyphorinae]]\n** Genus ''[[Calyptophractus]]''\n*** [[Greater fairy armadillo]], ''Calyptophractus retusus''\n** Genus ''[[Chlamyphorus]]''\n***[[Pink fairy armadillo]], ''Chlamyphorus truncatus''\n* Subfamily [[Euphractinae]]\n** Genus ''[[Chaetophractus]]'' [[File:Chaetophractus vellerosus3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Screaming hairy armadillo]]]]\n***[[Screaming hairy armadillo]], ''Chaetophractus vellerosus''\n***[[Big hairy armadillo]], ''Chaetophractus villosus''\n***[[Andean hairy armadillo]], ''Chaetophractus nationi''\n**Genus \u2020''[[Macroeuphractus]]''\n**Genus \u2020''[[Paleuphractus]]''\n**Genus \u2020''[[Proeuphractus]]''\n**Genus \u2020''[[Doellotatus]]''\n**Genus \u2020''[[Peltephilus]]''\n*** \u2020Horned armadillo, ''Peltephilus ferox''\n** Genus ''[[Euphractus]]''\n***[[Six-banded armadillo]], ''Euphractus sexcinctus''\n** Genus ''[[Zaedyus]]''\n***[[Pichi]], ''Zaedyus pichiy''\n* Subfamily [[Tolypeutinae]]\n** Genus \u2020''[[Kuntinaru]]''<ref name=Billetetal/>\n** Genus ''[[Cabassous]]'' [[File:SouthernThreeBandedArmadillo065b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Southern three-banded armadillo]]]]\n***[[Northern naked-tailed armadillo]], ''Cabassous centralis''\n***[[Chacoan naked-tailed armadillo]], ''Cabassous chacoensis''\n***[[Southern naked-tailed armadillo]], ''Cabassous unicinctus''\n***[[Greater naked-tailed armadillo]], ''Cabassous tatouay''\n** Genus ''[[Priodontes]]''\n***[[Giant armadillo]], ''Priodontes maximus''\n** Genus ''[[Tolypeutes]]''\n***[[Southern three-banded armadillo]], ''Tolypeutes matacus''\n***[[Brazilian three-banded armadillo]], ''Tolypeutes tricinctus''\n\n\u2020 indicates extinct taxon\n\n==Armadillos and humans==\n\n===In science===\nArmadillos are often used in the study of [[leprosy]], since they, along with mangabey monkeys, rabbits, and mice (on their footpads), are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically.

Jews were generally seen as a religious group (not a separate race), thus being a part of the \"Arab family\".<ref>Lewis (1999), p. 131</ref>\n\nDhimmis were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in [[Racial segregation|segregated]] quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a Jew did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). Dhimmis had to pay a special poll tax (the ''[[jizya]]''), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the ''[[zakat]]'' alms tax required of Muslims. In return, dhimmis were granted limited rights, including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of [[list of events named massacres|massacres]] and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Jews in North Africa,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080927133652/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=66&Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees]</ref> especially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]] where eventually Jews were forced to live in [[mellah|ghettos]].<ref>Roumani, Maurice.

E. Von Grunebaum:\n\n<blockquote>It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians.

On February 5, 1840, [[Franciscan]] [[Capuchin friar]] Father Thomas and his Greek servant were reported missing, never to be seen again. The [[Turkey|Turkish]] governor and the French consul [[Ratti-Menton]] believed accusations of ritual murder and blood libel, as the alleged murder occurred before the Jewish [[Passover]]. An investigation was staged, and Solomon Negrin, a Jewish barber, [[Forced confession|confessed under torture]] and accused other Jews. Two other Jews died under torture, and one (Moses Abulafia) converted to [[Islam]] to escape torture. More arrests and atrocities followed, culminating in 63 Jewish children being held [[hostage]] and mob attacks on Jewish communities throughout the Middle East. International outrage led to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in Egypt ordering an investigation. Negotiations in [[Alexandria]] eventually secured the unconditional release and recognition of innocence of the nine prisoners still remaining alive (out of thirteen). Later in [[Constantinople]], [[Moses Montefiore]] (leader of the British Jewish community) persuaded Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]] to issue a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (edict) intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the [[Ottoman Empire]]:\n<blockquote>\n... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth....\n</blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, pogroms spread through the Middle East and North Africa: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jaffa (1876), Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901\u201302), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901\u201307), Port Said (1903, 1908), and Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891).<ref>Yossef Bodansky.

British troops stationed in Palestine arrived fresh from deployment in the [[Russian civil war]], fighting alongside the [[White Movement]]. The British forces are credited with introducing the [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic hoax]] called ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' to Palestine. In March 1921, Musa Khazem El Husseini, Mayor of Jerusalem, told [[Winston Churchill]] \"The Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands. ...

The Nazi regime also provided funding to the Egyptian [[Moslem Brotherhood]], which began calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses in 1936.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\nBernard Lewis also describes Nazi influence in the Arab world, including its impact on [[Michel Aflaq]], the principal founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]] (which later dominated Syria and Iraq).<blockquote> After the promulgation of the Nuremberg Laws, Hitler received telegrams of congratulation from all over the Arab and Muslim world, especially from Morocco and Palestine, where the Nazi propaganda had been most active....

These structures have been largely hypothetical insofar as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been built.\n\nThe concept has been popularized by various [[science fiction]] writers. Authors such as [[Peter F. Hamilton|Peter Hamilton]] in ''[[The Neutronium Alchemist|Neutronium Alchemist]]'' and [[Paolo Bacigalupi]] in ''[[The Water Knife]]'' explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios. They are often portrayed as self-contained or [[Autarky|economically self-sufficient]].\n\n==Development==\nAn arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the [[Human impact on the environment|impact of human habitation]] on any given [[ecosystem]]. It could be self-sustainable, employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life: power; climate control; food production; air and water conservation and purification; sewage treatment; etc. An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population. An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.\n\nArcology was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version<ref>Wright, Frank Lloyd, \"An Organic Architecture\"</ref> called [[Broadacre City]] although, in contrast to an arcology, Wright's idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright's plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright's solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the U.S.A. actually has.\n\n[[Buckminster Fuller]] proposed the [[Old Man River's City project]], a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]].\n\nPaolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term 'arcology'.<ref>Soleri, Paolo, \"Arcology: The City in the Image of Man\"</ref> Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in [[resource consumption]] and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He advocated for greater \"frugality\" and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit (and public libraries).\n\n==Similar real-world projects==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}\n[[Arcosanti]] is an experimental \"arcology prototype\" \u2013 a demonstration project under construction in central [[Arizona]]. Designed by [[Paolo Soleri]], its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri's personal designs, his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form.\n\nMany cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like [[Tokyo]], and  [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] near [[Shanghai]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635188,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British to help China build 'eco-cities' | first=Frank | last=Kane | date=November 6, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/23/greenwash-dongtan-ecocity|title=Greenwash: The dream of the first eco-city was built on a fiction|author=Fred Pearce|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nCertain urban projects reflect arcology principles. Pedestrian connection systems often provide a wide range of goods and services in a single structure. Some examples include the [[+15]] system in downtown [[Calgary]], Montr\u00e9al's [[R\u00c9SO]], the [[Minneapolis Skyway System]], The Windscreen in [[Fermont|Fermont, Quebec]], and the [[Houston tunnel system|Houston, Texas tunnel system]]. They include supermarkets, malls and entertainment complexes. The +15 is the world's most extensive skywalk, at {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total length. Minneapolis has the longest single path, at {{convert|8|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}}. [[Seward's Success, Alaska]] was never built, but would have been a small city just outside [[Anchorage]]. [[Chicago]] has a sizeable tunnel system known as the [[Chicago Pedway]] connecting a portion of the buildings in the [[Chicago Loop]].\n\nThe [[Las Vegas Strip]] has many arcology features to protect people from the {{convert|45|C}} heat. Many major casinos are connected by tunnels, footbridges, and monorails. It is possible to travel from [[Mandalay Bay]] at the south end of the Strip to the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]], {{convert|3|mi|km|0|spell=in}} to the north, without using streets. In many cases, it is possible to travel between several different casinos without ever going outdoors. It is possible to live in this complex without need to venture outside, except the Strip has not generally been considered self-sustainable. Soleri did not advocate for enclosed cities, although he did sketch a design and build a model of an 'arcology' for outer space.\n\nThe [[Toronto]] downtown area features an underground pedestrian network, [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]]. Multiple high-rises are connected by a series of underground tunnels. It is possible to live in this complex without needing to venture outside, but the PATH network is not self-sustaining. The total network spans {{convert|28|km|mi|abbr=off|adj=off}}.\n\n[[McMurdo Station]] of the [[United States Antarctic Program]] and other scientific research stations on [[Antarctica]] resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. The station is not self-sufficient{{snd}}the U.S. military delivers 30,000 cubic metres (8,000,000 US gal) of fuel and {{convert|11|e6lb|order=flip|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} of supplies and equipment yearly through its [[Operation Deep Freeze]] resupply effort<ref>''Modern Marvels: Sub-Zero''. The History Channel.</ref>{{snd}}but it is isolated from conventional support networks. The base generates electricity with its own power plant, and grows fruits and vegetables in a hydroponic green <!--<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctichydroponics.com/|title=Antar|work=antarctichydroponics.com}}</ref>-->  house when resupply is non-existent. Under [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty|international treaty]], it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.\n\n[[Crystal Island]] is a proposed arcology in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].

The pair of buildings contains residential housing as well as a school, grocery, and municipal offices.\nWhittier once boasted a second structure known as the Buckner Building. The Buckner Building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digg.com/video/everyone-in-this-alaskan-town-lives-in-the-same-building|title=Everyone In This Alaskan Town Lives In The Same Building|work=digg.com}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nMost proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural or conceptual shortcomings. Arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works.<ref>Ash, Theodore (2014) ''Neoarcology''</ref>\n\n* One of the earliest examples in literature is [[William Hope Hodgson]]'s 1912 horror/fantasy novel ''[[The Night Land]]'', where the last remnants of humanity survive in two enormous self-contained metal pyramids.\n* Another significant example is the 1981 novel ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]], in which a segment of the population of Los Angeles has moved into an arcology. The plot examines the social changes that result, both inside and outside the arcology. Thus the arcology is not just a plot device but a subject of critique.<ref>Seed, David (2011) ''Science Fiction: A Very Short Introduction''</ref>\n* In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''The World Inside'', most of the global population of 750 billion lives inside giant skyscrapers, called \"urbmons\", each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people. The urbmons are arranged in \"constellations\". Each urbmon is divided into \"neighborhoods\" of 40 or so floors. All the needs of the inhabitants are provided inside the building &ndash; food is grown outside and brought into the building &ndash; so the idea of going outside is heretical and can be a sign of madness.<ref>[[Robert Silverberg|Silverberg, Robert]] (1971).

It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the [[Commodore 64]] and the Sinclair [[ZX Spectrum]], where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe.\n\nThe series spawned a total of six distinct models: The ''CPC464'', ''CPC664'', and ''CPC6128'' were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market. The later ''plus'' models, ''464plus'' and ''6128plus'', efforts to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates, were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage the ''plus'' hardware into a game console as the ''GX4000''.\n\nThe CPC models' hardware is based on the [[Zilog Z80A]] [[CPU]], complemented with either 64 or 128&nbsp;KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device, either a compact cassette deck or 3&nbsp;inch floppy disk drive. The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour, green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit's power supply.<ref name=\"464 Manual\">CPC464 User Manual, p. 11, Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc.</ref> Additionally, a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives, printers, and memory extensions, was available.\n\nThe CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software. The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor, its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run [[CP/M]] software also rendered the system attractive for business users, which was reflected by a wide selection of application software.\n\nDuring its lifetime, the CPC series sold approximately three million units.<ref name=\"Amstrad Product Archive\">{{cite web |title=Amstrad Product Archive |url=http://www.amstrad.com/products/archive/index.html |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Schneider CPC6128 white.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Schneider CPC6128 was a Schneider-branded version of the Amstrad CPC6128, and very similar in appearance.]]<!-- Right-aligned image occupying otherwise unused space beside contents list -->\n\n==Models==\n\n===The original range===\nThe philosophy behind the CPC series was twofold, firstly the concept was of an \u201call-in-one\u201d, where the computer, keyboard and its data storage device were combined in a single unit, and sold with its own dedicated display monitor. Most home computers at that time such as [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]]\u2019s ZX series, the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[BBC Micro]] relied on the use of the domestic [[television]] set and a separately connected [[tape recorder]] or [[disk storage|disk drive]]. In itself, the all-in-one concept was not new, having been seen before on business-oriented machines and the [[Commodore PET]], but in the home computer space, it predated the [[Apple Macintosh]] by almost a year.\n\nSecondly, Amstrad founder [[Alan Sugar]] wanted the machine to resemble a \u201creal computer, similar to what someone would see being used to check them in at the airport for their holidays\u201d,<ref name=\"Newkey-Burden2010\">{{cite book|author=Chas Newkey-Burden|title=Sir Alan Sugar: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vW5MQQAACAAJ|accessdate=7 January 2011|date=2 October 2010|publisher=John Blake|isbn=978-1-84454-891-0}}</ref> and for the machine to not look like \u201ca pregnant calculator\u201d<ref name=\"Sugar2010\">{{cite book|author=Alan Sugar|title=What You See Is What You Get: My Autobiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSLXRgAACAAJ|accessdate=7 January 2011|date=8 October 2010|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-74933-7}}</ref> \u2013 in reference presumably to the [[Sinclair ZX81]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum|ZX Spectrum]] with their low cost, membrane-type keyboards.\n[[File:Cpc464.computer.750pix.jpg|thumb|Children playing ''[[Paperboy (video game)|Paperboy]]'' on the CPC 464 in 1988]]\n\n====[[Amstrad CPC 464|CPC 464]]====\n{{Main article|Amstrad CPC 464}}\nThe [[Amstrad CPC 464|CPC 464]] was one of the most successful computers in Europe and sold more than two million units.<ref>{{cite web|title=OLD-COMPUTERS.COM : The Museum|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=84|website=www.old-computers.com|accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe CPC 464 featured 64&nbsp;KB RAM and an internal [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] deck. It was introduced in June 1984 in the UK. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC464 were GBP\u00a3249.00/DM899.00 with a green screen and GBP\u00a3359.00/DM1398.00 with a colour monitor. Following the introduction of the CPC6128 in late 1985, suggested retail prices for the CPC464 were cut by GBP\u00a350.00/DM100.00.\n\nIn 1990, the 464plus replaced the CPC 464 in the model line-up, and production of the CPC 464 was discontinued.\n\n====CPC664====\n[[File:Schneider 664 en.jpg|thumb|A ''CPC664'' main unit (German Schneider-brand variant)]]\nThe CPC664 features 64&nbsp;KB RAM and an internal 3-inch floppy disk drive. It was introduced in May 1985 in the UK. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC664 were GBP\u00a3339.00/DM1198.00 with a green screen and GBP\u00a3449.00/DM1998.00 with a colour monitor.\n\nAfter the successful release of the CPC464, consumers were constantly asking for two improvements: more memory and an internal disk drive. For Amstrad, the latter was easier to realize. At the deliberately low-key introduction of the CPC664 in May 1985, the machine was positioned not only as the lowest-cost disk system but even the lowest-cost CP/M 2.2 machine. In the Amstrad CPC product range the CPC664 complemented the CPC464 which was neither discontinued nor reduced in price.<ref>The CPC664, ''Amstrad Computer User'' May 1985, P. 42-46.</ref>\n\nCompared to the CPC464, the CPC664's main unit has been significantly redesigned, not only to accommodate the floppy disk drive but also with a redesigned keyboard area. Touted as \"ergonomic\" by Amstrad's promotional material, the keyboard is noticeably tilted to the front with [[MSX]]-style cursor keys above the numeric keypad. Compared to the CPC464's multicoloured keyboard, the CPC664's keys are kept in a much quieter grey and pale blue colour scheme.\n\nThe back of the CPC664 main unit features the same connectors as the CPC464, with the exception of an additional 12V power lead. Unlike the CPC464's cassette tape drive that could be powered off the main unit's 5V voltage, the CPC664's floppy disk drive requires an additional 12V voltage. This voltage had to be separately supplied by an updated version of the bundled green screen/colour monitor (GT-65 and CTM-644 respectively).\n\nThe CPC664 was only produced for approximately six months. In late 1985, when the CPC6128 was introduced in Europe, Amstrad decided not to keep three models in the line-up, and production of the CPC664 was discontinued.<ref name=\"InterviewPerry\">{{cite web|title=Interview with Roland Perry (in French language)|publisher=Amstrad Forever|url=http://amstrad.cpc.free.fr/article.php?sid=38|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720221414/http://amstrad.cpc.free.fr/article.php?sid=38|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====CPC6128====\n[[File:Amstrad CPC6128, keyboard removed.jpg|thumb|CPC6128 motherboard.]]\nThe CPC6128 features 128&nbsp;KB RAM and an internal 3-inch floppy disk drive. Aside from various hardware and firmware improvements, one of the CPC6128's most prominent features is the compatibility with the CP/M+ operating system that rendered it attractive for business uses.\n\nThe CPC6128 was released in August 1985 and initially only sold in the US. Imported and distributed by Indescomp, Inc. of Chicago, it was the first Amstrad product to be sold in the United States, a market that at the time was traditionally hostile towards European computer manufacturers.<ref>''Amstrad Computer User'', \"User News...\", August 1985, p. 7.</ref> By the end of 1985, it arrived in Europe and replaced the CPC664 in the CPC model line-up. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC6128 were US$699.00/\u00a3299.00/DM1598.00 with a green screen and US$799.00/\u00a3399.00/DM2098.00 with a colour monitor.\n\nIn 1990, the 6128plus replaced the CPC6128 in the model line-up, and production of the CPC6128 was discontinued.\n\n===The ''plus range''===\nIn 1990, confronted with a changing home computer market, Amstrad decided to refresh the CPC model range by introducing a new range variantly labeled ''plus'' or ''PLUS'', ''1990'', or ''CPC+ range''. The main goals were numerous enhancements to the existing CPC hardware platform, to restyle the casework to provide a contemporary appearance, and to add native support of cartridge media. The new model palette includes three variants, the ''464plus'' and ''6128plus'' computers and the ''GX4000'' video game console. The \"CPC\" abbreviation was dropped from the model names.\n\nThe redesign significantly enhanced the CPC hardware, mainly to rectify its previous shortcomings as a gaming platform. The redesigned video hardware allows for hardware sprites and soft scrolling, with a colour palette extended from a maximum of 16&nbsp;colours (plus separately definable border) at one time from a choice of 27, increased to a maximum of 32 out of 4096. The enhanced sound hardware offers automatic DMA transfer, allowing more complex sound effects with a significantly reduced processor overhead. Other hardware enhancements include the support of analogue joysticks, 8-bit printers, and ROM cartridges up to 4 [[megabit|Mbit]]s.\n\nThe new range of models was intended to be completely backward compatible with the original CPC models. Its enhanced features are only available after a deliberately obscure unlocking mechanism has been triggered, thus preventing existing CPC software from accidentally invoking them.<ref name=\"ArnoldVSpec\">{{cite web|title=Arnold \"V\" Specification 1.4|last=Lawson|first=Cliff|publisher=Amstrad|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/arnold5.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001118214900/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/arnold5.htm|archivedate=18 November 2000 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\nDespite the significant hardware enhancements, many viewed it as outdated, being based on an 8-bit CPU and it failed to attract both customers and software producers who were moving towards [[16-bit]] systems such as the Commodore Amiga and Sega Megadrive which was launched a few short months after the plus range. The plus range was a commercial failure,<ref>[[Retro Gamer]] issue 83, From the Archives: Radical Software</ref> and production was discontinued shortly after its introduction in 1990.\n\n====464plus, 6128plus====\n[[File:6128plus es.jpg|thumb|A ''6128plus'' main unit (with Spanish keyboard layout)]]\nThe ''464plus'' and ''6128plus'' models were intended as \"more sophisticated and stylish\" replacements of the CPC464 and CPC6128. Based on the redesigned plus hardware platform, they share the same base characteristics as their predecessors: The 464plus is equipped with 64&nbsp;KB RAM and a cassette tape drive, the 6128plus features 128&nbsp;KB RAM and a 3\" floppy disk drive. Both models share a common case layout with a keyboard taken over from the CPC6128 model, and the respective mass storage drive inserted in a case breakout.\n\nIn order to simplify the [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] screening process, the edge connectors of the previous models have been replaced with micro-ribbon connectors as previously used on the German Schneider CPC6128. As a result, a wide range  of extensions for the original CPC range is connector-incompatible with the 464plus and 6128plus. In addition, the 6128plus does not have a tape socket for an external tape drive.\n\nThe plus range is not equipped with an on-board ROM, and thus the 464plus and the 6128plus do not contain a firmware. Instead, Amstrad provided the firmware for both models via the ROM extension facility, contained on the included ''Burnin' Rubber and Locomotive BASIC'' cartridge. This resulted in reduced hardware localization cost (only some select key caps and case labels had to be localized) with the added benefit of a rudimentary copy protection mechanism (without a firmware present, the machine itself could not copy a game cartridge's content).<ref name=\"ArnoldVSpec\"/> As the enhanced ''V4'' firmware's structural differences causes problems with some CPC software directly calling firmware functions by their memory addresses, Amstrad separately sold a cartridge containing the original CPC6128's ''V3'' firmware.<ref name=\"GrimwareCartridges\">{{cite web|title=Amstrad System Cartridges|publisher=grimware.org|url=http://www.grimware.org/doku.php/documentations/hardware/amstrad.cartridge.released|accessdate=22 March 2010}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nBoth the 464plus and the 6128plus were introduced to the public in September 1990. Initial suggested retail prices were FRF1990 with a green screen and FRF2990 with a colour monitor for the 464plus, and FRF2990 with a green screen and FRF3990 with a colour monitor for the 6128plus.\n\n====GX4000====\n[[File:Amstrad-GX4000-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The Amstrad GX4000]]{{main article|Amstrad GX4000}}\nDeveloped as part of the ''plus range'', the GX4000 was Amstrad's short-lived attempt to enter the video game consoles market.  Sharing the plus range's enhanced hardware characteristics, it represents the bare minimum variant of the range without a keyboard or support for mass storage devices.<ref name=\"ArnoldVSpec\"/>  It came bundled with 2 paddle controllers and the racing game Burning Rubber.\n\n===Special models and clones===\n\n====CPC472====\n[[File:472 es.jpg|thumb|CPC472]]\nIn 1985, Spain briefly introduced an import tax on computers without \u00f1 letter key and containing 64KB or less of RAM. To circumvent this, Amstrad's Spanish distributor ''Indescomp'' (later to become ''Amstrad Spain'') created and distributed the ''CPC472'', a modified version of the CPC464. Its main difference is a small additional daughter board containing a CPC664 ROM chip, and an 8&nbsp;KB memory chip which is not electrically connected to the machine, and consequently rendered unusable. Its sole purpose was supposedly to increase the machine's total memory specs to 72&nbsp;KB in order to circumvent the import tax. Only a month after the CPC472 had been released, Amstrad added the \u00f1 key for the 464 so this tariff was not applied to 64k computers anymore and production of the CPC472 was discontinued.<ref name=\"CPCWikiCPC472\">{{cite web|title=CPC472|publisher=CPCWiki|url=http://cpcwiki.eu/index.php/472|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n====KC compact====\n<!-- Section title used in redirects to this page -->\n[[File:KC-compact-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Kleincomputer KC compact]]\nThe ''{{Interlanguage link multi|KC compact|de}}'' (\"{{lang|de|Kleincomputer}}\" - which means \"small computer\" - being a rather literal German translation of the English \"microcomputer\") is a clone of the Amstrad CPC built by [[East Germany]]'s ''{{lang|de|[[Volkseigene Betriebe|VEB]] Mikroelektronik M\u00fchlhausen}}'' in October 1989. Although the machine included various substitutes and emulations of an Amstrad CPC's hardware, the machine is largely compatible with Amstrad CPC software.

As typical Z80 instructions require three or four CPU cycles, the resulting loss of processing power is minor, reducing the effective clock rate to approximately 3.3&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"SOFT968\">CPC464/664/6128\nFirmware ROM routines and explanations (Soft 968)</ref>\n\n===Memory===\nAmstrad CPCs are equipped with either 64 (CPC464, CPC664, 464plus, GX4000) or 128 (CPC6128, 6128plus)&nbsp;KB of RAM.<ref name=\"464 Tech spec\"/><ref name=\"6128 Tech spec\">Technical Specification, CPC6128 Service Manual, p. 31., Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc.</ref> This base memory can be extended by up to 512&nbsp;KB using memory expansions sold by third-party manufacturers, and by up to 4096&nbsp;KB using experimental methods developed by hardware enthusiasts. Because the Z80 processor is only able to directly address 64&nbsp;KB of memory, additional memory from the 128&nbsp;KB models and memory expansions is made available using [[bank switching]].\n\n===Video===\n[[File:Schneider CPC6128 with green monitor GT65, Wikipedia logo.jpg|thumb|upright|Mode 1 image on a GT65 green monitor]]\nUnderlying a CPC's video output is the unusual pairing of a [[Cathode Ray Tube Controller|CRTC]] ([[Motorola 6845]] or compatible) with a custom-designed [[gate array]] to generate a pixel display output. CPC6128s later in production as well as the models from the plus range integrate both the CRTC and the gate array's functions with the system's [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]].\n\nThree built-in display resolutions are available: 160\u00d7200 pixels with 16 colours (\"Mode 0\", 20 text columns), 320\u00d7200 pixels with 4 colours (\"Mode 1\", 40 text columns), and 640\u00d7200 pixels with 2 colours (\"Mode 2\", 80 text columns).<ref name=\"464 Tech spec\"/> Increased screen size can be achieved by reprogramming the CRTC.\n\nThe original CPC video hardware supports a [[Palette (computing)|colour palette]] of 27 colours,<ref name=\"464 Tech spec\"/> generated from [[RGB]] colour space with each colour component assigned as either off, half on, or on. The plus range extended the palette to 4096 colours, also generated from RGB with 4 bits each for red, green and blue.<ref name=\"ArnoldVSpec\"/>\n\n[[File:Amstrad MP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Amstrad MP-1 module for CPC 464.|Amstrad MP1 external television adapter]]\nWith the exception of the GX4000, all CPC models lack an [[RF modulator|RF television]] or [[composite video]] output and instead shipped with a 6-pin RGB [[DIN connector]], also used by Acorn computers, to connect the supplied Amstrad monitor.<ref name=\"464 Tech spec\"/> This connector delivers a 1v p-p analogue RGB with a 50&nbsp;Hz composite sync signal that, if wired correctly, can drive a 50&nbsp;Hz [[SCART]] television. External adapters for RF television were available as a first-party hardware accessory.\n\n===Audio===\nThe CPC uses the [[General Instrument AY-3-8910|General Instrument AY-3-8912]] [[sound chip]],<ref name=\"464 Tech spec\"/> providing three channels, each configurable to generate square waves, white noise or both. A small array of hardware volume envelopes are available.\n\nOutput is provided in mono by a small (4&nbsp;cm) built-in loudspeaker with volume control, driven by an internal [[amplifier]]. [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]] output is provided through a {{nowrap|3.5 mm}} [[headphones]] jack.\n\nIt is possible to play back [[sampling (signal processing)|digital sound samples]] at a resolution of approximately 5-bit by sending a stream of values to the sound chip. This technique is very processor-intensive and hard to combine with any other processing. Examples are the title screens or other non-playable scenes of games like ''[[Chase H.Q.]]'', ''[[Meltdown (8-bit video game)|Meltdown]]'', and ''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|RoboCop]]''.  The later Plus models incorporated a DMA engine in order to offload this processing.\n\n===Floppy disk drive===\n[[File:Schneider CPC6128 Diskettenlaufwerk.jpg|thumb|Built-in disk drive of the CPC6128]]\n[[File:3 inch floppy disks.jpg|right|thumbnail|3&nbsp;inch floppy discs used on CPC machines]]\nAmstrad used [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi's]] [[Compact Floppy|3\" floppy disk drive]].<ref name=\"pountain198501\" /> The chosen drive (built-in for later models) is a single-sided 40-track unit that requires the user to physically remove and flip the disc to access the other side.<ref name=\"6128 Tech spec\"/> Each side has its own independent write-protect switch.<ref name=\"6128 Tech spec\"/> The sides are termed \"A\" and \"B\", with each one commonly formatted to 180&nbsp;KB (in [[AMSDOS]] format, comprising 2&nbsp;KB directory and 178&nbsp;KB storage) for a total of 360&nbsp;KB per disk.\n\nThe interface with the drives is a NEC 765 [[Floppy disk controller|FDC]], used for the same purpose in the IBM [[IBM Personal Computer XT|PC/XT]], [[PC/AT]] and [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] machines. Its features are not fully used in order to cut costs, namely [[Direct memory access|DMA]] transfers and support for [[single density]] disks; they were formatted as [[double density]] using [[modified frequency modulation]].\n\nDiscs were shipped in a paper sleeve or a hard plastic case resembling a [[compact disc]] \"jewel\" case. The casing is thicker and more rigid than that of 3.5&nbsp;inch diskettes, and designed to be mailed without any additional packaging{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. A sliding metal cover to protect the media surface is internal to the casing and latched, unlike the simple external sliding cover of Sony's version. They were significantly more expensive than both 5.25&nbsp;inch and 3.5&nbsp;inch alternatives. This, combined with their low nominal capacities and their essentially proprietary nature, led to the format being discontinued shortly after the CPC itself was discontinued.\n\nApart from Amstrad's other 3&nbsp;inch machines (the [[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] and the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum|ZX Spectrum +3]]), the few other computer systems to use them included the Sega SF-7000 and CP/M systems such as the [[Tatung Einstein]] and [[Osborne Computer Corporation|Osborne]] machines. They also found use on embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Shugart bus|Shugart]]-standard interface means that Amstrad CPC machines are able to use standard 3\", 3\u00bd\" or 5\u00bc\" drives as their second drive. Programs such as ROMDOS and ParaDOS extend the standard AMSDOS system to provide support for double-sided, 80-track formats, enabling up to 800&nbsp;KB to be stored on a single disk.\n\nThe 3&nbsp;inch disks themselves are usually known as \"discs\" on the CPC, following the spelling on the machine's plastic casing and conventional British English spelling.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:Amstrad CPC646-IMG 7196.jpg|thumb|Back of the case of a CPC 464, with the mini-jack, joystick and printer ports.]]\nThe hardware and firmware was designed to be able to access software provided on external ROMs. Each ROM has to be a 16&nbsp;kB block and is switched in and out of the memory space shared with the video RAM. The Amstrad firmware is deliberately designed so that new software could be easily accessed from these ROMs with a minimum of fuss. Popular applications were marketed on ROM, particularly word processing and programming utility software (examples are Protext and Brunword of the former, and the MAXAM assembler of the latter type).\n\nSuch extra ROM chips do not plug directly into the CPC itself, but into extra plug-in \"rom boxes\" which contain sockets for the ROM chips and a minimal amount of decoding circuitry for the main machine to be able to switch between them. These boxes were either marketed commercially or could be built by competent hobbyists and they attached to the main expansion port at the back of the machine. Software on ROM loads much faster than from disc or tape and the machine's boot-up sequence was designed to evaluate ROMs it found and optionally hand over control of the machine to them. This allows significant customization of the functionality of the machine, something that enthusiasts exploited for various purposes.<ref name=\"Amstrad CPC ROM expansion\">{{cite web |title=Amstrad CPC ROM expansion |url=http://8bit.yarek.pl/hardware/cpc.rom/index.html }}</ref> However, the typical users would probably not be aware of this added ROM functionality unless they read the CPC press, as it is not described in the user manual and was hardly ever mentioned in marketing literature. It is, however, documented in the official Amstrad firmware manual.\n\nThe machines also feature a 9-pin [[Atari joystick port]] that will either directly take one joystick, or two joysticks by use of a splitter cable.<ref name=\"464 Tech spec\"/>\n\n==Peripherals==\n\n===RS232 serial adapters===\nAmstrad issued two [[RS-232|RS-232-C]] [[D-subminiature|D25]] serial interfaces, attached to the expansion connector on the rear of the machine, with a through-connector for the CPC464 disk drive or other peripherals.\n\nThe original interface came with a ''Book of Spells'' for facilitating data transfer between other systems using a proprietary [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] in the device's own ROM, as well as [[computer terminal|terminal]] software to connect to British Telecom's [[Prestel]] service. A separate version of the ROM was created for the U.S. market due to the use of the commands \"|SUCK\" and \"|BLOW\", which were considered unacceptable there.\n\nSoftware and hardware limitations in this interface led to its replacement with an Amstrad-branded version of a compatible alternative by [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]]. Serial interfaces were also available from third-party vendors such as KDS Electronics and Cirkit.\n\n==Software==\n\n===BASIC and operating system===\n[[File:Amstrad CPC screen closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive BASIC on the Amstrad CPC 464]]\nLike most home computers at the time, the CPC has its [[operating system|OS]] and a [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] built in as [[read-only memory|ROM]]. It uses [[Locomotive BASIC]] - an improved version of Locomotive Software's Z80 BASIC for the [[BBC Microcomputer]] co-processor board. It is particularly notable for providing easy access to the machine's video and audio resources in contrast to the [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] commands required on generic Microsoft implementations. Other unusual features include timed event handling with the AFTER and EVERY commands, and text-based windowing.\n\n===CP/M===\n[[Digital Research]]'s [[CP/M]] operating system was supplied with the 664 and 6128 disk-based systems, and the DDI-1 disk expansion unit for the 464. 64k machines shipped with CP/M 2.2 alone, while the 128k machines also include CP/M 3.1. The compact CP/M 2.2 implementation is largely stored on the boot sectors of a 3\" disk in what was called \"System format\"; typing |CPM from Locomotive BASIC would load code from these sectors, making it a popular choice for custom game loading routines. The CP/M 3.1 implementation is largely in a separate file which is in turn loaded from the boot sector.\nMuch [[public domain]] CP/M software was made available for the CPC, from word-processors such as [[Video Display Editor|VDE]] to complete bulletin board systems such as ROS.\n\n===Other languages===\nAlthough it was possible to obtain compilers for Locomotive BASIC, [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], the majority of the CPC's software was written in native Z80 assembly language. Popular assemblers were Hisoft's Devpac, Arnor's Maxam, and (in France) DAMS. Disk-based CPC (not Plus) systems shipped with an interpreter for the educational language [[Logo programming language|LOGO]], booted from CP/M 2.2 but largely CPC-specific with much code resident in the AMSDOS ROM; 6128 machines also include a CP/M 3.1, non-ROM version. A C compiler was also written and made available for the European market through Tandy Europe, by Micro Business products.\n\n===''Roland''===\nIn an attempt to give the CPC a recognisable mascot, a number of games by Amstrad's in-house software publisher [[Amsoft]] have been tagged with the ''[[Roland (game character)|Roland]]'' name. However, as the games had not been designed around the Roland character and only had the branding added later, the character design varies immensely, from a spiky-haired blonde teenager (''Roland Goes Digging'') to a white cube with legs (''Roland Goes Square Bashing'') or a mutant flea (''[[La Pulga|Roland in the Caves]]''). The only two games with similar gameplay and main character design are ''Roland in Time'' and its sequel ''Roland in Space''. The Roland character was named after Roland Perry, one of the lead designers of the original CPC range.\n\n==Schneider Computer Division==\n[[File:Schneider Computer Division logo (horizontal).svg|thumb|right|Schneider Computer Division logo]]\n[[File:Schneider CPC6128 with green monitor GT65, keyboard.jpg|thumb|Schneider CPC6128 with visible micro ribbon connectors at the top (back) side]]\n[[File:Schneider CPC Demo Tape Pr\u00e4sentation Compact Cassette IMG 8687.JPG|thumb|Schneider CPC Demo Tape Presentation [[Compact Cassette]] came with the CPC464]]\nIn order to market its computers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where Amstrad did not have any distribution structures, Amstrad entered a partnership with ''[[Schneider Rundfunkwerke AG]]'', a German company that - very much like Amstrad itself - was previously only known for value-priced audio products. In 1984, Schneider's ''Schneider Computer Division'' daughter company was created specifically for the task, and the complete Amstrad CPC line-up was branded and sold as ''Schneider CPC''.\n\nAlthough they are based on the same hardware, the Schneider CPC models differ from the Amstrad CPC models in several details. Most prominently, the Schneider CPC464 and CPC664 keyboards featured grey instead of coloured keys, but still in the original British keyboard layout. To achieve a German \"QWERTZ\" keyboard layout, Schneider marketed a small software program to reassign the keys as well as sticker labels for the keys.<ref>''CPC Schneider International'' 6/85, P. 7</ref> In order to conform with stricter German [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] regulations, the complete Schneider CPC line-up is equipped with an internal metal shielding. For the same reason, the Schneider CPC6128 features [[micro ribbon]] type connectors instead of [[edge connector]]s. Both the greyscale keyboard and the micro ribbon connectors found their way up into the design of later Amstrad CPC models.\n\nIn 1988, after Schneider refused to market Amstrad's AT-compatible computer line, the cooperation ended. Schneider went on to sell the remaining stock of Schneider CPC models and used their now well-established market position to introduce its own PC designs. With the formation of its German daughter company ''Amstrad GmbH'' to distribute its product lines including the CPC464 and CPC6128, Amstrad attempted but ultimately failed to establish their own brand in the German-speaking parts of Europe.<ref>CeBIT '88, ''Schneider Magazin'' 5/88, P. 6-8</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Defunct Audio Manufacturers |url=http://audiotools.com/dead_s.html |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nThe Amstrad CPC enjoyed a strong and long lifetime, mainly due to the machines use for businesses as well as gaming. Dedicated programmers continued working on the CPC range, even producing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) operating systems such as [[SymbOS]]. Internet sites devoted to the CPC have appeared from around the world featuring forums, news, hardware, software, programming and games. CPC [[Computer magazine|Magazines]] appeared during the 1980s including publications in countries such as Britain, France, Spain, Germany, [[Denmark]], Australia, and [[Greece]]. Titles included the official [[Amstrad Computer User]] publication,<ref name=\"CPC UK magazines\">{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=CPC UK Magazines |work= |publisher=Nicholas Campbell |date= |url=http://users.durge.org/~nich/cpcmags/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031154629/http://users.durge.org/~nich/cpcmags/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 October 2001 |format= |doi= |accessdate=6 May 2008 }}</ref> as well as independent titles like ''[[Amstrad Action]]'',<ref name=\"CPC UK magazines\"/> ''[[Amtix!]]'',<ref name=\"CPC UK magazines\"/> ''[[Computing with the Amstrad CPC]]'',<ref name=\"CPC UK magazines\"/> ''[[CPC Attack]]'',<ref name=\"CPC UK magazines\"/> Australia's ''The Amstrad User'', France's ''Amstrad Cent Pour Cent'' and ''Amstar''. Following the CPC's end of production, Amstrad gave permission for the CPC ROMs to be distributed freely as long as the copyright message is not changed and that it is acknowledged that Amstrad still holds copyright, giving [[emulator]] authors the possibility to ship the CPC firmware with their programs.<ref name=\"Lawson emulation\">{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Cliff|authorlink=|title=Lawson emulation|work=|publisher=Cliff Lawson|date=|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/cpchomec.htm|doi=|accessdate=6 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510131526/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/cpchomec.htm|archivedate=10 May 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Influence on other Amstrad machines==\nAmstrad followed their success with the CPC 464 by launching the [[Amstrad PCW]] word-processor range, another Z80-based machine with a 3\" disk drive and software by [[Locomotive Software]]. The PCW was originally developed to be partly compatible with an improved version of the CPC (''ANT'', or Arnold Number Two - the CPC's development codename was Arnold){{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. However, Amstrad decided to focus on the PCW, and the ANT project never came to market.\n\nOn 7 April 1986 Amstrad announced it had bought from [[Sinclair Research]] \"...the worldwide rights to sell and manufacture all existing and future Sinclair computers and computer products, together with the Sinclair brand name and those intellectual property rights where they relate to computers and computer related products.\"<ref>[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/28/news.htm CRASH 28 - News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which included the [[ZX Spectrum]], for \u00a35 million.

This contrasts with [[synthetic geometry]].\n\nAnalytic geometry is widely used in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], and also in [[aviation]], [[rocket]]ry, [[space science]], and [[spaceflight]]. It is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry, including [[Algebraic geometry|algebraic]], [[Differential geometry|differential]], [[Discrete geometry|discrete]] and [[computational geometry]].\n\nUsually the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is applied to manipulate [[equation]]s for [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]s, [[Line (geometry)|straight line]]s, and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the [[Euclidean plane]] ([[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]]) and [[Euclidean space]] ([[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations. That the algebra of the [[real numbers]] can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the [[Cantor\u2013Dedekind axiom]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] mathematician [[Menaechmus]] solved problems and proved theorems by using a method that had a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates and it has sometimes been maintained that he had introduced analytic geometry.<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=The Age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=94\u201395|quote=Menaechmus apparently derived these properties of the conic sections and others as well. Since this material has a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates, as illustrated above, it has sometimes been maintained that Menaechmus had analytic geometry. Such a judgment is warranted only in part, for certainly Menaechmus was unaware that any equation in two unknown quantities determines a curve. In fact, the general concept of an equation in unknown quantities was alien to Greek thought. It was shortcomings in algebraic notations that, more than anything else, operated against the Greek achievement of a full-fledged coordinate geometry.}}</ref>\n\n[[Apollonius of Perga]], in ''[[Apollonius of Perga#De Sectione Determinata|On Determinate Section]]'', dealt with problems in a manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others.<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga |pages=142|quote=The Apollonian treatise ''On Determinate Section'' dealt with what might be called an analytic geometry of one dimension. It considered the following general problem, using the typical Greek algebraic analysis in geometric form: Given four points A, B, C, D on a straight line, determine a fifth point P on it such that the rectangle on AP and CP is in a given ratio to the rectangle on BP and DP. Here, too, the problem reduces easily to the solution of a quadratic; and, as in other cases, Apollonius treated the question exhaustively, including the limits of possibility and the number of solutions.}}</ref> Apollonius in the ''Conics'' further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of [[Descartes]] by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations of curves. However, although Apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry, he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve ''a posteriori'' instead of ''a priori''. That is, equations were determined by curves, but curves were not determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation.<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga |pages=156|quote=The method of Apollonius in the ''Conics'' in many respects are so similar to the modern approach that his work sometimes is judged to be an analytic geometry anticipating that of Descartes by 1800 years. The application of references lines in general, and of a diameter and a tangent at its extremity in particular, is, of course, not essentially different from the use of a coordinate frame, whether rectangular or, more generally, oblique. Distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. The Apollonian relationship between these abscissas and the corresponding ordinates are nothing more nor less than rhetorical forms of the equations of the curves. However, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed ''a posteriori'' upon a given curve in order to study its properties. There appear to be no cases in ancient geometry in which a coordinate frame of reference was laid down ''a priori'' for purposes of graphical representation of an equation or relationship, whether symbolically or rhetorically expressed. Of Greek geometry we may say that equations are determined by curves, but not that curves are determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions derived from a specific geometric situation; [...] That Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry, was probably the result of a poverty of curves rather than of thought. General methods are not necessary when problems concern always one of a limited number of particular cases.}}</ref>\n\n===Persia===\nThe 11th century [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] saw a strong relationship between geometry and algebra, and was moving in the right direction when he helped to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra<ref name=\"Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots\"/> with his geometric solution of the general [[cubic equation]]s,<ref>Glen M.

Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, \"Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance.

Four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates: (2,3) in green, (\u22123,1) in red, (\u22121.5,\u22122.5) in blue, and the origin (0,0) in purple.]]\n\nIn analytic geometry, the [[Euclidean plane|plane]] is given a coordinate system, by which every [[point (geometry)|point]] has a pair of [[real number]] coordinates. Similarly, [[Euclidean space]] is given coordinates where every point has three coordinates. The value of the coordinates depends on the choice of the initial point of origin. There are a variety of coordinate systems used, but the most common are the following:<ref name=stewart>[[James Stewart (mathematician)|Stewart, James]] (2008). ''Calculus: Early Transcendentals'', 6th ed., Brooks Cole Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|978-0-495-01166-8}}</ref>\n\n===Cartesian coordinates (in a plane or space)===\n{{main|Cartesian coordinate system}}\nThe most common coordinate system to use is the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], where each point has an ''x''-coordinate representing its horizontal position, and a ''y''-coordinate representing its vertical position.  These are typically written as an [[ordered pair]] (''x'',&nbsp;''y'').  This system can also be used for three-dimensional geometry, where every point in [[Euclidean space]] is represented by an [[Tuple|ordered triple]] of coordinates (''x'',&nbsp;''y'',&nbsp;''z'').\n\n===Polar coordinates (in a plane)===\n{{main|Polar coordinates}}\nIn [[polar coordinates]], every point of the plane is represented by its distance ''r'' from the origin and its [[angle]] ''\u03b8'' from the polar axis.\n\n===Cylindrical coordinates (in a space)===\n{{main|Cylindrical coordinates}}\nIn [[cylindrical coordinates]], every point of space is represented by its height ''z'', its [[radius]] ''r'' from the ''z''-axis and the [[angle]] ''\u03b8'' its projection on the ''xy''-plane makes with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n===Spherical coordinates (in a space)===\n{{main|Spherical coordinates}}\nIn [[spherical coordinates]], every point in space is represented by its distance ''\u03c1'' from the origin, the [[angle]] ''\u03b8'' its projection on the ''xy''-plane makes with respect to the horizontal axis, and the angle ''\u03c6'' that it makes with respect to the ''z''-axis. The names of the angles are often reversed in physics.<ref name=stewart/>\n\n==Equations and curves==\n{{main|Solution set|Locus (mathematics)}}\nIn analytic geometry, any [[equation]] involving the coordinates specifies a [[subset]] of the plane, namely the [[solution set]] for the equation, or [[locus (mathematics)|locus]].  For example, the equation ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' corresponds to the set of all the points on the plane whose ''x''-coordinate and ''y''-coordinate are equal.  These points form a [[line (geometry)|line]], and ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' is said to be the equation for this line.  In general, linear equations involving ''x'' and ''y'' specify lines, [[quadratic equation]]s specify [[conic section]]s, and more complicated equations describe more complicated figures.<ref name=intro>Percey Franklyn Smith, Arthur Sullivan Gale (1905)''Introduction to Analytic Geometry'', Athaeneum Press\n</ref>\n\nUsually, a single equation corresponds to a [[curve]] on the plane.  This is not always the case: the trivial equation ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' specifies the entire plane, and the equation ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 specifies only the single point (0,&nbsp;0).  In three dimensions, a single equation usually gives a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]], and a curve must be specified as the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two surfaces (see below), or as a system of [[parametric equation]]s.<ref>William H. McCrea, ''Analytic Geometry of Three Dimensions'' \nCourier Dover Publications, Jan 27, 2012</ref> The equation ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''<sup>2</sup> is the equation for any circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of r.\n\n===Lines and planes===\n{{main|Line (geometry)|Plane (geometry)}}\nLines in a [[Cartesian plane]] or, more generally, in [[affine coordinates]], can be described algebraically by ''linear'' equations. In two dimensions, the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the ''[[slope-intercept form]]'':\n:<math> y = mx + b \\,</math>\nwhere:\n: ''m'' is the [[slope]] or [[slope|gradient]] of the line.\n: ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the line.\n: ''x'' is the [[independent variable]] of the function ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').\n\nIn a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the [[normal vector]]) to indicate its \"inclination\".\n\nSpecifically, let <math>\\mathbf{r}_0</math> be the position vector of some point <math>P_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)</math>, and let <math>\\mathbf{n} = (a,b,c)</math> be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by this point and vector consists of those points <math>P</math>, with position vector <math>\\mathbf{r}</math>, such that the vector drawn from <math>P_0</math> to <math>P</math> is perpendicular to <math>\\mathbf{n}</math>. Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> such that\n:<math>\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0)=0.</math>\n(The dot here means a [[dot product]], not scalar multiplication.)\nExpanded this becomes\n:<math> a (x-x_0)+ b(y-y_0)+ c(z-z_0)=0,</math>\nwhich is the ''point-normal'' form of the equation of a plane.<ref>{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 155}}</ref> This is just a [[linear equation]]:\n:<math> ax + by + cz + d = 0, \\text{ where } d = -(ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0).</math>\nConversely, it is easily shown that if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are constants and ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are not all zero, then the graph of the equation \n::<math> ax + by + cz + d = 0,</math>\nis a plane having the vector <math>\\mathbf{n} = (a,b,c)</math> as a normal.<ref>{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 156}}</ref> This familiar equation for a plane is called the ''general form'' of the equation of the plane.<ref name=Weisstein2009>{{Citation\n  | title      = Plane\n  | url        = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane.html\n  | year       = 2009\n  | author     = Weisstein, Eric W.\n  | journal    = MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource\n  | accessdate = 2009-08-08\n  }}</ref>\n\nIn three dimensions, lines can ''not'' be described by a single linear equation, so they are frequently described by [[parametric equation]]s:\n:<math> x = x_0 + at \\,</math>\n:<math> y = y_0 + bt \\,</math>\n:<math> z = z_0 + ct \\,</math>\nwhere:\n: ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all functions of the independent variable ''t'' which ranges over the real numbers.\n: (''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''y''<sub>0</sub>, ''z''<sub>0</sub>) is any point on the line.\n: ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are related to the slope of the line, such that the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') is parallel to the line.\n\n===Conic sections===\n{{main|Conic section}}\nIn the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a [[quadratic equation]] in two variables is always a conic section \u2013 though it may be degenerate, and all conic sections arise in this way.

In coordinates {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>}}, the general quadric is defined by the [[algebraic equation]]<ref name=\"geom\">Silvio Levy [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/reference/CRC-formulas/node61.html Quadrics] in \"Geometry Formulas and Facts\", excerpted from 30th Edition of ''CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulas'', [[CRC Press]], from [[The Geometry Center]] at [[University of Minnesota]]</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} x_i Q_{ij} x_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P_i  x_i + R = 0.\n</math>\n\nQuadric surfaces include [[ellipsoid]]s (including the [[sphere]]), [[paraboloid]]s, [[hyperboloid]]s, [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[cones]], and [[plane (geometry)|planes]].\n\n==Distance and angle==\n{{main|Distance|Angle}}\n[[File:Distance Formula.svg|thumb|right|250px|The distance formula on the plane follows from the Pythagorean theorem.]]\n\nIn analytic geometry, geometric notions such as [[distance]] and [[angle]] measure are defined using [[formula]]s.  These definitions are designed to be consistent with the underlying [[Euclidean geometry]].  For example, using [[Cartesian coordinates]] on the plane, the distance between two points (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) is defined by the formula\n:<math>d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2},\\!</math>\nwhich can be viewed as a version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].  Similarly, the angle that a line makes with the horizontal can be defined by the formula\n:<math>\\theta = \\arctan(m),</math>\nwhere ''m'' is the [[slope]] of the line.\n\nIn three dimensions, distance is given by the generalization of the Pythagorean theorem:\n:<math>d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2+ (z_2 - z_1)^2},\\!</math>,\n\nwhile the angle between two vectors is given by the [[dot product]].

(think of the <math>x</math> as being dilated)\n*Changing <math>y</math> to <math>y/a</math> stretches the graph vertically.\n*Changing <math>x</math> to <math>x\\cos A+ y\\sin A</math> and changing <math>y</math> to <math>-x\\sin A + y\\cos A</math> rotates the graph by an angle <math>A</math>.\n\nThere are other standard transformation not typically studied in elementary analytic geometry because the transformations change the shape of objects in ways not usually considered.  Skewing is an example of a transformation not usually considered.\nFor more information, consult the Wikipedia article on [[affine transformations]].\n\nFor example, the parent function <math>y=1/x</math> has a horizontal and a vertical asymptote, and occupies the first and third quadrant, and all of its transformed forms have one horizontal and vertical asymptote, and occupies either the 1st and 3rd or 2nd and 4th quadrant. In general, if <math>y=f(x)</math>, then it can be transformed into <math>y=af(b(x-k))+h</math>. In the new transformed function, <math>a</math> is the factor that vertically stretches the function if it is greater than 1 or vertically compresses the function if it is less than 1, and for negative <math>a</math> values, the function is reflected in the <math>x</math>-axis. The <math>b</math> value compresses the graph of the function horizontally if greater than 1 and stretches the function horizontally if less than 1, and like <math>a</math>, reflects the function in the <math>y</math>-axis when it is negative. The <math>k</math> and <math>h</math> values introduce translations, <math>h</math>, vertical, and <math>k</math> horizontal. Positive <math>h</math> and <math>k</math> values mean the function is translated to the positive end of its axis and negative meaning translation towards the negative end.\n\nTransformations can be applied to any geometric equation whether or not the equation represents a function.\nTransformations can be considered as individual transactions or in combinations.\n\nSuppose that <math>R(x,y)</math> is a relation in the <math>xy</math> plane.  For example,\n\n:<math>x^2+y^2-1=0</math>\n\nis the relation that describes the unit circle.\n\n==Finding intersections of geometric objects==\n{{main|Intersection (geometry)}}\nFor two geometric objects P and Q represented by the relations <math>P(x,y)</math> and <math>Q(x,y)</math> the intersection is the collection of all points <math>(x,y)</math> which are in both relations.<ref>While this discussion is limited to the xy-plane, it can easily be extended to higher dimensions.</ref>\n\nFor example, <math>P</math> might be the circle with radius 1 and center <math>(0,0)</math>:  <math>P = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2=1\\}</math> and <math>Q</math> might be the circle with radius 1 and center <math>(1,0): Q = \\{(x,y) | (x-1)^2+y^2=1\\}</math>.  The intersection of these two circles is the collection of points which make both equations true.  Does the point <math>(0,0)</math> make both equations true?   Using <math>(0,0)</math> for <math>(x,y)</math>, the equation for <math>Q</math> becomes <math>(0-1)^2+0^2=1</math> or <math>(-1)^2=1</math> which is true, so <math>(0,0)</math> is in the relation <math>Q</math>.  On the other hand, still using <math>(0,0)</math> for <math>(x,y)</math> the equation for <math>P</math> becomes <math>0^2+0^2=1</math> or <math>0=1</math> which is false.  <math>(0,0)</math> is not in <math>P</math> so it is not in the intersection.\n\nThe intersection of <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> can be found by solving the simultaneous equations:\n\n:<math>x^2+y^2 = 1</math>\n\n:<math>(x-1)^2+y^2 = 1.</math>\n\nTraditional methods for finding intersections include substitution and elimination.\n\n'''Substitution:'''  Solve the first equation for <math>y</math> in terms of <math>x</math> and then substitute the expression for <math>y</math> into the second equation:\n\n:<math>x^2+y^2 = 1</math>\n\n:<math>y^2=1-x^2</math>.\n\nWe then substitute this value for <math>y^2</math> into the other equation and proceed to solve for <math>x</math>:\n\n:<math>(x-1)^2+(1-x^2)=1</math>\n\n:<math>x^2 -2x +1 +1 -x^2 =1</math>\n\n:<math>-2x = -1</math>\n\n:<math>x=1/2.</math>\n\nNext, we place this value of <math>x</math> in either of the original equations and solve for <math>y</math>:\n\n:<math>(1/2)^2+y^2 = 1</math>\n\n:<math>y^2 =3/4</math>\n\n:<math>y = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{3}}{2}.</math>\n\nSo our intersection has two points:\n\n:<math> \\left(1/2,\\frac{+ \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\;\\;  \\mathrm{and} \\;\\;  \\left(1/2,\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right). </math>\n\n'''Elimination''':  Add (or subtract) a multiple of one equation to the other equation so that one of the variables is eliminated. For our current example, if we subtract the first equation from the second we get <math>(x-1)^2-x^2=0</math>. The <math>y^2</math> in the first equation is subtracted from the <math>y^2</math> in the second equation leaving no <math>y</math> term. The variable <math>y</math> has been eliminated. We then solve the remaining equation for <math>x</math>, in the same way as in the substitution method:\n\n:<math>x^2 -2x +1 +1 -x^2 =1 </math>\n\n:<math>-2x = -1</math>\n\n:<math>x=1/2.</math>\n\nWe then place this value of <math>x</math> in either of the original equations and solve for <math>y</math>:\n\n:<math>(1/2)^2+y^2 = 1</math>\n\n:<math>y^2 = 3/4</math>\n\n:<math>y = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{3}}{2}.</math>\n\nSo our intersection has two points:\n\n:<math> \\left(1/2,\\frac{+ \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\;\\;  \\mathrm{and} \\;\\; \\left(1/2,\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right). </math>\n\nFor conic sections, as many as 4 points might be in the intersection.\n\n===Finding intercepts===\n{{main|x-intercept|y-intercept}}\nOne type of intersection which is widely studied is the intersection of a geometric object with the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> coordinate axes.\n\nThe intersection of a geometric object and the <math>y</math>-axis is called the <math>y</math>-intercept of the object.\nThe intersection of a geometric object and the <math>x</math>-axis is called the <math>x</math>-intercept of the object.\n\nFor the line <math>y=mx+b</math>, the parameter <math>b</math> specifies the point where the line crosses the <math>y</math> axis. Depending on the context, either <math>b</math> or the point <math>(0,b)</math> is called the <math>y</math>-intercept.\n\n==Tangents and normals==\n\n===Tangent lines and planes===\n{{main|Tangent}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''tangent line''' (or simply '''tangent''') to a plane [[curve]] at a given [[Point (geometry)|point]] is the [[straight line]] that \"just touches\" the curve at that point. Informally, it is a line through a pair of [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a point {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''c''}} on the curve if the line passes through the point {{nowrap|(''c'', ''f''(''c''))}} on the curve and has slope {{nowrap|''f''{{'}}(''c'')}} where ''f''{{'}} is the [[derivative]] of ''f''. A similar definition applies to [[space curve]]s and curves in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].\n\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the '''point of tangency''', the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\n\nSimilarly, the '''tangent plane''' to a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] at a given point is the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in [[differential geometry]] and has been extensively generalized; see [[Tangent space]].\n\n===Normal line and vector===\n{{main|Normal (geometry)}}\nIn [[geometry]], a '''normal''' is an object such as a line or vector that is [[perpendicular]] to a given object. For example, in the two-dimensional case, the '''normal line''' to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the [[tangent line]] to the curve at the point.\n\nIn the three-dimensional case a '''surface normal''', or simply '''normal''', to a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] at a point ''P'' is a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] that is [[perpendicular]] to the [[Tangent space|tangent plane]] to that surface at ''P''. The word \"normal\" is also used as an adjective: a [[line (geometry)|line]] normal to a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], the normal component of a [[force]], the '''normal vector''', etc. The concept of '''normality''' generalizes to [[orthogonality]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Linear equation]]\n*[[Vector space]]\n*[[Cross product]]\n*[[Algebraic geometry]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n*{{citation|last=Boyer|first=Carl B.|title=History of Analytic Geometry|year=2004|origyear=1956|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486438320}}\n*{{citation|last=Cajori|first=Florian|title=A History of Mathematics|publisher=AMS|isbn=978-0821821022}}\n* [[John Casey (mathematician)|John Casey]] (1885) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924001520455 Analytic Geometry of the Point, Line, Circle, and Conic Sections], link from [[Internet Archive]].\n*{{citation|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|title=A History of Mathematics: An Introduction (2nd Ed.)|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|place=Reading|year=1998|isbn=0-321-01618-1}}\n*{{citation|last=Struik|first=D.

It is written from right to left in a [[cursive]] style and includes 28 letters. Most letters have contextual letterforms.\n\nOriginally, the alphabet was an abjad, with only [[consonant]]s, but it is now considered an \"[[impure abjad]]\". As with other ''abjads'', such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]], scribes later devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel [[diacritics]].\n\n==Consonants==\nThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 [[letter (alphabet)|letters]]. Adaptations of the [[Arabic script]] for other languages added and removed some letters, as for [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Jawi script|Malay]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Arwi]] and [[Malayalam]] ([[Arabi Malayalam]]), all of which have additional letters as shown below. There are no distinct [[letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms.\n\nMany letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics#I.27jam .28phonetic distinctions of consonants.29|\u02bei\u02bfj\u0101m]]}}'') above or below their central part (''{{transl|ar|[[rasm]]}}''). These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters \u0628 (b), \u062a (t), and \u062b (th) have the same basic shape, but have one dot below, two dots above, and three dots above; the letter \u0646 (n) also has the same form in initial and medial forms, with one dot above, though it is somewhat different in isolated and final form.\n\nBoth printed and written Arabic are [[cursive]], with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.\n\n===Alphabetical order===\nThere are two main [[collation|collating sequences]] for the Arabic alphabet: abjad and hija.\n\nThe original ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012by}}'' order ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0651}}), used for [[lettering]], derives from the order of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. In this order, letters are also used as numbers, [[Abjad numerals]], and possess the same alphanumeric code/[[cipher]] as Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]].\n\nThe ''{{transl|ar|hij\u0101\u2019\u012b}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0647\u0650\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a}}) or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alifb\u0101\u02be\u012b}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0641\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a}}) order, used where lists of names and words are sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries, groups letters by similarity of shape.\n\n==== Abjad\u012b ====\nThe ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012b}}'' order is not a simple historical continuation of the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, since it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter ''[[samekh]]/semkat'' {{lang|he|\u05e1}}, yet no letter of the Arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter. Loss of ''{{transl|he|same\u1e35}}'' was compensated for by the split of ''[[shin (letter)|shin]]'' {{lang|he|\u05e9}} into two independent Arabic letters, {{lang|ar|\u0634}} (''sh\u012bn'') and {{lang|ar|\ufeb1}} (''s\u012bn'') which moved up to take the place of ''{{transl|he|same\u1e35}}''. The six other letters that do not correspond to any north Semitic letter are placed at the end.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Common ''{{transl|ar|ALA|abjad\u012b}}'' sequence\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|\u063a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0638}} || {{lang|ar|\u0636}} || {{lang|ar|\u0630}} || {{lang|ar|\u062e}} || {{lang|ar|\u062b}} || {{lang|ar|\u062a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0634}} || {{lang|ar|\u0631}} || {{lang|ar|\u0642}} || {{lang|ar|\u0635}} || {{lang|ar|\u0641}} || {{lang|ar|\u0639}} || {{lang|ar|\u0633}} || {{lang|ar|\u0646}} || {{lang|ar|\u0645}} || {{lang|ar|\u0644}} || {{lang|ar|\u0643}} || {{lang|ar|\u064a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0637}} || {{lang|ar|\u062d}} || {{lang|ar|\u0632}} || {{lang|ar|\u0648}} || {{lang|ar|\u0647}} || {{lang|ar|\u062f}} || {{lang|ar|\u062c}} || {{lang|ar|\u0628}} || {{lang|ar|\u0623}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e93}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e0d}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e63}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || '''{{transl|ar|\u02bf}}''' || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e6d}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e25}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|\u02be}}\n|- style=\"color:gray\"\n| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01\n|-\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow  |\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n|}\n\nThis is commonly vocalized as follows:\n: ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad hawwaz \u1e25u\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012b kalaman sa\u02bffa\u1e63 qarashat thakhadh \u1e0da\u1e93agh}}''.\nAnother vocalization is:\n: ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabujadin hawazin \u1e25u\u1e6diya kalman sa\u02bffa\u1e63 qurishat thakhudh \u1e0da\u1e93ugh}}''{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[Maghreb]]ian ''{{transl|ar|abjad\u012b}}'' sequence (probably older)<ref name=magb>{{ar icon}} [http://alyaseer.net/vb/showthread.php?t=8807 Alyaseer.net {{lang|ar|\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0629}} Ordering entries and cards in subject indexes] Discussion thread ''(Accessed 2009-October\u201306)''</ref>\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|\u0634}} || {{lang|ar|\u063a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0638}} || {{lang|ar|\u0630}} || {{lang|ar|\u062e}} || {{lang|ar|\u062b}} || {{lang|ar|\u062a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0633}} || {{lang|ar|\u0631}} || {{lang|ar|\u0642}} || {{lang|ar|\u0636}} || {{lang|ar|\u0641}} || {{lang|ar|\u0639}} || {{lang|ar|\u0635}} || {{lang|ar|\u0646}} || {{lang|ar|\u0645}} || {{lang|ar|\u0644}} || {{lang|ar|\u0643}} || {{lang|ar|\u064a}} || {{lang|ar|\u0637}} || {{lang|ar|\u062d}} || {{lang|ar|\u0632}} || {{lang|ar|\u0648}} || {{lang|ar|\u0647}} || {{lang|ar|\u062f}} || {{lang|ar|\u062c}} || {{lang|ar|\u0628}} || {{lang|ar|\u0623}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e93}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e0d}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || '''{{transl|ar|\u02bf}}''' || {{transl|ar|\u1e63}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e6d}} || {{transl|ar|\u1e25}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|\u02be}}\n|- style=\"color:gray\"|\n| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01\n|-\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n|}\n\nThis can be vocalized as:\n: ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabujadin hawazin \u1e25u\u1e6diya kalman \u1e63a\u02bffa\u1e0d qurisat thakhudh \u1e93aghush}}''\n\n==== Hij\u0101\u02be\u012b ====\nModern dictionaries and other reference books do not use the ''{{transl|ar|abjad\u012b}}'' order to sort alphabetically; instead, the newer ''{{transl|ar|hij\u0101\u02be\u012b}}'' order is used wherein letters are partially grouped together by similarity of shape.

Letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position ([[IMFI]]). While some letters show considerable variations, others remain almost identical across all four positions. Generally, letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines, but six letters ({{lang|ar|\u0648 ,\u0632 ,\u0631 ,\u0630 ,\u062f ,\u0627}}) can only be linked to their preceding letter. For example, {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a}} ([[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) has only isolated forms because each letter cannot be connected to its following one. In addition, some letter combinations are written as [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] (special shapes), notably ''{{transl|ar|l\u0101m-alif}}'' {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0627}},<ref>{{cite book |title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach |author=Rogers, Henry |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |page=135}}</ref> which is the only mandatory ligature (the un-ligated combination {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0640\u0627}} is considered difficult to read).\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n\n====Table of basic letters====\n{{other uses|Arabic script}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Arabic letters usage in Literary Arabic\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Common\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Maghreb]]ian\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter<br/>name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter<br/>name in Arabic script\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Romanization of Arabic|Trans-<br/>literation]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Value in Literary Arabic ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Closest English equivalent in pronunciation\n!colspan=\"3\"|Contextual forms\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Isolated<br/>form\n|-\n!\u02beAbjad\u012b !!

transliteration schemes; however, Arabic language speakers may usually not follow a standardized scheme when transcribing names. Also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally, not as pronounced in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (if they were of Arabic origin).\n*Regarding pronunciation, the phonemic values given are those of Modern Standard Arabic, which is taught in schools and universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the articles ''[[Arabic phonology]]'' and ''[[varieties of Arabic]]''.\n*The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the [[Proto-Semitic]] language. Names of Arabic letters may have quite different names popularly.\n*Six letters ({{lang|ar|\u0648 \u0632 \u0631 \u0630 \u062f \u0627}}) do not have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form. The following letter is written in its initial form, or isolated form if it is the final letter in the word.\n* The letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' originated in the [[Phoenician alphabet]] as a consonant-sign indicating a glottal stop. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ya\u2019}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', is a ''[[mater lectionis]]'', a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (''{{transl|ar|ALA|maddah}}'' and ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'').\n* Arabic currently uses a [[diacritic]] sign, {{lang|ar|\u0621}}, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'', to denote the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, written alone or with a carrier:\n** alone: {{lang|ar|\u0621}}\n** with a carrier: {{lang|ar|\u0625 \u0623}} (above or under a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''), {{lang|ar|\u0624}} (above a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''), {{lang|ar|\u0626}} (above a dotless ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019 hamzah}}'').\n\n:In academic work, the ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0621}}) is transliterated with the [[modifier letter right half ring]] (\u02be), while the [[modifier letter left half ring]] (\u02bf) transliterates the letter ''[[Ayin|{{transl|ar|ALA|\u2018ayn}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0639}}), which represents a different sound, not found in English.\n\n::The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes combined with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'', and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u2019}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n====Alif ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a ''W''-shaped sign called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}'', above it. Note that if a vowel occurs between the two consonants the letter will simply be written twice. The [[diacritic]] only appears where the consonant at the end of one syllable is identical to the initial consonant of the following syllable. (The generic term for such [[diacritic]]al signs is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[harakat|\u1e25arak\u0101t]]}}'').\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!General<br />Unicode\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Transliteration\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0651</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&nbsp;&#x0651;}}</span>\n|{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}\n|<big>\u0634\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0629</big>\n|(consonant doubled)\n|}\n\n====Nunation====\n{{Main article|Nunation}}\n\nNunation ({{lang-ar|\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0646}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tanw\u012bn}}'') is the addition of a final ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-n}}''&nbsp; to a [[noun]] or [[adjective]]. The vowel before it indicates [[grammatical case]]. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel [[diacritic]] at the end of the word.\n\n== Vowels ==\nUsers of Arabic usually write [[vowel length|long vowels]] but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Qur\u2019\u0101n}}'' the three basic vowel signs (see below) are mandated, like the ''[[Arabic diacritics|\u1e25arak\u0101t]]'' and all the other diacritics or other types of marks, for example the [[Cantillation|cantillation signs]].\n\n===Short vowels===\n{{Further information|Arabic diacritics}}\n\nIn the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Quran|Qur\u2019\u0101n]]}}'' cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included. Children's books, elementary school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree. These are known as \"[[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]]\" texts.\n\nShort vowels may be written with [[diacritic]]s placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e25arak\u0101t}}''. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like \"Ali\" or \"alif\", for example, start with a consonant: ''{{transl|ar|\u2018Aliyy}}''<!--not DIN 31635 transliteration-->, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Short vowels<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Code\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Trans.\n!Value\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&#160;&#x064E;}}</span>\n|<small>064E</small>\n|fat\u00b7\u1e25ah\n|\u0641\u064e\u062a\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0629\n|''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}''\n|{{IPA|/a/}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&#160;&#x064F;}}</span>\n|<small>064F</small>\n|{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e0dammah}}\n|\u0636\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0629\n|''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}''\n|{{IPA|/u/}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&#160;&#x0650;}}</span>\n|<small>0650</small>\n|{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}\n|\u0643\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\n|''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}''\n|{{IPA|/i/}}\n|}\n\n===Long vowels===\nIn the fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] Arabic text found in texts such as [[Quran]], a long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u0101}}'' following a consonant other than a ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'' is written with a short ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' sign (''{{transl|ar|ALA|fat\u1e25ah}}'') on the consonant plus an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bealif}}'' after it; long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u012b}}'' is written as a sign for short ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'') plus a {{transl|ar|ALA|''y\u0101\u02be''}}; and long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b}}'' as a sign for short ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e0dammah}}'') plus a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''.

For clarity in the table, the primary letters on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form.

In others, these ''y'' and ''w'' carry a ''suk\u016bn''. Outside of the ''Qur\u2019\u0101n'', the latter convention is extremely rare, to the point that ''y'' with ''suk\u016bn'' will be unambiguously read as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/aj/}}, and ''w'' with ''suk\u016bn'' will be read {{IPA|/aw/}}.\n\nFor example, the letters ''{{transl|ar|m-y-l}}'' can be read like English ''meel'' or ''mail'', or (theoretically) also like ''mayyal'' or ''mayil''. But if a ''suk\u016bn'' is added on the ''y'' then the ''m'' cannot have a ''suk\u016bn'' (because two letters in a row cannot be ''suk\u016bn''ated), cannot have a ''\u1e0dammah'' (because there is never an ''uy'' sound in Arabic unless there is another vowel after the ''y''), and cannot have a ''kasrah'' (because ''kasrah'' before ''suk\u016bn''ated ''y'' is never found outside the ''Qur\u2019\u0101n''), so it ''must'' have a ''fat\u1e25ah'' and the only possible pronunciation is {{IPA|/majl/}} (meaning mile, or even e-mail). By the same token, m-y-t with a ''suk\u016bn'' over the ''y'' can be ''mayt'' but not ''mayyit'' or ''meet'', and m-w-t with a ''suk\u016bn'' on the ''w'' can only be ''mawt'', not ''moot'' (''iw'' is impossible when the ''w'' closes the syllable).\n\nVowel marks are always written as if the ''[[\u2019I\u2018rab|i\u2018r\u0101b]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced, even when they must be skipped in actual pronunciation. So, when writing the name ''A\u1e25mad'', it is optional to place a ''suk\u016bn'' on the ''\u1e25'', but a ''suk\u016bn'' is forbidden on the ''d'', because it would carry a ''\u1e0dammah'' if any other word followed, as in ''A\u1e25madu zawj\u012b'' \"Ahmad is my husband\".\n\nAnother example: the sentence that in correct literary Arabic must be pronounced ''A\u1e25madu zawjun sharr\u012br'' \"Ahmad is a wicked husband\", is usually mispronounced (due to influence from vernacular Arabic varieties) as ''A\u1e25mad zawj sharr\u012br''. Yet, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were ''A\u1e25madu zawjun sharr\u012brun'' with a ''tanw\u012bn'' 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add an ''un'' ''tanw\u012bn'' sign on the final ''r'', but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a ''suk\u016bn'' on that ''r'', even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) ''suk\u016bn''ed.\n\nOf course, if the correct ''i\u2018r\u0101b'' is a ''suk\u016bn'', it may be optionally written.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!General<br />Unicode\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Translit.\n!Phonemic Value (IPA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0652</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&nbsp;&#x0652;}}</span>\n|suk\u016bn\n|\u0633\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\n|(no vowel with this consonant letter or<br />diphthong with this long vowel letter)\n|\u2205\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0670</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&nbsp;&#x0670;}}</span>\n|alif khanjariyyah [dagger \u2019alif - smaller \u2019alif written above consonant]\n| \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0641 \u062e\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\n|''\u0101''\n|{{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}\n|}\n\nThe ''suk\u016bn'' is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script.

In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western Arabic numerals are used. Like Western Arabic numerals, in Eastern Arabic numerals, the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most.\n\n===Letters as numerals===\n{{main article|Abjad numerals}}\n\nIn addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]). This usage is based on the ''{{transl|ar|\u02beabjad\u012b}}'' order of the alphabet. {{lang|ar|\u0623}} ''{{transl|ar|\u02bealif}}'' is 1, {{lang|ar|\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|b\u0101\u02be}}'' is 2, {{lang|ar|\u062c}} ''{{transl|ar|j\u012bm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{lang|ar|\u064a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' = 10, {{lang|ar|\u0643}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k\u0101f}}'' = 20, {{lang|ar|\u0644}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|l\u0101m}}'' = 30, \u2026, {{lang|ar|\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|r\u0101\u02be}}'' = 200, \u2026, {{lang|ar|\u063a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ghayn}}'' = 1000. This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of the Arabic alphabet}}\n[[File:Arabic script evolution.svg|thumb|250px|Evolution of early [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] (9th\u201311th century). The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Basmala]]}}'' is taken as an example, from [[Kufic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Qur\u2019\u0101n]]}}'' manuscripts. (1) Early 9th century script used no dots or [[diacritic]] marks;<ref>[[commons:File:Basmala kufi.svg|File:Basmala kufi.svg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref> (2) and (3) in the 9th\u201310th century during the Abbasid dynasty, [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali|Abu al-Aswad]]'s system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel. Later, a second system of black dots was used to differentiate between letters like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f\u0101\u2019}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q\u0101f}}'';<ref name=\"wikimedia1\">[[commons:File:Kufi.jpg|File:Kufi.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref><ref name=\"wikimedia1\"/> (4) in the 11th century ([[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b]]'s system) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels. This system is the one used today.<ref>[[commons:File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref>]]\nThe Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabataean alphabet]] used to write the [[Nabataean]]. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription from ''{{transl|ar|[[Jabal Ramm]]}}'' (50&nbsp;km east of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Aqaba|\u2018Aqabah]]}}'') in [[Jordan]], but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} However, the [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them. (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous [[Book Pahlavi|Pahlavi]] alphabet.) The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts were and still are frequently memorized, especially in [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Qur\u02bean memorization]], a practice which probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLater still, vowel marks and the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the 7th century, preceding the first invention of [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Tiberian vocalization|Hebrew vocalization]]. Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned in the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] era by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] a dot above = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', and doubled dots indicated [[nunation]]. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[al-Farahidi|al-Far\u0101h\u012bd\u012b]]}}''.\n\n=== Arabic printing presses ===\nAlthough [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to [[Egypt]] during his invasion of that country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and [[Arabic script]] presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper ''Al-Tanbiyyah'' (\"The Courier\"), printing in the Arabic language started several centuries earlier.\n\nIn 1514, following [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published an entire prayer-book in Arabic script; it was entitled ''[[Kitab salat al-sawai|Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i]]'' and was intended for eastern Christian communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viverefano.com/2014/11/19/294-anniversario-della-biblioteca-federiciana-ricerche-e-curiosit-sul-kitab-salat-al-sawai/504874/|title=294\u00b0 anniversario della Biblioteca Federiciana: ricerche e curiosit\u00e0 sul Kitab Salat al-Sawai|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1580 and 1586, type designer [[Robert Granjon]] designed Arabic typefaces for Cardinal [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]], and the [[Medici Oriental Press|Medici press]] published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n[[Maronite]] monks at the Maar Quzhayy Monastery in [[Mount Lebanon]] published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East. The monks transliterated the Arabic language using [[Syriac language|Syriac]] script.\n\nA goldsmith (like Gutenberg) designed and implemented an Arabic-script movable-type printing-press in the Middle East. The [[Greek Orthodox]] monk [[Abd Allah Zakhir]] set up an [[Arabic]] [[printing press]] using [[movable type]] at the monastery of Saint John at the town of [[Dhour El Shuwayr]] in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the typeface. The first book came off his press in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm Arabic and the Art of Printing \u2013 A Special Section], by Paul Lunde\n</ref>\n\n== Computers ==\nThe Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]], [[Windows-1256]] and [[Unicode]] (see links in Infobox above), latter thanks to the \"Arabic segment\", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, none of the sets indicates the form that each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.\n\nEach letter has a position-independent encoding in [[Unicode]], and the rendering software can infer the correct glyph form (initial, medial, final or isolated) from its joining context. That is the current recommendation. However, for compatibility with previous standards, the initial, medial, final and isolated forms can also be encoded separately.\n\n===Unicode===\n{{Main article|Arabic characters in Unicode}}\nAs of [[Unicode]] 11.0, the [[Arabic script]] is contained in the following [[Unicode block|blocks]]:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Scripts.txt | work=Unicode Character Database | title=UAX #24: Script data file | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}</ref>\n*[[Arabic (Unicode block)|Arabic]] (0600\u201306FF, 255 characters)\n*[[Arabic Supplement]] (0750\u2013077F, 48 characters)\n*[[Arabic Extended-A]] (08A0\u201308FF, 74 characters)\n*[[Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] (FB50\u2013FDFF, 611 characters)\n*[[Arabic Presentation Forms-B]] (FE70\u2013FEFF, 141 characters)\n*[[Rumi Numeral Symbols]] (10E60\u201310E7F, 31 characters)\n*[[Indic Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Indic Siyaq Numbers]] (1EC70\u20131ECBF, 68 characters)\n*[[Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols]] (1EE00&mdash;1EEFF, 143 characters)\n\nThe basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on [[ISO 8859-6]]). It also includes the most common diacritics and [[Arabic-Indic digits]]. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as \"end of ''[[ayah]]''\" \u06dd\u06d6 and \"start of ''[[Rub El Hizb|rub el hizb]]''\" \u06de. The Arabic supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Extended-A range encodes additional Qur'anic annotations and letter variants used for various non-Arabic languages.\n\nThe Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms. The Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block encodes characters used in Arabic mathematical expressions.\n\nSee also the notes of the section on [[#Modified letters|modified letters]].\n\n===Keyboards===\n{{see also|Keyboard layout}}\n\n[[File:KB Arabic MAC.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic Mac keyboard layout]]\n[[File:KB Arabic.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic PC keyboard layout]]\n[[File:Intellark4qwerty.png|thumb|450px|[[Intellark]] imposed on a QWERTY keyboard layout.]]\n\nKeyboards designed for different nations have different layouts so proficiency in one style of keyboard, such as Iraq's, does not transfer to proficiency in another, such as Saudi Arabia's. Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters.\n\nAll Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a [[web browser]]. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the [[QWERTY]] layout, but in [[North Africa]], where [[French language|French]] is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are [[AZERTY]].\n\nTo encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The range ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode by using the ''[[zero-width joiner]]'' and ''[[zero-width non-joiner|non-joiner]]'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.\n\nFinally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's [[bi-directional text]] features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out of date.<ref>For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at [https://www.unicode.org/ The Unicode website]</ref><ref>See also [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf Multilingual Computing with Arabic and Arabic Transliteration: Arabicizing Windows Applications to Read and Write Arabic & Solutions for the Transliteration Quagmire Faced by Arabic-Script Languages] and [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/multilingual_computing_arabic.ppt A PowerPoint Tutorial (with screen shots and an English voice-over) on how to add Arabic to the Windows Operating System]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911024303/https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThere are competing online tools, e.g. [http://www.yamli.com/editor/ Yamli editor], which allow entry of Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC, and without knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.<ref>[http://www.yamli.com/press/ Yamli in the News]</ref>\n\n===Handwriting recognition===\nThe first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time was developed by researchers at [[Ben-Gurion University]] (BGU).\n\nThe prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second.

Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,<ref>Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in ''[[La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2\u201316 August 2008), pp. 327-328.</ref> as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].\n\nIn a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the angel, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the coemeterium majus, substitutes the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for the heavenly messenger.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01485a.htm Hassett, Maurice. \"Early Christian Representations of Angels.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Dec. 2013]</ref>\n\nThe earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarig\u00fczel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).<ref>Proverbio(2007) p. 66</ref>  Flying winged angels, very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject, are derivations in visual terms from pairs of [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] in classical art.<ref name=marshall/>\n\nIn this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: \"They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature.\"<ref>Proverbio(2007) p. 34</ref>\n\nFrom then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-440).<ref>Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in ''[[La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2\u201316 August 2008), pp. 327-328.</ref>  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art, and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.\n\n===Byzantine art===\n[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''[[loros]]'' of the Imperial guards.]]\n\nAngels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as \"Victory\". They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus, having light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as the \"comely features and fine bodies\" desired by slave traders.<ref name=brown/>  Those \"castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards,....\" As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  \"Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch\".<ref name=brown>[https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture Brown, Amelia R., \"Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture\", University of Queensland (2007)]</ref>\n\nDaniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold.<ref name=longhurst/> Angels, especially the archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''[[loros]]'', a long gold and jewelled  [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards, and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West, and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.\n\n===Medieval art===\nMedieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'', Gabriel wears a dalmatic.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QQFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA54 Andre, J. Lewis. \"The Icons and Emblems of the Holy Angels\", ''The Belfry: Quarterly Papers on Art, History and Archaeology'', No. III, Burns & Oates, London, October 1876,]</ref> In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]. This indicated that, for all their powers, they could not perform the [[Eucharist]], and were in this respect outranked by every priest, reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In [[Early Christian art]] white robes were almost invariably adopted, sometimes bound with the \"golden girdle\" of Revelation. During the medi\u00e6val period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour,<ref name=vinycomb>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca08.htm Vinycomb, John. ''Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art'', p.30, Chapman and Hall, London(1909)]</ref> while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Fra Angelico]] painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty, as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.<ref name=gorgievski/>\n\n===Renaissance art===\n[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|left|Fra Angelico, The Annunciation, 1437-46]]\nThe classical ''[[erotes]]'' or ''[[putto]]'' re-appeared in art during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in both religious and mythological art, and is often known in English as a [[cherub]], the singular of cherubim, actually one of the higher ranks in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art, and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance, except that they may be amusing Christ or [[John the Baptist]] as infants in scenes of the [[Holy Family]].\n\n===Victorian art===\nIn the late 19th century artists' model [[Jane Morris|Jane Burden Morris]] came to embody an ideal of beauty for [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous, they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and others used her image often and in different ways, creating a new type of angel.<ref>[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000614.php Homan, Roger. \"Jane Burden: How a Pre-Raphaelite model changed our image of angels\", ''The Social Affairs Unit'', 14 October 2005]</ref>\n\n== Islamic art ==\nAccording to Islamic teaching, angels are made of light, are beautiful, and have wings; although the shape and form of the wings are unknown.<ref>[http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php Islamic Resource & Information Service (IRIS), New Zealand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410081112/http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php |date=10 April 2012 }}</ref> In [[Islamic art]] angels mainly appear mainly in narrative scenes in miniature painting, in the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman]] traditions.  They are especially common in illustrations of the Prophet's [[Mi'raj]], one of the occasions where their presence is mentioned in the [[Quran]].  Their appearance generally draws more from the [[iconography]] of pre-Islamic Persia, and [[Buddhist art]], than from angels in Christian art. Some of the earliest [[Ilkhanid]] examples are exceptions to this.  They have wings, often multi-coloured,<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/angels-fly-on-high-multicolored-wings.aspx?pageID=238&nID=27524&NewsCatID=438 Gamm, Niki. Angels fly on high multicolored wings\", ''Hurriyit Daily News'' Istanbul, Turkey, 11 August 2012]</ref> and very often floating scarves drawing from Chinese Buddhist art. They are not very common however; many appear in illustrations to biographical accounts of the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], which are themselves rare.

It also eats [[carrion]], berries, seaweed, and insects and other small invertebrates. Arctic foxes form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens. Occasionally, other family members may assist in raising their young. Natural predators of the Arctic fox are the red fox, golden eagles, wolverines, wolves, and grizzly bears.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Gallant|first1=Daniel|last2=et al.|title=Natal den selection by sympatric arctic and red foxes on Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada|journal=Polar Biology|date=2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=333\u2013345|doi=10.1007/s00300-013-1434-1}}</ref><ref name=\"doi.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Noren|first1=K|last2=et al.|title=From monogamy to complexity: social organization of arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) in contrasting ecosystems|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=2012|volume=90|issue=9|pages=1102\u20131116|url=https://doi.org/10.1139/z2012-077|doi=10.1139/z2012-077}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\nArctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to 90-100&nbsp;\u00b0C between the external environment and their internal core temperature.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal|last1=Fuglesteg|first1=Britt|last2=et al.|title=Seasonal variations in basal metabolic rate, lower critical temperature and responses to temporary starvation in the arctic fox ( A l o p e x l a g o p u s ) from Svalbard|journal=Polar Biology|date=2006|volume=29|issue=4|pages=308\u2013319|doi=10.1007/s00300-005-0054-9}}</ref> To prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail.

This provides greater insulation during the winter and a source of energy when food is scarce.<ref name=NOAA/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nIn the spring, the Arctic fox's attention switches to reproduction and a home for their potential offspring. They live in large dens in frost-free, slightly raised ground. These are complex systems of tunnels covering as much as {{convert|1000|m2|yd2|abbr=on}} and are often in [[esker]]s, long ridges of sedimentary material deposited in formerly [[Glacier|glaciated]] regions. These dens may be in existence for many decades and are used by many generations of foxes.<ref name=NOAA/>\n\n[[File:Fox pups animals.jpg|thumb|Pups of Arctic fox with summer morph]]\nArctic foxes tend to select dens that are easily accessible with many entrances, and that are clear from snow and ice making it easier to burrow in. The Arctic fox  builds and chooses dens that face southward towards the sun, which makes the den warmer. Arctic foxes prefer large, maze-like dens for predator evasion and a quick escape especially when red foxes are in the area. Natal dens are typically found in rugged terrain, which may provide more protection for the pups. But, the parents will also relocate litters to nearby dens to avoid predators. When red foxes are not in the region, Arctic foxes will use dens that the red fox previously occupied. Shelter quality is more important to the Arctic fox than the proximity of spring prey to a den.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe main prey in the tundra is lemmings, which is why the white fox is often called the \u201clemming fox.\u201d The white fox's reproduction rates reflect the lemming population density, which cyclically fluctuates every 3-5years.<ref name=\"dx.doi.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Pagh|first1=Sussie|last2=Hersteinsson|first2=Pall|title=Difference in diet and age structure of blue and white Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) in the Disko Bay area, West Greenland|journal=Polar Research|date=2008|volume=27|issue=1|pages=44\u201351|doi=10.1111/j.1751-8369.2008.00042.x|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.2008.00042.x|bibcode=2008PolRe..27...44P}}</ref><ref name=\"doi.org\"/> When lemmings are abundant, the white fox can give birth to 18 pups, but they often do not reproduce when food is scarce. The \u201ccoastal fox\u201d or blue fox lives in an environment where food availability is relatively consistent, and they will have up to 5 pups every year.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/>\n\nBreeding usually takes place in April and May, and the [[gestation period]] is about 52 days. Litters may contain as many as 25 (the largest litter size in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=David W.|title=Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-851556-1}}</ref> The young emerge from the den when 3 to 4 weeks old and are weaned by 9 weeks of age.<ref name=NOAA/>\n\nArctic foxes are primarily [[monogamous]] and both parents will care for the offspring. When predators and prey are abundant, Arctic foxes are more likely to be promiscuous (exhibited in both males and females) and display more complex social structures. Larger packs of foxes consisting of breeding or non-breeding males or females can guard a single territory more proficiently to increase pup survival. When resources are scarce, competition increases and the number of foxes in a territory decreases. On the coasts of Svalbard, the frequency of complex social structures is larger than inland foxes that remain monogamous due to food availability. In Scandinavia, there are more complex social structures compared to other populations due to the presence of the red fox. Also, conservationists are supplying the declining population with supplemental food. One unique case, however, is Iceland where monogamy is the most prevalent. The older offspring (1-year-olds) often remain within their parent's territory even though predators are absent and there are fewer resources, which may indicate [[kin selection]] in the fox.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/>\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Fox with fish.jpg|thumb|right|A Arctic fox (Summer morph) with fish]]\nArctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find, including [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, other rodents, [[hare]]s, [[bird]]s, [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, fish, and [[carrion]]. They scavenge on carcasses left by larger predators such as wolves and [[polar bear]]s, and in times of scarcity even eat their [[feces]]. In areas where they are present, lemmings are their most common prey,<ref name=NOAA/> and a family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. In some locations in northern Canada, a high seasonal abundance of migrating birds that breed in the area may provide an important food source. On the coast of Iceland and other islands, their diet consists predominantly of birds. During April and May, the Arctic fox also preys on [[ringed seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless. They also consume berries and seaweed, so they may be considered [[omnivore]]s.<ref name=\"Bockstoce2009\">{{cite book|author=Bockstoce, John R.|title=Furs and frontiers in the far north: the contest among native and foreign nations for the Bering Strait fur trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HY6LvFMSxxwC&pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14921-0|page=41|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101052246/http://books.google.com/books?id=HY6LvFMSxxwC&pg=PA41|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This fox is a significant bird-egg predator, consuming eggs of all except the largest tundra bird species.<ref name=truett>{{cite book|author1=Truett, Joe Clyde|author2=Johnson, Stephen R.|title=The natural history of an Arctic oil field: development and the biota|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELsq-yAP0XkC&pg=PA161|year=2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-701235-3|pages=160\u2013163|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224023628/https://books.google.com/books?id=ELsq-yAP0XkC&pg=PA161|archivedate=24 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When food is overabundant, the Arctic fox buries (caches) the surplus as a reserve.\n\nArctic foxes survive harsh winters and food scarcity by either hoarding food or storing body fat. Fat is deposited subcutaneously and viscerally in Arctic foxes. At the beginning of winter, the foxes have approximately 14740kJ of energy storage from fat alone. Using the lowest BMR value measured in Arctic foxes, an average sized fox (3.5&nbsp;kg) would need 471kJ/day during the winter to survive. Arctic foxes can acquire goose eggs (from greater snow geese in Canada) at a rate of 2.7-7.3eggs/h, and they store 80-97% of them. Scats provide evidence that they eat the eggs during the winter after caching. Isotope analysis shows that eggs can still be eaten after a year, and the metabolizable energy of a stored goose egg only decreases by 11% after 60 days (a fresh egg has about 816kJ). Researchers have also noted that some eggs stored in the summer are accessed later the following spring prior to reproduction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Careau|first1=V|last2=et al.|title=Surviving on cached foods \u2014 the energetics of egg-caching by arctic foxes|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=2008|volume=86|issue=10|pages=1217\u20131223|doi=10.1139/Z08-102}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[File:Alopex lagopus IMG 9019.JPG|thumb|left|Arctic fox sleeping with its tail wrapped around itself]]\nThe Arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet, but they do not start to shiver until the temperature drops to {{convert|-70|\u00b0C}}.

The Arctic fox decreases its BMR via metabolic depression in the winter to conserve fat storage and minimize energy requirements. According to the most recent data, the lower critical temperature of the Arctic fox is at -7&nbsp;\u00b0C in the winter and 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer. It was commonly believed that the Arctic fox had a lower critical temperature below -40&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, some scientists have concluded that this stat is not accurate since it was never tested using the proper equipment.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nAbout 22% of the total body surface area of the Arctic fox dissipates heat readily compared to red foxes at 33%. The regions that have the greatest heat loss are the nose, ears, legs, and feet, which is useful in the summer for thermal heat regulation. Also, the Arctic fox has a beneficial mechanism in their nose for evaporative cooling like dogs, which keeps the brain cool during the summer and exercise.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> The [[thermal conductivity]] of Arctic fox fur in the summer and winter is the same; however, the thermal conductance of the Arctic fox in the winter is lower than the summer since fur thickness increases by 140%. In the summer, the thermal conductance of the Arctic foxes body is 114% higher than the winter, but their body core temperature is constant year-round.\n\nOne way that Arctic foxes regulate their body temperature is by utilizing a countercurrent heat exchange in the blood of their legs.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Arctic foxes can constantly keep their feet above the tissue freezing point (-1&nbsp;\u00b0C) when standing on cold substrates without losing mobility or feeling pain. They do this by increasing vasodilation and blood flow to a capillary rete in the pad surface, which is in direct contact with the snow rather than the entire foot. They selectively vasoconstrict blood vessels in the center of the foot pad, which conserves energy and minimizes heat loss.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceG\">{{cite journal|last1=Henshaw|first1=Robert|last2=Underwood|first2=Larry|last3=Casey|first3=Timothy|title=Peripheral Thermoregulation: Foot Temperature in Two Arctic Canines|journal=Science|date=1972|volume=175|issue=4025|pages=988\u2013990|jstor=1732725|bibcode=1972Sci...175..988H|doi=10.1126/science.175.4025.988}}</ref> Arctic foxes maintain the temperature in their paws independently from the core temperature.

The Arctic fox and the red fox (''Vulpes vulpes'') diverged approximately 3.17MYA. Additionally, the Arctic fox diverged from its sister group, the kit fox (''Vulpes macrotis''), at about 0.9MYA.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Arctic fox have been described by the \u201cout of Tibet\u201d hypothesis. On the Tibetan Plateau, fossils of the extinct ancestral Arctic fox (''Vulpes giuzhudingi'') from the early Pliocene (5.08-3.6 MYA) were found along with many other precursors of modern mammals that evolved during the Pliocene (5.3-2.6 MYA). It is believed that this ancient fox is the ancestor of the modern Arctic fox. Globally, the Pliocene was about 2-3&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer than today, and the Arctic during the summer in the mid-Pliocene was 8&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer. By using stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of fossils, researchers claim that the Tibetan Plateau experienced tundra-like conditions during the Pliocene and harbored cold-adapted mammals that later spread to North America and Eurasia during the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million-11,700 years ago).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Xiaoming|last2=et al.|title=Cenozoic vertebrate evolution and paleoenvironment in Tibetan Plateau: Progress and prospects|journal=Gondwana Research|date=2015|volume=27|issue=4|pages=1335\u20131354|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.014|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.014|bibcode=2015GondR..27.1335W}}</ref>\n\n===Subspecies===\n[[File:Blue fox on St Paul Island by Ryan Mong USFWS.jpg|thumb|Blue phase, Pribilof Islands]] \nBesides the nominate [[subspecies]], ''V. l. lagopus'', four other subspecies of this fox are described:\n* [[Bering Sea#Islands|Bering]] Islands Arctic fox, ''V. l. beringensis''\n* Iceland Arctic fox, ''V. l. fuliginosus''\n* [[Pribilof Islands]] Arctic fox, ''V. l. pribilofensis''\n* Greenland Arctic fox, ''V. l. foragorapusis''\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[Image:ArcticFoxesLyd.jpg|thumb|The Arctic fox's seasonal furs, summer (top), \"blue\" (middle), and winter (bottom)]]\n\nThe Arctic fox has a circumpolar distribution and occurs in Arctic tundra habitats in northern Europe, northern Asia, and North America.

Commuting trips in Arctic foxes last less than 3 days and occur between 0-2.9 times a month.  Nomadism is found in 3.4% of the foxes, and loop migrations (where the fox travels to a new range, then returns to its home range) are the least common at 1.1%. Arctic foxes in Canada that undergo nomadism and migrations voyage from the Canadian archipelago to Greenland and northwestern Canada. The duration and distance traveled between males and females is not significantly different.\n\nArctic foxes closer to goose colonies (located at the coasts) are less likely to migrate. Meanwhile, foxes experiencing low-density lemming populations are more likely to make sea ice trips. Residency is common in the Arctic fox population so that they can maintain their territories. Migratory foxes have a mortality rate >3 times higher than resident foxes. Nomadic behavior becomes more common as the foxes age.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Conservation status==\n[[File:Lagopusskull.jpg|thumb|left|Skull]]\n\nThe conservation status of the species is in general good and several hundred thousand individuals are estimated to remain in total.

It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of [[folklore]] is sometimes called folkloristics. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and [[mythology]].\n\n'''American folklore''' encompasses the [[folk tradition]]s that have evolved on the North American continent since Europeans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people.\n\n==Native American folklore==\n[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures are rich in myths and legends that explain natural phenomena and the relationship between humans and the spirit world. According to Barre Toelken, feathers, beadwork, dance steps and music, the events in a story, the shape of a dwelling, or items of traditional food can be viewed as icons of cultural meaning.<ref name=Barre>[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=usupress_pubs Toelken, Barre. ''The Anguish of Snails'', Utah State University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|0-87421-555-2}}</ref>\n\nNative American cultures are numerous and diverse. Though some neighboring cultures hold similar beliefs, others can be quite different from one another. The most common myths are the creation myths, that tell a story to explain how the earth was formed, and where humans and other beings came from. Others may include explanations about the sun, moon, constellations, specific animals, seasons, and weather. This is one of the ways that many tribes have kept, and continue to keep, their cultures alive; these stories are not told simply for entertainment, but as a way of preserving and transmitting the nation, tribe or band's particular beliefs, history, customs, spirituality and traditional way of life. \"[S]tories not only entertain but also embody Native behavioral and ethical values.\"<ref name=Barre/>\n\nThere are many different kinds of stories. Some are called \"hero stories\"; these are stories of people who lived at one time, and who were immortalized and remembered through these tales. There are \"trickster stories\", about the different trickster figures of the tribes, spirits who may be either helpful or dangerous, depending on the situation. There are also tales that are simply warnings; they warn against doing something that may harm in some way. Many of these tales have morals or some form of belief that is being taught. This is how the things were remembered.\n\n==Founding myths==\nThe founding of the United States is often surrounded by legends and tall tales. Many stories have developed since the founding long ago to become a part of America's folklore and cultural awareness, and non-Native American folklore especially includes any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and belief systems. These narratives may be true and may be false or may be a little true and a little false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor.\n\n===Christopher Columbus===\n[[Christopher Columbus]], as a hero and symbol to the then immigrants, is an important figure in the pantheon of American myth. His status, not unlike most American icons, is representative not of his own accomplishments, but the self-perception of the society which chose him as a hero. Having effected a separation from England and its cultural icons, America was left without history\u2014or heroes on which to base a shared sense of their social selves. [[Washington Irving]] was instrumental in popularizing Columbus. His version of Columbus' life, published in 1829, was more a romance than a biography. The book was very popular, and contributed to an image of the discoverer as a solitary individual who challenged the unknown sea, as triumphant Americans contemplated the dangers and promise of their own wilderness [[frontier]]. As a consequence of his vision and audacity, there was now a land free from kings, a vast continent for new beginnings. In the years following the Revolution the poetic device \"Columbia\" was used as a symbol of both Columbus and America. King's College of New York changed its name in 1792 to Columbia, and the new capitol in Washington was subtitled District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/COLUMBUS/col3.html |title='&#39;Columbus in History'&#39; |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>\n\n===Jamestown===\n{{Main article|Pocahontas}}\nIn May 1607, the Susan Constant, the Discovery, and the Godspeed sailed through Chesapeake Bay and thirty miles up the James River settlers built [[Jamestown, Virginia]], England's first permanent colony. Too late in the season to plant crops, many were not accustomed to manual labor. Within a few months, some settlers died of famine and disease. Only thirty-eight made it through their first year in the New World. [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]], a pirate turned gentleman turned the settlers into foragers and successful traders with the Native Americans, who taught the English how to plant corn and other crops. Smith led expeditions to explore the regions surrounding Jamestown, and it was during one of these that the chief of the Powhatan Native Americans captured Smith. According to an account Smith published in 1624, he was going to be put to death until the chief's daughter, [[Pocahontas]], saved him. From this the legend of Pocahontas sprang forth, becoming part of American folklore, children's books, and movies.<ref>{{cite web|last=McGeehan |first=John R. |url=http://www.netplaces.com/american-history/english-french-and-dutch-influences/jamestown-settlement.htm |title=McGeehan, John R., '&#39;Jamestown Settlement |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>\n\n===Pilgrims===\n[[File:Plymouth Rock Monument cropped.JPG|right|thumb|Plymouth Rock Monument designed for the Tercentenary (1920)]]\n[[Plymouth Rock]] is the traditional site of disembarkation of [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] and the [[Mayflower]] Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620, and an important symbol in American history. There are no contemporary references to the Pilgrims' landing on a rock at Plymouth. The first written reference to the Pilgrims landing on a rock is found 121&nbsp;years after they landed. The Rock, or one traditionally identified as it, has long been memorialized on the shore of Plymouth Harbor in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is said to have begun with the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] in 1621.<ref>{{cite web|author=Aspen Design, Westbrook, CT |url=http://www.pilgrimhall.org/f_thanks.htm |title=Pilgrim Hall Museum |publisher=Pilgrimhall.org |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184539/http://pilgrimhall.org/f_thanks.htm |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}</ref> They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death. Some friendly Native Americans (including [[Squanto]]) helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter. The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival.\n\n==Revolutionary War figures==\n{{See also|Freedom Trail}}\n\n===George Washington===\n[[George Washington]] (February 22, 1732 \u2013 December 14, 1799), the country's first president, is often said to be the father of his country. Apocryphal stories about Washington's childhood include a claim that he skipped a silver dollar across the [[Rappahannock River]] at [[Ferry Farm]]. Another tale claims that as a young child, Washington chopped down his father's cherry tree. His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed \"I can not tell a lie\" and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty. Parson [[Mason Locke Weems]] mentions the first citation of this legend in his 1806 book, ''The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen''. This anecdote cannot be independently verified. [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) is also known to have spread the story while lecturing, personalizing it by adding \"I have a higher and greater standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie but I won't.\"\n\n===Patrick Henry===\n[[Patrick Henry]] (May 29, 1736 \u2013 June 6, 1799) was an attorney, planter and politician who became known as an orator during the movement for independence in Virginia in the 1770s. Patrick Henry is best known for the speech he made in the House of Burgesses on March 23, 1775, in Saint John's Church in Richmond, Virginia. With the House undecided on whether to mobilize for military action against the encroaching British military force, Henry argued in favor of mobilization. Forty-two years later, Henry's first biographer, William Wirt, working from oral histories, tried to reconstruct what Henry said. According to Wirt, Henry ended his speech with words that have since become immortalized: \"I know not what course others may take; but as for me, Give me Liberty, or give me Death!\" The crowd, by Wirt's account, jumped up and shouted \"To Arms! To Arms!\". For 160&nbsp;years Wirt's account was taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to question the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction.\n\n[[File:Betsy Ross sewing.jpg|thumb|Betsy Ross sewing]]\n\n===Betsy Ross===\n[[Betsy Ross]] (January 1, 1752 \u2013 January 30, 1836) is widely credited with making the first American flag. There is, however, no credible historical evidence that the story is true. Research conducted by the National Museum of American History notes that the story of Betsy Ross making the first American flag for General George Washington entered into American consciousness about the time of the 1876 centennial celebrations. In the 2008 book ''The Star-Spangled Banner: The Making of an American Icon'', Smithsonian experts point out that accounts of the event appealed to Americans eager for stories about the revolution and its heroes and heroines. Betsy Ross was promoted as a patriotic role model for young girls and a symbol of women's contributions to American history.\n\nOther Revolutionary War heroes who became figures of American folklore include: [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Nathan Hale]], [[John Hancock]], [[John Paul Jones]] and [[Francis Marion]].\n\n==Tall Tales==\nThe [[tall tale]] is a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when men of the [[American frontier]] gathered. A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the American Old West, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.\n\n===Based on historical figures===\n\n*[[Johnny Appleseed|John Chapman]] (September 26, 1774 \u2013 March 18, 1845), widely known as Johnny Appleseed, was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. He became an American legend while still alive, largely because of his kind and generous ways, and the symbolic importance he attributed to apples. Johnny Appleseed is remembered in American popular culture by his traveling song or Swedenborgian hymn (\"The Lord is good to me...\").\n*[[Daniel Boone]] (November 2, 1734 [O.S. October 22] \u2013 September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States.\n*[[David Crockett|\"Davy\" Crockett]] (August 17, 1786 \u2013 March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet, \"King of the Wild Frontier\". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives, served in the Texas Revolution, and died at the Battle of the Alamo.\n*[[Mike Fink]] (c. 1770/1780 \u2013 c. 1823) called \"king of the keelboaters\", was a semi-legendary brawler and river boatman who exemplified the tough and hard-drinking men who ran keelboats up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.\n*Martha Jane Canary (May 1, 1852 \u2013 August 1, 1903), better known as [[Calamity Jane]], was an American frontierswoman, and professional scout best known for her claim of being an acquaintance of [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. She is said to have also exhibited kindness and compassion, especially to the sick and needy. It was from her that [[Bret Harte]] took his famous character of Cherokee Sal in ''The Luck of Roaring Camp''.\n*[[Jigger Johnson]] (1871-1935), was a [[lumberjack]] and [[log driving|log driver]] from northern [[New England]] who is known for his numerous off-the-job exploits, such as catching [[bobcats]] alive with his bare hands, and drunken brawls.<ref>''Appalachia'' Appalachian Mountain Club, 1964.</ref><ref>Monahan, Robert. \"Jigger Johnson\", ''New Hampshire Profiles magazine'', Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957.</ref> \n*[[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] was an African-American railroad worker who is said to have worked as a \"steel-driving man\"\u2014a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock away in constructing a railroad tunnel. According to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a steam powered hammer, which he won, only to die in victory with his hammer in his hand and his heart giving out from stress. The \"Ballad of John Henry\" is a musical rendition of his story.\n\nOther historical figures include Titanic survivor [[Margaret Brown|Molly Brown]], Wild West showman [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]], and sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]].\n\n===Fictional characters===\n\n*[[Paul Bunyan]] is a lumberjack figure in North American folklore and tradition. One of the most famous and popular North American folklore heroes, he is usually described as a giant as well as a lumberjack of unusual skill, and is often accompanied in stories by his animal companion, [[Babe the Blue Ox]]. The character originated in folktales circulated among lumberjacks in the Northeastern United States and eastern Canada, first appearing in print in a story published by Northern Michigan journalist James MacGillivray in 1906.\n*The [[Lone Ranger]] is a fictional hero of the west who fought raiders and robbers in the Texas area. The sole survivor of a group of six rangers, he set out to bring the criminals who killed his brother to justice.\n*[[John the Conqueror]] also known as High John the Conqueror, and many other folk variants, is a folk hero from African-American folklore. John the Conqueror was an African prince who was sold as a slave in the Americas. Despite his enslavement, his spirit was never broken and he survived in folklore as a sort of a trickster figure, because of the tricks he played to evade his masters. Joel Chandler Harris's 'Br'er Rabbit' of the Uncle Remus stories is said to be patterned after High John the Conqueror.\n*[[Pecos Bill]] is an American cowboy, apocryphally immortalized in numerous tall tales of the Old West during American westward expansion into the Southwest of Texas, New Mexico, Southern California, and Arizona\n[[File:MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917).jpg|thumb|upright|MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917)]]\n\n*[[Molly Pitcher]] was a nickname given to a woman said to have fought in the American Battle of Monmouth, who is generally believed to have been Mary Ludwig Hays McCauly. Since various Molly Pitcher tales grew in the telling, many historians regard Molly Pitcher as folklore rather than history, or suggest that Molly Pitcher may be a composite image inspired by the actions of a number of real women. The name itself may have originated as a nickname given to women who carried water to men on the battlefield during the war.\n*[[Captain Stormalong]] was an American folk hero and the subject of numerous nautical-themed tall tales originating in Massachusetts. Stormalong was said to be a sailor and a giant, some 30&nbsp;feet tall; he was the master of a huge clipper ship known in various sources as either the Courser or the Tuscarora, a ship so tall that it had hinged masts to avoid catching on the moon.\n\n==Legendary and folkloric creatures==\n\n*[[Bigfoot]], also known as \"Sasquatch\", is the name given to an ape-like creature that some believe inhabit mostly forests in the Pacific Northwest region of, and throughout the entirety of, North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. Generally, scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot due to the impact that it would have on the currently assumed evolutionary lineage of humans, that Homo Sapien is the last remaining species of Hominid. There are more than 100 sightings that are reported yearly.\n*[[Champ (cryptozoology)|Champ]] is the name given to a reputed lake monster living in Lake Champlain, a natural freshwater lake in North America. The lake crosses the U.S./Canada border; located partially in the Canadian province of Quebec and partially in the U.S. states of Vermont and New York. There is no scientific evidence for Champ's existence, though there have been over 300 reported sightings.\n*[[Jersey Devil|The Jersey Devil]] is a legendary creature said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey in the United States. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many different variations. The most common description is that of a kangaroo-like creature with the face of a horse, the head of a dog, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly as to avoid human contact, and often is described as emitting a \"blood-curdling scream\".\n*[[White Lady (ghost)|The White Lady]] is a type of female ghost reportedly seen in rural areas and associated with some local legend of tragedy. Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fianc\u00e9. They are often associated with an individual family line or said to be a harbinger of death, similar to a [[banshee]].\n*[[Mothman]] is a mythical half moth half man from Point Pleasant, West Virginia described as a large humanoid with moth features on its face and large wings with fur covering its body. Mothman has been blamed for the collapse of the Silver Bridge.\n*[[Hodag]] The Hodag is mythical beast that is said to inhabit the forests of Northern Wisconsin, particularly around the city of Rhinelander. The Hodag has a reptilian body with the horns of a bull, and is said to have a penchant for mischief.\n\nOther folkloric creatures include the fearsome [[Jackalope]], the [[Nain Rouge]] of Detroit, Michigan, [[Wendigo]] of Minnesota and [[Chessie (sea monster)|Chessie]], a legendary sea monster said to live in Chesapeake Bay.\n\n==Literature==\n[[Santa Claus]], also known as Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, or simply \"Santa\", is a figure with legendary, mythical, historical and folkloric origins. The modern figure of Santa Claus was derived from the Dutch figure, Sinterklaas, which may, in turn, have its origins in the hagiographical tales concerning the Christian Saint Nicholas. \"[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]\", also known as \"The Night Before Christmas\" is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore. The poem, which has been called \"arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American\",<ref name=gotham>[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] & [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Wallace, Mike]]. ''[[Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898]]''.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 462-463 {{ISBN|0-19-511634-8}}</ref> is largely responsible for the conception of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today, including his physical appearance, the night of his visit, his mode of transportation, the number and names of his reindeer, as well as the tradition that he brings toys to children. The poem has influenced ideas about St. Nicholas and Santa Claus from the United States to the rest of the English-speaking world and beyond. ''Is There a Santa Claus?'' was the title of an editorial appearing in the September 21, 1897, edition of The (New York) Sun. The editorial, which included the famous reply \"[[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus]]\", has become a part of popular Christmas folklore in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]] is a fictional character from the short story \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by American author Washington Irving. The story, from Irving's collection of short stories entitled The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film.\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a children's novel written by [[L. Frank Baum]] and illustrated by W. W. Denslow. Originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900, it has since been reprinted numerous times, most often under the name The Wizard of Oz, which is the name of both the 1902 stage play and the well-known adaptation 1939 film version, starring Judy Garland. The story chronicles the adventures of a young girl named Dorothy Gale in the Land of Oz, after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a tornado. Thanks in part to the 1939 MGM movie, it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture.\n\n==Folk music==\n{{Main article|American folk music}}\nNative Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributes to a melting pot. Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that.\n\nEarliest American scholars were with The American Folklore Society (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include Native American music, but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies. In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Library of Congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors Robert Winslow Gordon, Alan Lomax and others to capture as much North American field material as possible. Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nThe [[American folk music revival]] was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like [[Burl Ives]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Oscar Brand]] had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward musical styles that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country & western, jazz, and rock and roll music.\n\n===African-American music===\nSlavery was introduced to the British colonies in the early 17th century. The ancestors of today's African-American population were brought from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, and brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complex rhythmic music, as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans \"retain continuity with their past through music\". The first slaves in the United States sang work songs, and field hollers.\n\n====African American Spirituals====\nProtestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns, they were called [[Negro spirituals]]. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs and field hollers, that blues, jazz and gospel developed. Negro spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith.\n\n===Folk songs===\nThe Thirteen Colonies of the original United States were all former British possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks and murder.\n\nFolk songs may be classified by subject matter, such as: [[drinking songs]], [[sporting song]]s, train songs, [[work song]]s, [[war songs]], and [[ballad]]s.\n\n*[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'s tune was adapted from an old English drinking song by John Stafford Smith called \"To Anacreon in Heaven\"\n*\"[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]\" is a traditional song about railroad engineer Casey Jones and his death at the controls of the train he was driving. It tells of how Jones and his fireman Sim Webb raced their locomotive to make up for lost time, but discovered another train ahead of them on the line, and how Jones remained on board to try to stop the train as Webb jumped to safety.\n*\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" (sometimes \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\") is a popular song of the American Civil War that expressed people's longing for the return of their friends and relatives who were fighting in the war. The Irish anti-war song \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" and \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" share the same melodic material. Based on internal textual references, \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" apparently dates from the early 1820s, while When Johnny Comes Marching Home was first published in 1863. \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" is a popular traditional Irish anti-war and anti-recruiting song. It is generally dated to the early 19th century, when soldiers from Athy, County Kildare served the British East India Company.\n*\"Oh My Darling, Clementine\" (1884) is an American western folk ballad believed to have been based on another song called Down by the River Liv'd a Maiden (1863). The words are those of a bereaved lover singing about his darling, the daughter of a miner in the 1849 California Gold Rush. He loses her in a drowning accident. The song plays during the opening credits for the highly acclaimed [[John Ford]] movie \"[[My Darling Clementine]]\". It also runs as a background score all through the movie.\n*[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]  is a traditional folk song. The original love song has become associated with the legend that Emily D. West, a biracial indentured servant, \"helped win the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle in the Texas Revolution\".\n*\"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]\" is a 1908 Tin Pan Alley song by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer which has become the unofficial anthem of baseball, although neither of its authors had attended a game prior to writing the song. The song is traditionally sung during the seventh-inning stretch of a baseball game. Fans are generally encouraged to sing along.\n\nOther American folksongs include: \"[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]\", \"[[Skewball]]\", \"[[Big Bad John]]\", \"[[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]]\", \"[[Camptown Races]]\" and \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\".\n\n===Sea shanties===\n{{Main article|Sea shanty}}\nWork songs sung by sailors between the 18th and 20th centuries are known as sea shanties. The shanty was a distinct type of work song, developed especially in American-style merchant vessels that had come to prominence in decades prior to the American Civil War. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a call-and-answer format. Well before the 19th century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together.\n\nThey were notably influenced by songs of African Americans, such as those sung whilst manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the southern United States. The work contexts in which African-Americans sang songs comparable to shanties included: boat-rowing on rivers of the south-eastern U.S. and Caribbean; the work of stokers or \"firemen\", who cast wood into the furnaces of steamboats plying great American rivers;and stevedoring on the U.S. eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean\u2014including \"cotton-screwing\": the loading of ships with cotton in ports of the American South. During the first half of the 19th century, some of the songs African Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.\n\nShanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.\n\n*\"Poor Paddy Works on the Railway\" is a popular Irish and American folk song. Historically, it was often sung as a sea chanty. The song portrays an Irish worker working on a railroad. There are numerous titles of the song including, \"Pat Works on the Railway\" and \"Paddy on the Railway\". \"Paddy Works on the Erie\" is another version of the song. \"Paddy on the Railway\" is attested as a chanty in the earliest known published work to use the word \"chanty\", G. E. Clark's ''Seven Years of a Sailor's Life'' (1867). Clark recounted experiences fishing on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, in a vessel out of Provincetown, Mass. ca. 1865-6. At one point, the crew is getting up the anchor in a storm, by means of a pump-style windlass. One of the chanties the men sing while performing this task is mentioned by title, \"Paddy on the Railway\".\n\n===Shaker music===\n{{Shaker music}}\nThe [[Shakers]] is a religious sect founded in 18th-century England upon the teachings of [[Ann Lee]]. Shakers today are most known for their cultural contributions (especially style of music and furniture). The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and also created many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. In Shaker society, a [[Era of Manifestations|spiritual \"gift\"]] could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it important to record musical inspirations as they occurred. \"[[Simple Gifts]]\" was composed by Elder [[Joseph Brackett]] and originated in the [[Alfred Shaker Historic District|Alfred Shaker community]] in Maine in 1848. [[Aaron Copland]]'s iconic 1944 ballet score [[Appalachian Spring]], uses the now famous Shaker tune \"Simple Gifts\" as the basis of its finale.\n\n==Folk dancing==\nFolk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style.\n\n==Locations and landmarks==\n*the \"Lost Colony\" of Roanoke Island: In 1587, Sir Walter Raleigh recruited over 100 men, women and children to journey from England to Roanoke Island on North Carolina's coast and establish the first English settlement in America under the direction of John White as governor. [[Virginia Dare]] (born August 18, 1587) was the first child born in the Americas to English parents, Ananias and Eleanor White Dare in the short-lived Roanoke Colony. The fact of her birth is known because the governor of the settlement, Virginia Dare's grandfather, John White, returned to England in 1587 to seek fresh supplies. When White eventually returned three years later, Virginia and the other colonists were gone. During the past four hundred years, Virginia Dare has become a prominent figure in American myth and folklore, symbolizing different things to different groups of people. She is the subject of a poem (''Peregrine White and Virginia Dare'') by Rosemary and [[Stephen Vincent Benet]], and the North Carolina ''Legend of the White Doe''. While often cited as an Indian legend, the white doe seems to have its roots in English folklore. White deer are common in English legends and often used as symbols of Christian virtue. A similar story of a young girl transformed into a white deer can be found in Yorkshire, where it formed the basis for Wordsworth's poem ''[[The White Doe of Rylstone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinaghosts.com/coast/virginia-dare-white-doe.php |title='&#39;Legend of the White Doe'&#39; |publisher=Northcarolinaghosts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref> In the four centuries since their disappearance, the Roanoke colonists have been the subject of a mystery that still challenges historians and archaeologists as one of America's oldest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalguide.com/packet/lostcolony-croatan.shtml |title=Hause, Eric '&#39;The Lost Colony'&#39; |publisher=Coastalguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>\n*[[Times Square]] is a major commercial intersection in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue and stretching from West 42nd to West 47th Streets. Times Square \u2013 iconified as \"The Crossroads of the World\" is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway [[Theater District]]. Formerly Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in April 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to the newly erected Times Building site of the annual ball drop on New Year's Eve. The northern triangle of Times Square is technically Duffy Square, dedicated in 1937 to Chaplain Francis P. Duffy of New York City's \"Fighting 69th\" Infantry Regiment; a memorial to Duffy is located there, along with a statue of George M. Cohan. The Duffy Statue and the square were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.\n[[File:Empirestatebuildingfrombrooklynnewyork.jpg|thumb|upright|The Empire State Building]]\n\n*[[Empire State Building]] is a 102-story skyscraper located in New York City at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street. Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. It stood as the world's tallest building for 40&nbsp;years, from its completion in 1931. The Empire State Building is generally thought of as an American cultural icon. The project involved 3,400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with hundreds of Mohawk iron workers, many from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. Perhaps the most famous popular culture representation of the building is in the 1933 film King Kong, in which the title character, a giant ape, climbs to the top to escape his captors but falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The 1957 romantic drama film An Affair to Remember involves a couple who plan to meet atop the Empire State Building, a rendezvous that is averted by an automobile accident. The 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy partially inspired by An Affair to Remember, climaxes with a scene at the Empire State observatory.\n\nOther locations and landmarks that have become part of American folklore include: [[Independence Hall]], [[Monument Valley]], [[Ellis Island]], [[Hoover Dam]], [[Pearl Harbor]], the [[Vietnam War Memorial]], and the [[Grand Canyon]].\n\n==Cultural icons==\n\n*The [[Liberty Bell]] is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The bell was commissioned from the London firm of Lester and Pack in 1752, and was cast with the lettering (part of Leviticus 25:10) \"Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.\" In the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies, who dubbed it the \"Liberty Bell\". It acquired its distinctive large crack sometime in the early 19th century\u2014a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835.\n*[[Statue of Liberty]] The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, designed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tablet upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.\n*[[Uncle Sam]] (initials U.S.) is a common national personification of the American government and came into use during the War of 1812. According to legend, Samuel Wilson, a meat packer in New York, supplied rations for the soldiers and stamped the letters U.S. on the boxes, which stood for United States but was jokingly said to be the initials of Uncle Sam. An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775, in the original \"Yankee Doodle\" lyrics of the Revolutionary War {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. The earliest known personification of what would become the United States was \"[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]\", who first appeared in 1738 and sometimes was associated with liberty. With the American Revolutionary War came \"Brother Jonathan\" as another personification and finally after the War of 1812 Uncle Sam appeared.\n\nOther Cultural Icons include, [[Rosie the Riveter]], the [[United States Constitution]], the [[Colt Single Action Army]], [[Smokey Bear]], the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] and [[Apple Pie]].\n\n==History==\nHistorical events that form a part of American folklore include: [[9/11]], [[Boston Massacre]], [[Boston Tea Party]], [[Paul Revere#The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere|Paul Revere's Ride]], the [[Battle of the Alamo]], the [[Salem witch trials]], [[Gunfight at the O.K.

Set in a [[science fiction]] depiction of the [[22nd century in fiction#Other video games|22nd century]], the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron (\"Planet\") in the [[Alpha Centauri]] [[star system]]. As the game progresses, Planet's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists.\n\n[[Sid Meier]], designer of ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'', and [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]], designer of ''[[Civilization II]]'', developed ''Alpha Centauri'' after they left [[MicroProse]] to join the newly created [[Video game developer|developer]] [[Firaxis Games]]. [[Electronic Arts]] released both ''Alpha Centauri'' and its expansion, ''Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire'', in 1999. The following year, [[Aspyr Media]] [[Porting|ported]] both titles to [[Classic Mac OS]] while [[Loki Software]] ported them to [[Linux]].\n\n''Alpha Centauri'' features improvements on ''Civilization II''{{'}}s [[game engine]], including simultaneous multiplay, social engineering, climate, customizable units, alien native life, additional diplomatic and spy options, additional ways to win, and greater [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]-ability. ''Alien Crossfire'' introduces five new human and two non-human factions, as well as additional technologies, facilities, secret projects, native life, unit abilities, and a victory condition.\n\nThe game received wide critical acclaim, being compared favorably to ''Civilization II''. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Frank Herbert]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and [[Isaac Asimov]]), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, and the depth of the [[technology tree]]. ''Alpha Centauri'' also won several awards for best game of the year and best strategy game of the year.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\nSpace-race victories in the ''Civilization'' series conclude with a journey to [[Alpha Centauri]].<ref name=Shah2000p1>[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.1.</ref> Beginning with that premise the ''Alpha Centauri'' narrative starts in the [[22nd century#Video games|22nd century]], after the [[United Nations]] sends \"Unity\", a colonization mission, to Alpha Centauri's planet Chiron (\"Planet\").<ref name=SMACManual1999p2>[[#SMACManual|Reynolds (1999)]], p.2.</ref> Unbeknownst to humans, advanced extraterrestrials (\"Progenitors\") had been conducting experiments in vast distributed nervous systems, culminating in planetary biosphere-sized presentient nervous system (\"Manifold\") on Chiron, leaving behind monoliths and artifacts on Planet to guide and examine the system's growth.<ref name=Shah2000p3>[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.3.</ref> Immediately prior to the start of the game, a reactor malfunction on the Unity spacecraft wakes the crew and colonists early and irreparably severs communications with Earth.<ref name=SMACManual1999p3>[[#SMACManual|Reynolds (1999)]], p.3.</ref> After the captain is assassinated, the most powerful leaders on board build ideological factions with dedicated followers, conflicting agendas for the future of mankind, and \"desperately serious\" commitments.<ref name=\"SMACManual1999p3\"/><ref name=Rosen1999>[[#Rosen1999|Rosen (1999)]]</ref> As the ship breaks up, seven escape pods, each containing a faction, are scattered across Planet.<ref name=Tito2005p1>[[#Tito2005|Tito (2005)]], p.1.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Alien Crossfire'' expansion pack, it is learned that earlier alien experiments had led to disastrous consequences at [[Tau Ceti]], creating a hundred-million-year evolutionary cycle that ended with the eradication of most complex animal life in several neighbouring inhabited star systems.<ref name=Primap286>[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.286.</ref> After the disaster (referred to by Progenitors as \"Tau Ceti Flowering\"), the Progenitors split into two factions: Manifold Caretakers, opposed to further experimentation and dedicated to preventing another Flowering; and Manifold Usurpers, favoring further experimentation and intending to induce a controlled Flowering in ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s Planet.

Many game features from ''[[Civilization II]]'' are present, but renamed or slightly tweaked: players establish bases (Civilization II's cities), build facilities (buildings) and secret projects (Wonders of the World), explore territory, research technology, and conquer other factions (civilizations).<ref name=\"Shah2000p1\"/><ref name=Tito2005p1/><ref>{{cite news|last=Noer |first=Michael |url=https://www.forbes.com/1997/07/25/sid.html |title=Sid starts up.

Through [[Terraforming in popular culture|terraforming]], players may modify the effects of the individual map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and facilities, and supply energy. Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike ''Civilization II'', new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift.<ref name=Edge2006p1/><ref name=Primap230>[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.230.</ref> Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain facilities, and attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction.\n\nIn addition to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties forced by the player's choice of faction.<ref name=Tito2005p1/><ref name=Edge2006p1/><ref name=Shah2000p2/><ref name=DD898p2/><ref name=DD898p1>[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p1.</ref> Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions.

As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, logical, and detailed picture of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy.<ref name=DD698p1/> Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into ''Alpha Centauri'' as external \"natural forces\" intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences.<ref name=SMACManual1999p238/> Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action. Another concern was that Planet matched the story, which resulted in the fungus being connected across continents, as it is supposed to be a gigantic neural network.<ref name=Prima70>[[#Prima|Pine (1999)]], p.70.</ref>\n\n[[Terraforming]] is a natural outgrowth of colonizing an alien world.<ref name=DD698p2>[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p2.</ref> The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game.<ref name=Harrison2000/> This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.<ref name=DD698p2/>\n\nIn addition to scientific advances, the designers speculated on the future development of human society.<ref name=DD698p3>[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p3.</ref> The designers allow the player to decide on a whole series of value choices and choose a \"ruthless\", \"moderate\", or \"idealistic\" stance. Reynolds said the designers don't promote a single \"right\" answer, instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences. This design was intended to force the player to \"think\" and make the game \"addictive\".<ref name=DD698p3/> He also commented that ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s fictional nature allowed them to draw their characters \"a lot more sharply and distinctly than the natural blurring and greyness of history\".<ref name=Harrison2000/>\n[[Chiron]], the name of the planet, is the name of the only non-barbaric [[centaur]] in Greek mythology and an important loregiver and teacher for humanity. The name also pays homage to [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan's]] 1982 [[space opera]] novel ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'', in which a human colony is artificially planted by an automatic probe on a planet later named by colonists as Chiron. In the game, Chiron has two moons, named after the centaurs [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]] and [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]], with the combined tidal force of [[Moon|Earth's Moon]], and is the second planet out from Alpha Centauri A, the innermost planet being the [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]-like planet named after the centaur [[Eurytion]]. Alpha Centauri B is also dubbed [[Hercules]], a reference to him killing several centaurs in mythology, and the second star preventing the formation of larger planets. The arrival on Chiron is referred to as \"Planetfall\", which is a term used in many science fiction novels, including [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''Future History'' series, and [[Infocom]]'s celebrated comic [[interactive fiction]] adventure ''[[Planetfall]]''. [[Vernor Vinge]]'s concept of ''technological singularity'' is the origin of the Transcendence concept. The game's cutscenes use montages of live-action video, CGI, or both; most of the former is from the 1992 experimental documentary ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]''.\n\n===''Alpha Centauri''===\nIn July 1996, Firaxis began work on ''Alpha Centauri'',<ref name=\"B\">{{cite web|title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri|url=http://www.firaxis.com/games/game_detail.php?gameid=7|work=Firaxis Games|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126164929/http://www.firaxis.com/games/game_detail.php?gameid=7|archivedate=2013-01-26|df=}}</ref><ref name=SMACManual1999p236>[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.236.</ref> with Reynolds heading the project.<ref name=Harrison2000/> Meier and Reynolds wrote playable prototype code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development [[Library (computing)|libraries]].<ref name=Harrison2000/><ref name=SMACManual1999p236/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/075/075802p1.html| title = Brian Reynolds Launches New Development Studio| publisher = IGN| date = 2000-02-28| accessdate = 2010-09-05}}</ref> Because the development of ''Gettysburg'' took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas.<ref name=SMACManual1999p238/> By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and by the middle of the next year, they were working on a multiplayer [[Game engine|engine]].<ref name=SMACManual1999p238/> Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way.

The first attack was the assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April 1995. This year marked the escape of 20-year-old Khadaffy Janjalani from [[Camp Crame]] in [[Manila]] along with another member named Jovenal Bruno. On 18 December, 1998, Abdurajik was killed in a gun battle with the [[Philippine National Police]] on Basilan Island.<ref name=\"TimeAsiaReturn\" /> He is thought to have been about 39.<ref name=\"BBCWho\" /> \n\nThe death of Aburajik marked a turning point in Abu Sayyaf operations. The group shifted to kidnappings, murders and robberies, under younger brother Khadaffy. Basilan, Jolo and Sulu experienced some of the fiercest fights between government troops and Abu Sayyaf through the early 1990s. Abu Sayyaf primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members traveling to [[Manila]] and other provinces. It was reported that Abu Sayyaf began expanding into neighboring [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] by the early 1990s. Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest, but strongest of the Philippine [[Islamist]] separatist groups. Some Abu Sayyaf members studied or worked in [[Saudi Arabia]] and developed ties to [[mujahadeen]], while fighting and training in the war against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"PacCom\" /> Abu Sayyaf proclaimed themselves to be [[mujahideen]] and freedom fighters.\n\n===Khadaffy Janjalani leadership (1999\u20132007)===\nUntil his death in a gun battle on 4 September, 2006, [[Khadaffy Janjalani|Khaddafy Janjalani]] was considered the nominal leader of the group by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

After his leadership was secured, Abu Sayyaf began a new strategy, taking hostages. The group's motive for kidnapping became more financial than religious during this period, according to locals.

He is also credited by some with the creation of the [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet]]. In ''The Anabasis'', Xenophon describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the [[Persian people|Persians]].<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Xenophon]]|title=[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]|pages=IV.v.2\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Early contacts===\nW.

However, unlike shared innovations (or ''[[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]''), the common retention of archaisms (or ''[[symplesiomorphy]]'') is not considered conclusive evidence of a period of common isolated development.\n\nIn 1985, Soviet linguist [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] noted the presence in [[Classical Armenian]] of what he calls a \"Caucasian substratum\" identified by earlier scholars, consisting of loans from the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages]].<ref name=Diakonoff1985>{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/Hurro-urartianBorrowingsInOldArmenian#page/n1/mode/1up |title=Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian |work=Journal of the American Oriental Society |date=1985 |pages=597\u2013603 |first=I.&nbsp;M. |last=Diakonoff |author-link=Igor M.

Some of the terms he gives admittedly have an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] provenance, but he suggests they were borrowed through Hurrian or Urartian. Given that these borrowings do not undergo [[sound change]]s characteristic of the development of Armenian from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], he dates their borrowing to a time before the written record but after the [[Proto-Armenian language]] stage.\n\nLoan words from [[Iranian languages]], along with the other ancient accounts such as that of Xenophon above, initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. Scholars such as [[Paul de Lagarde]] and F.

He showed that Armenian often had 2 morphemes for the one concept, and the non-Iranian components yielded a consistent [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] pattern distinct from Iranian, and also demonstrated that the inflectional morphology was different from that in Iranian languages.\n\n===Graeco-Armenian hypothesis===\n{{Main article|Graeco-Armenian}}\n\nThe hypothesis that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] (1924), who noted that the number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. [[Antoine Meillet]] (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European period]]. Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his ''Esquisse'' (1936). [[Georg Renatus Solta]] (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. [[Eric P. Hamp]] (1976, 91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time \"when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian\" (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]], and a negator derived from the set phrase [[Proto-Indo-European language]] {{PIE|*''ne h\u2082oyu k\u02b7id''}} (\"never anything\" or \"always nothing\"), and the representation of word-initial [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. Nevertheless, as Fortson (2004) comments, \"by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD, the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces\".\n\n===Greco-Armeno-Aryan hypothesis===\n{{main article|Graeco-Aryan}}\n\nGraeco-(Armeno)-Aryan is a hypothetical [[clade]] within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]], ancestral to the [[Greek language]], the Armenian language, and the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].  Graeco-Aryan unity would have become divided into [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] by the mid-third millennium BC. Conceivably, [[Proto-Armenian language|Proto-Armenian]] would have been located between Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian, consistent with the fact that Armenian shares certain features only with Indo-Iranian (the ''[[satem]]'' change) but others only with Greek (''s'' > ''h'').\n\nGraeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists for the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European homeland]] to be located in the [[Armenian Highlands]], the \"[[Armenian hypothesis]]\".<ref>Renfrew, A.C., 1987, ''Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins'', London: Pimlico. {{ISBN|0-7126-6612-5}}; [[Tamaz V.

The thematic shift from mainly religious texts to writings with secular outlooks further enhanced and enriched the vocabulary. \u201cA Word of Wisdom\u201d, a poem by Hovhannes Sargavak devoted to a starling, legitimizes poetry devoted to nature, love, or female beauty. Gradually, the interests of the population at large were reflected in other literary works as well. Konsdantin Yerzinkatsi and several others even take the unusual step of criticizing the ecclesiastic establishment and addressing the social issues of the Armenian homeland. However, these changes represented the nature of the literary style and syntax, but they did not constitute immense changes to the fundamentals of the grammar or the morphology of the language. Often, when writers codify a spoken dialect, other language users are then encouraged to imitate that structure through the literary device known as [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0160vejcer|first=Aleksandr D.|title=Contemporary Sociolinguistics: Theory, Problems, Methods|year=1986|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|isbn=9027215189|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQhCAAAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Four Gospels, 1495, Portrait of St Mark Wellcome L0031107.jpg|thumb|The Four Gospels, 1495, Portrait of St Mark Wellcome with Armenian inscriptions]]\n\n[[File:The first Bible printed in the Armenian language.jpg|thumb|left|First printed Armenian language Bible, 1666]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland was once again divided. This time [[Eastern Armenia]] was conquered from [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] by the [[Russian Empire]], while [[Western Armenia]], containing two thirds of historical Armenia, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control. The antagonistic relationship between the Russian and Ottoman empires led to creation of two separate and different environments under which Armenians lived and suffered. Halfway through the 19th century, two important concentrations of Armenian communities were further consolidated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khachaturian|first1=Lisa|title=Cultivating nationhood in imperial Russia the periodical press and the formation of a modern Armenian identity|year=2009|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=1412813727|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0uY_tuRcx8C}}</ref> Because of persecutions or the search for better economic opportunities, many Armenians living under Ottoman rule gradually moved to [[Constantinople]], whereas [[Tbilisi]] became the center of Armenians living under Russian rule.

This created an ever-growing need to elevate the vernacular, Ashkharhabar, to the dignity of a modern literary language, in contrast to the now-anachronistic Grabar. Numerous dialects existed in the traditional Armenian regions, which, different as they were, had certain morphological and phonetic features in common. On the basis of these features two major standards emerged:\n* Western standard: The influx of immigrants from different parts of the traditional Armenian homeland to Constantinople crystallized the common elements of the regional dialects, paving the way to a style of writing that required a shorter and more flexible learning curve than Grabar.\n* Eastern standard: The [[Yerevan dialect]] provided the primary elements of Eastern Armenian, centered in Tbilisi, Georgia. Similar to the Western Armenian variant, the Modern Eastern was in many ways more practical and accessible to the masses than Grabar.\n\nBoth centers vigorously pursued the promotion of Ashkharhabar. The proliferation of newspapers in both versions (Eastern & Western) and the development of a network of schools where modern Armenian was taught, dramatically increased the rate of literacy (in spite of the obstacles by the colonial administrators), even in remote rural areas. The emergence of literary works entirely written in the modern versions increasingly legitimized the language\u2019s existence. By the turn of the 20th century both varieties of the one modern Armenian language prevailed over Grabar and opened the path to a new and simplified grammatical structure of the language in the two different cultural spheres. Apart from several morphological, phonetic, and grammatical differences, the largely common vocabulary and generally analogous rules of grammatical fundamentals allows users of one variant to understand the other as long as they are fluent in one of the literary standards.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=Bella|title=Armenia in pictures|year=2009|publisher=VGS/Twenty-First Century Books|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0822585766|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFN6SuymI00C}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the existence of the two modern versions of the same language was sanctioned even more clearly. The [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (1920\u20131990) used Eastern Armenian as its official language, whereas the diaspora created after the [[Armenian Genocide]] preserved the Western Armenian dialect.\n\n===Modern changes===\n[[File:Panneau pr\u00e8s d'Ohanavan.JPG|thumb|Armenian language road sign.]]\nThe two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their [[Turkic loanwords in Armenian|Turkish lexical influences]] in the 20th century, primarily following the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9KoAkzfVqIC&lpg=PA315&dq=armenian%20lexical%20purification&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q=purified&f=false|title=Progress in language planning: International Perspectives|last=Cobarrubias|first=Juan|last2=Fishman|first2=Joshua A.|publisher=Mouton Publishers|year=1983|isbn=902793388X|location=Berlin|pages=315, 319}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] voiceless [[stop consonants]] are aspirated in the [[Proto-Armenian language]], one of the circumstances that is often linked to the [[glottalic theory]], a version of which postulated that the voiceless occlusives of Proto-Indo-European were aspirated.<ref>James Clackson, ''Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (2007, Cambridge)<br/>Robert S.P.

In modern Armenian, the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in \"he will go\") has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of [[Classical Armenian]]. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English \"he goes\" and \"he does not go\") in many tenses, otherwise adding only the negative {{lang|hy|\u0579}} to the positive conjugation. Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations, adding some [[analytic language|analytic]] features.\n\n===Noun===\nClassical Armenian has no [[grammatical gender]], not even in the pronoun, but there is a feminine suffix ({{lang|hy|-\u0578\u0582\u0570\u056b}} \"-uhi\"). For example, {{lang|hy|\u0578\u0582\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0581\u056b\u0579}} (''usuts'ich'', \"teacher\") becomes {{lang|hy|\u0578\u0582\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0579\u0578\u0582\u0570\u056b}} (''usuts'chuhi'', female teacher). This suffix, however, does not have a grammatical effect on the sentence. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. Nouns are declined for one of seven cases: [[nominative case|nominative]] (\u0578\u0582\u0572\u0572\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 ''uxxakan''), [[accusative case|accusative]]

verbs}}\n\nVerbs in Armenian have an expansive system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] with two main verb types in Eastern Armenian and three in Western Armenian changing form based on [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].\n\n==Dialects==\n{{See also|Classification des dialectes arm\u00e9niens}}\n[[File:Armenian dialects, Adjarian 1909.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the [[Historical dialects of Armenian|Armenian dialects in early 20th century]]:\n{{legend|#00FF00|-owm dialects, nearly corresponding to Eastern Armenian}}\n{{legend|#808080|-el dialects (intermediate)}}\n{{legend|#FFD800|-g\u00eb dialects, nearly corresponding to Western Armenian}}]]\nArmenian is a [[pluricentric language]], having two modern [[Standard language|standardized]] forms: [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]]. The most distinctive feature of Western Armenian is that it has undergone several phonetic mergers; these may be due to proximity to Arabic- and Turkish-speaking communities.\n\nFor example, Eastern Armenian speakers pronounce ({{lang|hy|\u0569}}) as [t\u02b0], ({{lang|hy|\u0564}}) as [d], and ({{lang|hy|\u057f}}) as a [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] occlusive [t\u02ed]. Western Armenian has simplified the occlusive system into a simple division between voiced occlusives and aspirated ones; the first series corresponds to the tenuis series of Eastern Armenian, and the second corresponds to the Eastern voiced and aspirated series. Thus, the Western dialect pronounces both ({{lang|hy|\u0569}}) and ({{lang|hy|\u0564}}) as [t\u02b0], and the ({{lang|hy|\u057f}}) letter as [d].\n\nThere is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects.\n\nArmenian can be divided into two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have become extinct due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Although Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, many subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is also literate in one of the standards, when exposed to the other dialect for a period of time will be able to understand the other with relative ease.\n\nDistinct Western Armenian varieties currently in use include [[Homshetsi dialect|Homshetsi]], spoken by the [[Hemshin people]];<ref>{{cite book|author1=Victor A.

It was introduced around AD 405 by [[Mesrop Mashtots]], an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, \u0585 (o) and \u0586 (f), were added in the Middle Ages. \nDuring the [[Armenian orthography reform of 1922\u20131924|1920s orthography reform]] in Soviet Armenia, a new letter \u0587 (capital \u0535\u054e) was added, which was a ligature before \u0565+\u0582, whereas the letter \u0552 \u0582 was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter \u0548\u0552 \u0578\u0582 (which was a digraph before). This alphabet and associated orthography is used by most Armenian speakers of the Republic of Armenia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Neither the alphabet nor the orthography has been adopted by Diaspora Armenians, including Eastern Armenian speakers of Iran and all Western Armenian speakers, who keep using the traditional alphabet and spelling.\n\n==Indo-European cognates==\nArmenian is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], so many of its [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]-descended words are [[cognate]]s of words in other Indo-European languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]]. This table lists only some of the more recognizable cognates that Armenian shares with English (more specifically, with English words descended from [[Old English]]).

Each partial is a sine wave of different [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] that swells and decays over time due to [[modulation]] from an [[ADSR envelope]] or [[low frequency oscillator]].\n\nAdditive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators. Alternative implementations may use pre-computed [[Wavetable synthesis|wavetables]] or the inverse [[Fast Fourier transform]].\n\n== Explanation ==\nThe sounds that are heard in everyday life are not characterized by a single [[frequency]]. Instead, they consist of a sum of pure sine frequencies, each one at a different [[amplitude]]. When humans hear these frequencies simultaneously, we can recognize the sound. This is true for both \"non-musical\" sounds (e.g. water splashing, leaves rustling, etc.) and for \"musical sounds\" (e.g. a piano note, a bird's tweet, etc.). This set of parameters (frequencies, their relative amplitudes, and how the relative amplitudes change over time) are encapsulated by the ''[[timbre]]'' of the sound. [[Fourier analysis]] is the technique that is used to determine these exact timbre parameters from an overall sound signal; conversely, the resulting set of frequencies and amplitudes is called the [[Fourier series]] of the original sound signal.\n\nIn the case of a musical note, the lowest frequency of its timbre is designated as the sound's [[fundamental frequency]]. For simplicity, we often say that the note is playing at that fundamental frequency (e.g. \"[[middle C]] is 261.6 Hz\"),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liutaiomottola.com/formulae/freqtab.htm|title=Table of Musical Notes and Their Frequencies and Wavelengths|last=Mottola|first=Liutaio|date=May 31, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> even though the sound of that note consists of many other frequencies as well. The set of the remaining frequencies is called the [[overtone]]s (or the [[harmonic]]s) of the sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/Lesson-4/Fundamental-Frequency-and-Harmonics|title=Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> In other words, the fundamental frequency alone is responsible for the pitch of the note, while the overtones define the timbre of the sound. The overtones of a piano playing middle C will be quite different from the overtones of a violin playing the same note; that's what allows us to differentiate the sounds of the two instruments. There are even subtle differences in timbre between different versions of the same instrument (for example, an [[upright piano]] vs. a [[Grand Piano|grand piano]]).\n\nAdditive synthesis aims to exploit this property of sound in order to construct timbre from the ground up. By adding together pure frequencies ([[sine wave]]s) of varying frequencies and amplitudes, we can precisely define the timbre of the sound that we want to create.\n\n==Definitions==\n{{See also|Fourier series|Fourier analysis}}\n{| style=\"float: right;\" border=\"0\"\n| valign=\"top\" | [[File:Additive synthesis.svg|250px|thumb|Schematic diagram of additive synthesis. The inputs to the oscillators are frequencies <math>f_k\\,</math> and amplitudes <math>r_k\\,</math>.]]\n|}\n\nHarmonic additive synthesis is closely related to the concept of a [[Fourier series]] which is a way of expressing a [[periodic function]] as the sum of [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] functions with [[Frequency|frequencies]] equal to integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]].  These sinusoids are called [[harmonic]]s, [[overtone]]s, or generally, [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]].  In general, a Fourier series contains an infinite number of sinusoidal components, with no upper limit to the frequency of the sinusoidal functions and includes a [[direct current|DC]] component (one with frequency of 0 [[Hertz|Hz]]).  [[Equal-loudness contour|Frequencies outside of the human audible range]] can be omitted in additive synthesis.  As a result, only a finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the audible range are modeled in additive synthesis.\n\nA waveform or function is said to be [[periodic function|periodic]] if\n\n: <math> y(t) = y(t+P) \\ </math>\n\nfor all <math> t \\,</math> and for some period <math> P \\,</math>.\n\nThe [[Fourier series]] of a periodic function is mathematically expressed as:\n\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n  y(t) &= \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ a_k \\cos(2 \\pi k f_0 t ) - b_k \\sin(2 \\pi k f_0 t ) \\right] \\\\\n       &= \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} r_k \\cos\\left(2 \\pi k f_0 t + \\phi_k \\right) \\\\\n   \\end{align} </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:: <math>f_0 = 1/P\\,</math> is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and is equal to the reciprocal of the period,\n:: <math>a_k = r_k \\cos(\\phi_k) = 2 f_0 \\int_{0}^P y(t) \\cos(2 \\pi k f_0 t)\\, dt, \\quad k \\ge 0\\,</math>\n:: <math>b_k = r_k \\sin(\\phi_k) = -2 f_0 \\int_{0}^P y(t) \\sin(2 \\pi k f_0 t)\\, dt, \\quad k \\ge 1\\,</math>\n:: <math>r_k = \\sqrt{a_k^2 + b_k^2}\\,</math> is the [[amplitude]] of the <math>k\\,</math>th harmonic,\n:: <math>\\phi_k = \\operatorname{atan2}(b_k, a_k)\\,</math> is the [[phase (waves)|phase offset]] of the <math>k\\,</math>th harmonic.

Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy [[balloon]]s to [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] warships that carry numerous [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[strike aircraft]], [[military helicopter|helicopters]], and other types of aircraft. While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing [[gunship]]s and [[bomber]]s have been launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them. By its diplomatic and tactical power, its mobility, its autonomy and the variety of its means, the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets. Tactically or even strategically, it replaced the [[battleship]] in the role of flagship of a fleet. One of its great advantages is that, by sailing in international waters, it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third party countries, reduce the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone.\n\nThere is no single definition of an \"aircraft carrier\",<ref name=\"gscarrier\">{{Citation|title=Military|publisher=Global Security|url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers.htm|contribution=World Wide Aircraft Carriers}}</ref> and modern navies use several variants of the type.

China, France, India, Russia, and the UK each operate a single large/medium-size carrier, with capacity from 30 to 60 fighter jets. Italy operates two light fleet carriers and Spain operates one. [[Helicopter carriers]] are operated by Japan (4), France (3), Australia (2), Egypt (2), Brazil (1), South Korea (1), and Thailand (1).

These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, ''[[escort carrier]]s'' were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. ''[[Light aircraft carrier]]s'' were fast enough to operate with the main fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity. Soviet aircraft carriers now in use by Russia are actually called ''heavy aviation cruisers''; these ships, while sized in the range of large fleet carriers, were designed to deploy alone or with escorts, and provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser, in addition to supporting fighters and helicopters.\n\n===By configuration===\n[[File:INS Vikramaditya (R33) close shot.jpg|thumb|{{INS|Vikramaditya}} of the [[Indian Navy]] has the [[STOBAR]] configuration.]]\n\nAircraft carriers today are usually divided into the following four categories based on the way that aircraft take off and land:\n* ''Catapult-assisted take-off barrier arrested-recovery'' (''[[CATOBAR]]''): these carriers generally carry the largest, heaviest, and most heavily armed aircraft, although smaller CATOBAR carriers may have other limitations (weight capacity of aircraft elevator, etc.). All CATOBAR carriers in service today are nuclear powered. Two nations currently operate carriers of this type: ten ''Nimitz'' class and one ''Gerald R. Ford'' class fleet carriers by the United States, and one medium-sized carrier by France, for a world total of twelve in service.\n* ''Short take-off but arrested-recovery'' (''[[STOBAR]]''): these carriers are generally limited to carrying lighter fixed-wing aircraft with more limited payloads. STOBAR carrier air wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-33]] and future [[Mikoyan MiG-29K]] wings of {{Ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} are often geared primarily towards air superiority and fleet defense roles rather than strike/power projection tasks,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which require heavier payloads (bombs and air-to-ground missiles). Today China, India, and Russia each operate one carrier of this type \u2013 a total of three in service currently.\n* ''Short take-off vertical-landing'' (''[[STOVL]]''): limited to carrying STOVL aircraft. STOVL aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family and [[Yakovlev Yak-38]] generally have limited payloads, lower performance, and high fuel consumption when compared with conventional fixed-wing aircraft; however, a new generation of STOVL aircraft, currently consisting of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]]B, has much improved performance. The US has nine STOVL amphibious assault ships. The UK has a class of two 65,000 ton<ref name=\"HMSQE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/surface-fleet/aircraft-carriers/hms-queen-elizabeth|title=HMS ''Queen Elizabeth''|publisher=royalnavy.mod.uk|accessdate=12 January 2018}}</ref> STOVL aircraft carriers, [[List of aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'' and HMS ''Prince of Wales'']], the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy; with one in service and the other being fitted out. Italy operates two in the light fleet role, and Spain operates one amphibious assault ship as a STOVL aircraft carrier, giving a total of thirteen STOVL carriers in active service; (Thailand has one active STOVL carrier but she no longer has any operational STOVL aircraft in inventory so is used and counted as a helicopter carrier). \n* ''[[Helicopter carrier]]'': Helicopter carriers have a similar appearance to other aircraft carriers but operate only helicopters \u2013 those that mainly operate helicopters but can also operate fixed-wing aircraft are known as STOVL carriers (see above). There are currently fourteen helicopter carriers (that solely operate helicopters and not fixed-wing aircraft), operated by seven navies, in commission today. Japan has four of this type, France three, Australia two, Egypt two, and South Korea, Thailand, and Brazil have one each. In the past, some conventional carriers were converted and called [[Amphibious assault ship|commando carriers]] by the Royal Navy. Some helicopter carriers, but not all, are classified as [[amphibious assault ships]], tasked with landing and supporting ground forces on enemy territory.\n\n===By size===\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano.jpg|thumb|right|The Japanese carrier [[Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Shinano|''Shinano'']] was the biggest carrier in World War II, and the largest ship destroyed by a submarine.<ref>Enright & Ryan, p. xiv</ref>]]\n\n* [[Fleet carrier]]\n* [[Light aircraft carrier]]\n* [[Escort carrier]]\n\n===Supercarrier===\n{{For|the fictional drama television series|Supercarrier (TV series)}}\nThe appellation \"supercarrier\" is not an official designation with any national navy, but a term used predominantly by the media and typically when reporting on new and upcoming aircraft carrier types.

These conversions gave rise to the US {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}<nowiki/>s (1927), Japanese {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, and British {{sclass-|Courageous|aircraft carrier|4}}. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s. This resulted in the commissioning of ships such as the Japanese {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|H\u014dsh\u014d||2}} (1922),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/world/gallery/japanese-inventions-changed-how-we-live/index.html|title=Japanese inventions that changed the world|website=CNN|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> followed by {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} (1924, although laid down before ''H\u014dsh\u014d'' in 1918) and {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} (1927).

The British aircraft carrier was involved in the crippling of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941]]\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CV-6) in Puget Sound, September 1945.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, the [[Most decorated US ships of World War II|most decorated U.S. warship of World War II]]]]\n\nThe aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in [[World War II]], because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility, and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had greater range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940, when {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched a long-range [[Battle of Taranto|strike on the Italian fleet]] at their base in [[Taranto]], signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation in the shallow water harbor incapacitated three of the anchored six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|World War II in the Pacific Ocean]] involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The Japanese surprise attack on the American Pacific fleet at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] naval / air bases on Sunday, 7 December 1941, was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. Further versatility was demonstrated during the \"[[Doolittle Raid]]\", on 18 April 1942, when US Navy carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8}} sailed to within 650 nautical miles of Japan and launched 16 [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] from her deck in a retaliatory strike on the mainland, including the capital, [[Tokyo]]. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of {{HMS|Glorious}} by German battleships during the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian campaign in 1940]].\n\nThis new-found importance of [[naval aviation]] forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage led to the development and construction of 'light' carriers. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were sometimes purpose-built but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, [[light aircraft carrier]]s built by the U.S., such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}, represented a larger, more \"militarized\" version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls. The UK [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier]] was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robbins |first=Guy |title=The Aircraft Carrier Story: 1908\u20131945 |year=2001 |location=London |publisher=Cassel |page=91 |isbn=978-0-30435-308-8}}</ref> They served the Royal Navy during the war, and the hull design was chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war, until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range land-based German aircraft.\n\n===Postwar era===\n[[File:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|USS ''Tripoli'', a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ''Iwo Jima''-class helicopter carrier]]\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CVN-65).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}}, \"The Big E\", the world's first nuclear-powered carrier, commissioned in 1961]]\n\nBefore World War II, international naval treaties of [[Washington Naval Treaty|1922]], [[London Naval Treaty|1930]], and [[Second London Naval Treaty|1936]] limited the size of capital ships including carriers. Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size. The large, modern {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of U.S.N. carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II\u2013era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same\u2014a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of individual military aircraft over the years. Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, social and military impact if a carrier is lost, or is even sent to a potential crisis zone or used in conflict.\n\nModern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously held by the sailing galleons, frigates and ships-of-the-line and later steam or diesel powered [[battleship]]. This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare, driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance, and along with, carrier designs also increased in size and ability. Some of these larger carriers, dubbed by the media as \"supercarriers\", displacing 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Some are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. Amphibious assault ships, such as the {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|5}} and {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|5}} classes, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines, and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as \"commando carriers\"<ref>A number of British conversions of light fleet carriers to helicopter operations were known as commando carriers, though they did not operate landing craft</ref> or \"helicopter carriers\", many have the capability to operate [[VSTOL]] aircraft.\n\nLacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines, or missiles. Therefore, an aircraft carrier is generally accompanied by a number of other ships to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies and perform other support services, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. The resulting group of ships is often termed a battle group, carrier group, [[carrier battle group]] or [[carrier strike group]].\n\nThere is a view among some military pundits that modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, or even ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads have made aircraft carriers and carrier groups obsolete as too vulnerable for modern combat.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-05/twilight-uperfluous-carrier |first1=Henry J. |last1=Hendrix |first2=J.

Roosevelt|CV-42|6}}]]\n\nCarriers are large and long ships, although there is a high degree of variation depending on their intended role and [[air wing|aircraft complement]]. The size of the carrier has varied over history and among [[navy|navies]], to cater to the various roles that global climates have demanded from [[naval aviation]].\n\nRegardless of size, the ship itself must house their complement of aircraft, with space for launching, storing, and maintaining them. Space is also required for the large crew, supplies (food, munitions, fuel, engineering parts), and propulsion. US aircraft carriers are notable for having [[nuclear reactor]]s powering their systems and propulsion. This makes the carrier reasonably tall.\n\nThe top of the carrier is the flight deck, where aircraft are launched and recovered. On the starboard side of this is the island, where air-traffic control and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] are located.\n\nThe constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly, as they influence the weight, type, and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched. For example, assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft, especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons. CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN fleet carriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts, especially on ground-attack missions. STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for [[fighter aircraft]].\n\n[[File:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft: [[Eric \"Winkle\" Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68|6}} in 1945]]\nDue to the busy nature of the flight deck, only 20 or so aircraft may be on it at any one time. A hangar storage several decks below the flight deck is where most aircraft are kept, and aircraft are taken from the lower storage decks to the flight deck through the use of an elevator. The hangar is usually quite large and can take up several decks of vertical space.<ref>How Aircraft Carriers Work, ''How Stuff Works'', by Tom Harris \u2013 http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier6.htm Accessed 5 October 2013</ref>\n\nMunitions are commonly stored on the lower decks because they are highly explosive. Usually this is below the water line so that the area can be flooded in case of emergency.\n\n===Flight deck===\n{{Main article|Flight deck}}\n[[File:US Navy 081124-N-3659B-305 F-A-18C Hornets launch from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|[[Catapult]] launches aboard {{USS|Ronald Reagan}}]]\n[[File:Vikramaditya 5.jpg|thumb|Expansive flight deck of {{INS|Vikramaditya}} at night showing the [[Flight Deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski-jump ramp]] used for [[STOBAR]] configuration]]\n\nAs \"runways at sea\", aircraft carriers have a flat-top [[flight deck]], which [[Takeoff|launches]] and [[landing|recovers]] aircraft. Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier. For example, the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft [[accelerate]] more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.\n\nThere are two main philosophies in order to keep the deck short: add thrust to the aircraft, such as using a Catapult Assisted Take-Off (CATO-); and changing the direction of the airplanes' thrust, as in Vertical and/or Short Take-Off (V/STO-). Each method has advantages and disadvantages of its own:\n* [[CATOBAR|Catapult assisted take-off but arrested recovery]] (CATOBAR): A steam- or electric-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is connected to the aircraft, and is used to accelerate conventional aircraft to a safe flying speed. By the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft is airborne and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. This is the most expensive method as it requires complex machinery to be installed under the flight deck, but allows for even heavily loaded aircraft to take off.\n* [[STOBAR|Short take-off but arrested recovery]] (STOBAR) depends on increasing the net lift on the aircraft. Aircraft do not require catapult assistance for take off; instead on nearly all ships of this type an upwards vector is provided by a ski-jump at the forward end of the flight deck, often combined with thrust vectoring by the aircraft. Alternatively, by reducing the fuel and weapon load, an aircraft is able to reach faster speeds and generate more upwards lift and launch without a ski-jump or catapult.\n* [[STOVL|Short take-off vertical-landing]] (STOVL): On aircraft carriers, non-catapult-assisted, fixed-wing short takeoffs are accomplished with the use of [[thrust vectoring]], which may also be used in conjunction with a runway \"ski-jump\". Use of STOVL tends to allow aircraft to carry a larger payload as compared to during VTOL use, while still only requiring a short runway. The most famous examples are the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] and the [[Sea Harrier]]. Although technically VTOL aircraft, they are operationally STOVL aircraft due to the extra weight carried at take-off for fuel and armaments. The same is true of the [[F-35B Lightning II]], which demonstrated VTOL capability in test flights but is operationally STOVL.\n* [[VTOL|Vertical take-off and landing]] (VTOL): Aircraft are specifically designed for the purpose of using very high degrees of thrust vectoring (e.g. if the thrust to weight-force ratio is greater than 1, it can take off vertically), but are usually slower than conventionally propelled aircraft.\n\nOn the recovery side of the flight deck, the adaptation to the aircraft loadout is mirrored. Non-VTOL or conventional aircraft cannot decelerate on their own, and almost all carriers using them must have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR, e.g. CATO''BAR'' or STO''BAR'') to recover their aircraft. Aircraft that are landing extend a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring themselves to a stop in a short distance. Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to \"bolt\" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.\n\nIf the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters, they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because, in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway. It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area. [[Helicopter]]s and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ([[V/STOL]]) usually recover by coming abreast of the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.\n\n====Staff and deck operations====\n[[File:F-18 - A 3-wire landing.ogv|thumb|F/A-18 Hornet aircraft landing video]]\n\nCarriers steam at speed, up to {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}} into the wind during flight deck operations to increase wind speed over the deck to a safe minimum. This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft at the end of the catapult stroke or ski-jump, as well as making recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.\n\nSince the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]], to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two \"waist\" catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An angled deck also improves [[launch and recovery cycle]] flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.\n\nConventional (\"tailhook\") aircraft rely upon a [[Landing Signal Officer|landing signal officer]] (LSO, radio call sign ''paddles'') to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as the [[optical landing system]] have provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.\n\n[[File:USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75) Flight Deck.JPG|thumb|[[F/A-18 Hornet]]s on the flight deck of the {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|0}} carrier {{USS|Harry S.

Shooters are [[naval aviator]]s or [[naval flight officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery. The \"air boss\" (usually a [[commander]]) occupies the top bridge (Primary Flight Control, also called ''primary'' or ''the tower'') and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch, recovery and \"those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |title= The US Navy Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=30 January 2009 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221142917/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |archivedate= 21 February 2009}}</ref> The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the Navigation Bridge. Below this is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.\n\nTo facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. There are at least seven different colors worn by flight deck personnel for [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]]. Carrier operations of other nations use similar color schemes.\n\n====Deck structures====\n[[File:US Navy 100512-N-8446A-004 An F-A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the Fighting Checkmates of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 211 lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65).jpg|thumb|Island control structure of {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}]]\n\nThe superstructure of a carrier (such as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]]) are concentrated in a relatively small area called an ''island'', a feature pioneered on {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} in 1923. While the island is usually built on the [[starboard]] side of the flight deck, the Japanese aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}} had their islands built on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island. The ''flush deck'' configuration proved to have significant drawbacks, primary of which was management of the exhaust from the power plant. Fumes coming across the deck were a major issue in {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}}. In addition, lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck, performing air traffic control, a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|pp=241\u2013243}}\n\nAnother deck structure that can be seen is a [[ski-jump ramp]] at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch [[STOVL]] aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]] or crashing directly into the sea.\n\n[[File:FRS.1 ski-jump take-off HMS Invincible.JPEG|thumb|left|Ski-jump on Royal Navy carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}]]\nAlthough STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment, vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.\n\nThe disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket. For example, the Russian Su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} with a minimal armament and fuel load. Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a US [[landing helicopter dock]] or [[landing helicopter assault]] amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas, this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.\n\n==National fleets==\n[[File:World Navy Aircraft carries chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Chart comparing a range of aircraft and helicopter carriers, in order of longest (top left) to shortest (bottom right)]]\n{{See also|List of aircraft carriers by country|List of aircraft carriers in service}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy has the largest carriers in the world, and currently has eleven in service. The UK operates one 65,000 tonne STOVL carrier. The navies of China, France, India, and Russia each operate a single medium-sized fleet carrier.

The apical complex consists of a set of spirally arranged [[microtubule]]s (the [[conoid (organelle)|conoid]]), a secretory body (the [[rhoptry]]) and one or more [[polar ring]]s. Additional slender electron-dense secretory bodies ([[microneme]]s) surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present. This structure gives the phylum its name.\n\nA further group of spherical organelles is distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the [[apical complex]] and are known as the dense granules. These typically have a mean diameter around 0.7 \u03bcm. Secretion of the dense-granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the [[parasitophorous vacuole]] and persists for several minutes.\n\nOther morphological findings common to all members of this phylum include:\n*The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] is [[haploid]].\n*[[Flagellum|Flagella]] are found only in the motile gamete. These are posteriorly directed and vary in number (usually one to three).\n*[[Basal body|Basal bodies]] are present.

This gliding ability is made possible by the use of adhesions and small static myosin motors.\n\nOther features common to this phylum are a lack of cilia, sexual reproduction, use of micropores for feeding, and the production of oocysts containing sporozoites as the infective form.\n\nMost apicomplexans have an [[apicoplast]], (a nonphotosynthetic plastid) and [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]]  and [[nuclear genome]]s, although ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' species and [[gregarines]] are possible exceptions, as they are thought to have lost their plastids after the diverging [[last common ancestor]] of apicomplexans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==General features of the subgroups==\nWithin this phylum are three groups\u2014coccidians, gregarines, and haemosporidians.

They are often found in the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]s of their hosts, but may invade the other tissues. In the typical gregarine lifecycle, a [[trophozoite]] develops within a host cell into a schizont. This then divides into a number of [[merozoite]]s by [[schizogony]]. The [[merozoite]]s are released by lysing the host cell, which in turn invade other cells. At some point in the apicomplexan lifecycle, [[gametocytes]] are formed. These are released by lysis of the host cells, which group together. Each gametocyte forms multiple [[gamete]]s. The gametes fuse with another to form [[oocyst]]s. The oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host.\n\n===Coccidians===\n[[File:Toxoplasma gondii.jpg|thumb|150px|Dividing ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' (Coccidia) parasites]]\n{{Main|Coccidia}}\nIn general, coccidians are parasites of [[vertebrate]]s. Like gregarines, they are commonly parasites of the [[epithelial]] cells of the gut, but may infect other tissues.\n\nThe coccidian lifecycle involves merogony, gametogony, and sporogony. While similar to that of the gregarines it differs in [[zygote]] formation. Some trophozoites enlarge and become [[macrogamete]], whereas others divide repeatedly to form [[microgamete]]s (anisogamy). The microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it. The fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote that in its turn forms an oocyst that is normally released from the body. Syzygy, when it occurs, involves markedly anisogamous gametes. The lifecycle is typically haploid, with the only diploid stage occurring in the zygote, which is normally short-lived.\n\nThe main difference between the coccidians and the gregarines is in the gamonts. In the coccidia, these are small, intracellular, and without [[epimerite]]s or [[mucron]]s. In the gregarines, these are large, extracellular, and possess epimerites or mucrons. A second difference between the coccidia and the gregarines also lies in the gamonts. In the coccidians, a single gamont becomes a macrogametocyte, whereas in the gregarines, the gamonts give rise to multiple gametocytes.\n\n===Haemosporidia===\n[[File:Immature and mature trophozoites of the Plasmodium vivax parasite PHIL 2720 lores.jpg|thumb|150px|upright=1.3|Trophozoites of the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' (Haemosporidia) parasite among human red blood cells]]\n{{Main|Haemosporida}}\nThe Haemosporidia have more complex lifecycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host. The trophozoite parasitises [[erythrocyte]]s or other tissues in the vertebrate host. Microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood. The gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal. The microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes. The fertilized macrogamete now becomes an [[ookinete]], which penetrates the body of the vector. The ookinete then transforms into an oocyst and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis (haplontic lifecycle) to give rise to the [[sporozoite]]s. The sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again.\n\n==Reproduction and lifecycle==\n{{further|Apicomplexa lifecycle stages}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 260\n| image1 =Apicomplexa life cycle v2.svg\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =Generic lifecycle of an Apicomplexa: 1-[[zygote]] ([[Microbial cyst|cyst]]), 2-[[sporozoite]]s, 3-[[merozoite]]s, 4-[[gametocyte]]s\n}}\n\nMost members have a complex lifecycle, involving both asexual and sexual reproduction.  Typically, a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to [[entosis]]), which divide to produce [[sporozoite]]s that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing [[merozoites]], which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until gamonts are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  Many variations occur on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.\n\nThe apical complex includes [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the polar ring, and among the Conoidasida is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the conoid.<ref name=coccidiaworld>{{cite web |url=http://biology.unm.edu/biology/coccidia/home.html|title=The Coccidia of the World| last = Duszynski| first = Donald W. | first2 = Steve J. |last2=Upton |first3=Lee |last3=Couch| publisher = Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, and Division of Biology, Kansas State University| date = 2004-02-21| format = Online database }}</ref>   Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semirigid pellicle.\n\nThe presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s. Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''[[Colpodella]]'', have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.\n\nAnother similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the [[apicoplast]], surrounded by either three or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis, and it appears to be necessary for survival.  In general, plastids are considered to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from [[red algae]] rather than [[green alga|green]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481\u20131493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

This makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult \u2013 a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host. At present, no effective [[vaccine]]s are available for most diseases caused by these parasites. Biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult, if not impossible, to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms. In recent years, several of the apicomplexan species have been selected for [[genome sequencing]].

In the genera ''[[Aggregata]]'', ''[[Atoxoplasma]]'', ''[[Cystoisospora]]'', ''[[Schellackia]]'', and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', the original is now definitive, whereas in ''[[Akiba (protozoa)|Akiba]]'', ''[[Babesiosoma]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', ''[[Haemogregarina]]'', ''[[Haemoproteus]]'', ''[[Hepatozoon]]'', ''[[Karyolysus]]'', ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'', ''[[Plasmodium]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', and ''[[Theileria]]'', the original hosts are now intermediate.\n\nSimilar strategies to increase the likelihood of transmission have evolved in multiple genera. Polyenergid [[oocyst]]s and tissue cysts are found in representatives of the orders [[Protococcidiorida]] and [[Eimeriida]]. [[Hypnozoite]]s are found in ''[[Karyolysus lacerate]]'' and most species of ''[[Plasmodium]]''; transovarial transmission of parasites occurs in lifecycles of ''[[Karyolysus]]'' and ''[[Babesia]]''.\n\nHorizontal gene transfer appears to have occurred early on in this phylum's evolution with the transfer of a [[histone H4]] lysine 20 (H4K20) [[Histone#Chromatin regulation|modifier]], [[KMT5A]] (Set8), from an animal host to the ancestor of apicomplexans.<ref name=Kishore2013>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kishore SP, Stiller JW, Deitsch KW |title=Horizontal gene transfer of epigenetic machinery and evolution of parasitism in the malaria parasite ''Plasmodium falciparum'' and other apicomplexans |journal=BMC Evol.

[[Spanish Argentine|Spanish settlers]] came to Argentina in 1536. Between 1853 and 1955, 6.6 million immigrants came to live in Argentina from diverse sources such as [[Europe]], the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]], [[Russia]] and [[Japan]], contributing to the development of Argentine cuisine and making Argentina the second country with most immigrants only second to the United States.<ref name=\"ref1\"/><ref name=\"ref2\"/> Most of the immigrants were from Italy and Spain. The [[Italian Argentine|Italians]] introduced [[pizza]], as well as a variety of [[pasta]] dishes, including [[spaghetti]] and [[lasagna]]. [[English Argentine|British]], [[German Argentine|German]], [[Jewish Argentine|Jewish]], and other immigrants also settled in Argentina, all bringing their styles of cooking and favorite foods with them. The British brought [[tea]], starting the tradition of [[teatime]]. All of these cultures influenced the dishes of Argentina.<ref name=\"Food\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Argentina.html#b|title=Food in Argentina - Argentine Food, Argentine Cuisine - popular, dishes, history, main, people, favorite, make, customs, fruits, country|website=Foodbycountry.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Typical foods==\n[[File:Dulce de leche 2007.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|[[Dulce de leche]], a popular national spread used to fill cakes and pancakes, eaten over toast, and as an ice cream flavor.]]\n[[File:Empanadas salte\u00f1as 1.jpg|thumb|left|Boxed [[Empanada]]s.]]\n\nMost regions of Argentina are known for their beef-oriented diet. The Spanish term,\"''Carne''\", which means meat, is assumed to be beef in Argentina. In other Spanish-speaking countries\u2014such as Spain\u2014the term is usually qualified  with the type of animal, such as \"''carne de vaca''\" (beef), \"''carne de cordero''\" (lamb), etc.\n\n[[Grilling|Grilled]] meat from the ''[[asado]]'' (barbecue) is a staple, with [[steak]] and beef [[Ribs (food)|ribs]] especially common. The term asado itself refers to long strips of flank-cut beef ribs. Popular items such as ''[[Chorizo]]'' ([[pork]] [[sausage]]), ''morcilla'' ([[blood sausage]]), ''chinchulines'' ([[chitterlings]]), ''mollejas'' ([[sweetbread]]), and other parts of the animal are also enjoyed. In [[Patagonia]], however, [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[chivito]] ([[goat]]) are eaten more frequently than beef. Whole lambs and goats are traditionally cooked over an open fire in a technique known as asado a la estaca.\n\nThe most common condiment for asado is ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a [[sauce]] of [[herb]]s, garlic and vinegar. Unlike other preparations, Argentines do not include chili in their version of chimichurri.\n\n[[Breading|Breaded]] and [[Frying|fried]] meats \u2014 ''[[milanesa]]s'' \u2014 are used as [[snack]]s, in [[sandwich]]es, or eaten warm with [[mashed potato]]es \u2014 ''[[pur\u00e9e]]''. ''[[Empanada]]s'' \u2014 small [[Pastry|pastries]] of meat, [[cheese]], [[sweet corn]], and a hundred other fillings \u2014 are a common sight at parties and [[picnic]]s, or as [[Entr\u00e9e|starters]] to a meal. A variation, the \"empanada gallega\" (Galician empanada), is a big, round meat pie made most commonly with [[tuna]] and [[Mackerel (food)|mackerel]] (\"''caballa''\" in Spanish). [[Vegetable]]s and [[salad]]s are also eaten by Argentines; [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[lettuce]], [[eggplant]]s, [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], and [[zucchini]] are common [[side dish]]es.\n\nItalian staples, such as pizza and pasta, are eaten as commonly as beef. ''Fideos'' ([[noodle]]s), ''tallarines'' (''[[fettucine]]'' and ''[[tagliatelle]]''), ''\u00f1oquis'' ([[gnocchi]]), ''[[Ravioli|ravioles]]'', and ''canelones'' ([[cannelloni]]) can be bought freshly made in many establishments in the larger cities. Italian-style [[ice cream]] is served in large [[parlour]]s and even drive-through businesses.\n\nIn [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh community]] is known for its [[teahouse]]s, offering [[scone (bread)|scone]]s and ''torta galesa'', which is rather like ''[[Bara Brith|torta negra]]''.\n\n''[[Sandwiches de miga]]'' are delicate sandwiches made with crustless buttered white bread, very thinly sliced [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] meat, cheese, and lettuce. They are often purchased from entrepreneurial home cooks and may be eaten for a light evening meal.\n\nA sweet [[Paste (food)|paste]], ''dulce de leche'' is another treasured national food, used to fill [[cake]]s and [[pancake]]s, spread over [[toast]]ed bread for [[breakfast]], or served with ice cream. ''[[Alfajor]]es'' are [[shortbread]] [[cookie]]s sandwiched together with [[chocolate]] and ''dulce de leche'' or a [[fruit]] paste. The \"[[police]]man's\" or \"[[truck]] driver's\" sweet is cheese with [[quince]] paste or ''[[dulce de membrillo]]''. ''[[Dulce de batata]]'' is made of [[sweet potato]]/[[yam (vegetable)|yam]]: this with cheese is the ''[[Martin Fierro|Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'''s [[sweet]]. [[Apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[kiwifruit]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[plum]]s are major [[export]]s.\n\nA traditional [[drink]] of Argentina is an [[infusion]] called [[mate (beverage)|mate]] (in Spanish, ''mate'', with the accent on the first syllable [MAH-teh]). The name comes from the hollow [[gourd]] from which it is traditionally drunk. The mate (gourd) or other small [[cup]] is filled about three-quarters full with ''yerba mate'', the dried [[Leaf|leaves]] and [[twig]]s of the ''[[Ilex paraguariensis]]''. The drink, which is rather [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], is sipped through a metal or cane [[straw]] called a ''[[bombilla]]''. Mate can be sweetened with [[sugar]], or [[flavor]]ed with [[aromatic]] herbs or dried [[orange (fruit)|orange]] [[peel (fruit)|peel]]. Hot but not boiling water is poured into the gourd, drunk, then the mate is refilled. The mate is nearly full of leaves, so each refill only makes a small drink, but many refills are possible before the yerba is spent. In small gatherings it is traditional for one ''mate'' to be passed from person to person, filled by whoever has the kettle. It is customary not to thank the refiller routinely; a final ''gracias'' (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1156709-se-toma-un-mate-segunda-parte La Naci\u00f3n newspaper: \u00bfSe toma un mate?

''[[Mate cocido]]'' is the same leaf, which rather than [[Boiling|brewed]] is [[Boiling|boiled]] and served, like [[tea]], with [[milk]] and sugar to taste.\n\nOther typical drinks include [[wine]] (sometimes with [[soda water]] added); tea and coffee are equally important. [[Quilmes]] is the national [[brand]] of [[pale lager]], named after the town of [[Quilmes, Buenos Aires]], where it was first produced.\n\n==Ingredients==\n''Argentine Cuisine'' is heavily based on the growth of all kinds of [[cereal]]s, [[grain]]s, [[oil seed]]s, [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, since [[Argentina]] is a significantly large [[livestock]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] country. In the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] waters river fish such as [[silverside (fish)|silverside]], [[Pseudoplatystoma|surubi]], dorado or [[Leporinus obtusidens|boga]] clearly stand out.<ref name=\"gastronomy\"/>\n\nMeat products have been dominant in the country since the 16th century.<ref name=\"sari\">{{cite book |last=Edelstein|first=Sari|year=2010|title=Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQoWQTVcpVIC&pg=PA478&dq=argentine+cuisine&hl=es&sa=X&ei=icQpU_HmLoaUkQf75oDwDw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=argentina&f=false|location= |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0763759650|accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref> The country is regarded as a major [[beef]], [[pork]] and [[poultry]] producing and consuming country. As a matter of fact, certain areas such as those located in the south are usually engaged in activities involving [[sheep]] and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] breeding, and [[shellfish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusc]]s and [[salmon]]ides fishing.\n\nThe vast breeding activity involving any type of [[cattle]] has given rise to a very developed [[dairy]] industry that includes products like [[cow milk|cow]], [[sheep milk|sheep]] and [[camelide]], [[cheese]], [[dulce de leche]] and [[yogurt]]s. Argentina can also be conceived as a great industry engaged in the production of [[dried fruit]]s, [[olive]]s, all types of [[oil]]s and [[spice]]s.<ref name=\"gastronomy\"/>\n\nWhen it comes to blending ingredients and readapating other latitude cuisines traditions, the almost unlimited source of raw materials above enables the existence of a great product versatility.<ref name=\"gastronomy\"/>\n\n== Regional differences ==\nArgentine cuisine is heavily influenced by its European roots and has regional variations. ''Asado'', ''dulce de leche'', ''empanadas'', and ''yerba mate'' are found throughout Argentina. In many parts of the country, food is prepared differently and different kinds of foods are made; this includes to a smaller degree food from [[pre-Columbian]] times, as in the Northwest.\n\n=== Central region and la Pampa ===\n[[File:Pizza over Fain\u00e1.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Sliced pizza served over ''[[fain\u00e1]]'', a common combination.]]\n[[File:Puchero argentino servido.JPG|thumb|Argentine [[Puchero]]]]\nFor long periods, urban areas such as [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] welcomed [[Argentines of European descent|European immigrants]], including, above all, those of [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] and [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]] descent. Nevertheless, there was also a migratory flow of [[German Argentine|German]], [[Swiss Argentine|Swiss]], and Middle-Eastern immigrants arriving in Argentina. Among the countless changes this melting pot brought was the enrichment of the culinary art. Dishes such as pasta, pizza, [[puchero]]s ([[stew]]s), [[croqueta]]s ([[fritter]])s, [[sauce]]s, [[embutido]]s ([[sausage]]s), and chicken and meat courses brought a wider scope of options to daily menus. Furthermore, the bread-making, dessert, pastry, and dairy industries have achieved considerable development in this region.\n\nThe above-mentioned dishes have developed a distinctively Argentine nuance. That is why, for example, Argentine pasta includes a wide variety of dishes ranging from [[spaghetti]], fusiles ([[fusilli]]), \u00f1oquis ([[gnocchi]]), [[ravioli]], cintas (pasta ribbons), and [[lasagne]] to the Argentine-made sorrentinos, agnolottis ([[agnolotti]]), canelones ([[cannelloni]]), and fetuchines ([[fettuccine]]).\n\nPizza\u2014made with very thin, and sometimes thick, high-rising [[dough]]s, with or without [[cheese]], cooked in the [[oven]] or ''a la piedra'' (on a [[stone oven]]), and stuffed with numerous ingredients -\u2014 is a dish which can be found in nearly every corner of the  country. [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] also serve it with [[fain\u00e1]], which is a chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza. People say that what makes the Argentine pizza unique is the blending of Italian and Spanish cultures. At the turn of the 19th century, immigrants from [[Naples]] and [[Genoa]] opened the first pizza bars, though Spanish residents subsequently owned most of the pizza businesses.\n\n[[File:Alfajores de Argentina.jpg|thumb|235px|Argentine pastry, including ''Rogel'' (a cake of layers of [[hojaldre]] covered with [[meringue]]), [[dulce de leche]], and regional variants of [[Alfajores]] (from [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]], among others).]]\n\n[[Bread]] products are consumed all around the country. The deeply rooted bread, pastry, and dessert-making tradition derives from blending the above nationalities' products. [[Bakery|Bakeries]] sell not only a wide scope of breads, cookies, and cakes, but also pastries. The latter resembles a sort of roll [[pastry]] whose main dough ingredient is either butter or fat and which may be simple or stuffed with [[dulce de leche]], [[milk]], [[jam]], crema pastelera, or quince or apple jelly, among other fillings. The most popular type of pastry is said to be that of ''medialunas'', based upon [[French cuisine|French]] [[croissant]]s. Furthermore, [[sandwiches de miga]] are another type of bread products; they are made only with thin layers of [[white bread]] (generally referred to as crustless bread) and stuffed with food items ranging from [[ham and cheese]] to other more sophisticated combinations such as raw ham, tomatoes, olives, hard boiled eggs, tuna, lettuce, red pepper, and the like.\n\nDesserts and sweets are usually stuffed or covered with [[dulce de leche]]. The latter can be eaten alone or on top of cakes, [[alfajor]]es, panqueques ([[Cr\u00eape|crepes]]), and pastries, or as a topping spread over [[flan]]. [[Chantilly cream]] is widely consumed and used in preparing sweets and desserts. Additionally, cakes, sponge cakes, and puddings are very popular dishes. [[Italian ice-cream]]s in this region also achieved a significant degree of development by adding local flavors that somehow preserved the local spirit involved in their preparation.\n\nAlthough asado is eaten all over the country, its origin may be traced back to the [[Pampas]]. It entails manifold types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras ([[offal]], or the cow's inner parts), morcilla ([[black pudding|blood sausage]]), and sometimes also a [[provoleta]] (a piece of [[provolone]] cheese cooked on the grill with [[oregano]]) are eaten first. Then comes the [[chorip\u00e1n]] (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as [[short ribs|asado de tira]], vac\u00edo ([[flank steak]]), lomo ([[Beef tenderloin|tenderloin]]), colita de cuadril ([[round steak|rump]]), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entra\u00f1a ([[hanger steak]]); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as ''cabrito al asador'' (roast kid or goat) in the [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|province of C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\n=== Northwest and Cuyo ===\n[[File:Locro.jpg|thumb|left|210px|A bowl of ''[[Locro]]'' stew, a traditional standby in northwestern Argentina.]]\n\nThis region is regarded as perhaps the one most influenced by Native Americans, and its foods are closely linked to the Andean-Incan tradition. When preparing regional dishes, [[potato]]es and [[corn]] or wheat are almost always used, including [[quinoa]] (a cereal typically used in Incan cuisine), [[Bell pepper|peppers]], [[Squash (plant)|squashes]] and [[tomato]]es. The most celebrated dishes are [[humita]] and [[Tamale|tamal]], in which the corn husk is stuffed with the corn filling itself, seasonings or meat.\n \nThis region is the most suitable to taste [[empanada]]s, particularly those stuffed with meat and offering different types of tempting varieties such as the ''meat empanada'', salte\u00f1a also filled with potatoes, or the ''empanada tucumana'', which is stuffed with matambre and cut with a knife, or empanadas made with cheese. Empanadas are individual sized and closed savoury pastries which may be fried or baked in the oven and are generally eaten with the hands.\n\nStews such as [[locro]], carbonada, [[pollo al disco]], and [[cazuela]]s (casseroles) are also typical dishes characterizing this region, which also include pumpkin or potato pudding stuffed with meat.\n\n=== Mesopotamia ===\n[[File:Kaa mate.JPG|thumb|210px|[[Mate (beverage)|Mate]], the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|northeastern region]]'s best-known contribution to Argentine cuisine.]]\n\nThe humid and verdant area of north-east Argentina known as [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]], comprising the provinces of Corrientes, Misiones and Entre R\u00edos is another area influenced by Native Americans, particularly by the [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed tribe]]. Abounding in rivers and shores, it offers a wide diversity of fish species, such as dorado, [[Piaractus mesopotamicus|pac\u00fa]], [[Pseudoplatystoma|surubi]], [[Leporinus obtusidens|boga]] and [[Atheriniformes|silverside]].\n\nWidely grown in this area, [[cassava]] is typically included in the region's dishes, as are other components of meals, such as the [[chip\u00e1]] (a cassava and cheese bread). However, in this area Cassava is cooked alone too, boiled or fried, often as a side dish for asado and empanadas. Sopa Paraguaya and Chip\u00e1 Guazu (also called Tarta de Choclo) are also commonly eaten and are made with corn. [[Chip\u00e1]] from Cassava is often eaten during breakfast with yerba mate, prepared with hot water, or with [[caf\u00e9 con leche]]. Sopa Paraguaya and Tarta de Choclo are eaten for lunch or dinner. As regards to products made with sugar, [[Papaya]] (mam\u00f3n in Argentine Spanish) [[jam]] is typical of the [[Corrientes Province|province of Corrientes]].\n\nThe principal product of this region is certainly [[yerba mate]]. Consumed countrywide, this product features a peculiarity of its own in this area: it is not only prepared with hot water, but, driven by the region's high temperatures, it is common to see it prepared with cold water as well, in which case the beverage is known as [[terer\u00e9]].\n\n=== Patagonia ===\nFoods produced in the large southern region of [[Patagonia]] include [[fish]] and [[seafood]] from the sea and rivers, and the products of the [[sheep]] widely farmed there.\n\nMarine species such as [[Salmon (food)|salmon]], [[Lithodes santolla|spider crab]]s, [[Squid (food)|squid]] and other [[shellfish]] and [[mollusc]]s may be caught in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. There are [[trout]] in the rivers.\n\n[[File:Tortas en San Mart\u00edn de los Andes.JPG|thumb|210px|''Chocolate y [[dulce de leche]]'' cakes and other regional favorites in a [[San Mart\u00edn de los Andes]], [[Neuquen Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]] shop.]]\nThe many berries grown in the area include [[Cherry|cherries]], [[Bilberry|bilberries]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Rosa rubiginosa|rosa mosqueta]] and elders, which are made into [[jam]]s.\n\nThe [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Central Europe]]an settlements in this region have built up large-scale production of [[chocolate]] and its by-products. Viennese and German cuisine and pastries are also typically associated with this region.\n\nMutton and lamb, together with wild boar and venison tend to make up the region's meat-based dishes. Also typical of  southern region are smoked products, including salmon, stag, wild boar, and pheasant.\n\nPatagonia has been profoundly influenced by the tribes living there since long before Europeans arrived, in particular, the [[Mapuche]]s and the [[Araucano]]s. A typical dish prepared by the latter is the [[curanto]] (a term meaning \"hot stone\"). Its preparation involves making a fire in a hole about 150&nbsp;cm deep in the ground, and heating stones in it. A bed of nalca or maqui leaves is arranged on top of the stones, and ingredients are added in turn on top. Ingredients vary, but may include beef, lamb, pork, chicken, [[Chorizo#South America|Argentine chorizos]] (pork sausages), potatoes, sweet potatoes, apples and holed squashes filled with cheese, cream and peas. The food is covered with leaves and damp pieces of cloth to keep the heat in, and covered with plenty of soil.\n\n== Alcoholic beverages ==\n{{See also|Argentine wine}}\n{{Double image|right|Vino argentino.jpg|170|Vino argentino blanco premium.jpg|157|Glasses of Argentine red (left) and white (right) wine.|||}}\n\nThough [[wine]] (''vino'') has traditionally been the most popular alcoholic beverage in Argentina, beer (''cerveza''; the Italian ''birra'' is frequently used) in recent decades has competed with wine in popularity. Breweries appeared in Argentina at the end of the 1860s, started by [[Alsace|Alsatian]] colonists. The first were nearly all in the downtown of Buenos Aires (''el \u00e9gido de la Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires''), and soon [[Poland|Polish]] brewers began industrial production of beer: San Carlos in the province of Santa Fe, [[R\u00edo Segundo, C\u00f3rdoba|R\u00edo Segundo]] and C\u00f3rdoba in the province of C\u00f3rdoba, [[Cerveza Quilmes|Quilmes]] and [[Llavallol]] on the outskirts of [[La Plata]] (in Buenos Aires Province), [[San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n]] in the province of Tucum\u00e1n and on the outskirts of the cities of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Salta]].\n\nThe local consumption of beer has risen dramatically in the last generation: Argentines consumed 233 million liters in 1980 and 1.57 billion in 2007 (40 liters per capita).<ref>{{Cite web\n |url          = http://www.mecon.gov.ar/peconomica/basehome/infoeco.html\n |title        = Programaci\u00f3n Macroecon\u00f3mica\n |website      = Mecon.gov.ar\n |access-date  = 2016-02-26\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061254/http://www.mecon.gov.ar/peconomica/basehome/infoeco.html\n |archive-date = 2015-05-25\n |dead-url     = yes\n |df           = \n}}</ref> Outpacing that of wine since 2001, the growing production and consumption of beer has supported the existence of related events, for example beer festivals called ''[[Oktoberfest]]s'' or \"''Fiestas de la Cerveza''\" in locations that have a significant [[Germans|German]] population ([[Villa General Belgrano]] in C\u00f3rdoba, [[San Carlos, Santa Fe|San Carlos]] and [[Esperanza, Santa Fe|Esperanza]] in the province of Santa Fe, etc.). Such celebrations copy, in an Argentine manner, [[Munich]]'s ''Oktoberfest'', and similarly are tourist attractions. However, the presence of a vigorous population of [[Celt]]ic lineage, principally of Irish origin, has supported the creation of other celebrations of beer, often for marketing purposes, such as [[Saint Patrick's Day]] (''D\u00eda de San Patricio''), patron of Ireland, which is celebrated with abundant libations.\n\nThe consumption of alcoholic beverages in Argentina is similar to that of the United States and somewhat lower than the Western European average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_2004_overview.pdf|format=PDF|title=Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004|website=Who.int|accessdate=2017-08-02}}</ref> Argentines enjoy a variety of alcoholic beverages and Argentina can boast a varied array of ''elaboraciones'', whether industrial or [[artisanal]]. Besides beer and wine, Argentines frequently drink [[cider]] (here again, the heritage comes from Spain and Italy, more precisely from [[Asturias]] and [[Campania]]). Cider is the most popular beverage of the middle and lower economic classes at Christmas and [[New Year]] (the upper classes proverbially preferring to celebrate with locally produced [[champagne]], although real old-line \"[[Creole peoples|creole]]\" aristocrats will still drink cider, which is much more traditional).\n\nOther widely consumed spirits are ''[[aguardiente]]'' (firewater) made from [[sugar cane]], known as ''ca\u00f1a quemada'' (\"burnt cane\") or, simply, ''''ca\u00f1a'''' (\"cane\").<ref>Although \"ca\u00f1a\" in this sense is really derived from \"[[cognac]]\" and the term was traditionally used in old Argentina for any [[brandy]], but especially for peach brandy, ''ca\u00f1a de durazno''.</ref> A folkloric note about ''ca\u00f1a quemada'': until June 21 it is traditional to drink ''ca\u00f1a quemada'' with ''ruda macho'' (a variant of [[common rue]]), it is supposed that this mixture prevents the [[flu]] and other illnesses. ''Ca\u00f1a'' competes, mainly in rural areas, with [[gin]] (\"ginebra\"\u2014as in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] kind of gin.)\n\nThere are many artisanally produced [[liqueur]]s (distilled, flavored [[alcoholic beverage]]s) in Argentina, for example those flavored with [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[egg (food)|egg]], [[anise]], coffee, cherry and, inevitably, ''dulce de leche''. The ''[[Hesperidina]]'' is a type of liqueur made from orange peels, invented in Argentina around 1890. One may also encounter ''chitronchelo'' or (in Italian) ''[[citroncello]]'', based on lemon. This beverage arrived with immigrants from the [[Mezzogiorno]], and is produced both artisanally and industrially (for example, at [[Mar del Plata]]).\n\n== Non-alcoholic specialties ==\n[[File:Tortoni 3 008.jpg|thumb|[[Caf\u00e9 Tortoni]], one of the many [[coffehouse]]s in [[Buenos Aires]].

Among these, ''mate'' has long been the most widely enjoyed; in 2006, over 700,000 metric tons were harvested in Argentina, mostly for domestic consumption.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.indec.mecon.ar/ \n |title=INDEC: Instituto nacional de estadistica y censos de la Republica Argentina \n |website=Indec.mecon.ar \n |access-date=2016-02-26 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221215704/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/ \n |archivedate=2016-02-21 \n}}</ref>\n\nThe fact that mate is so prevalent in the ''[[Southern Cone]]'', however, should not necessarily make visitors think that other infusions are rare in the region; in Argentina especially, given the strong European cultural imprint, the consumption of coffee is very common (141 cups per capita, annually).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Chocolate [[infusion]]s are also popular (the eating of chocolate is a Spanish influence, although the plant originated in [[Mesoamerica]]). This consumption grows during autumn and winter, or in the cold regions of the country; there are two dates where consumption of chocolate infusions is traditional in the primary educational centres: 25 May and 9 July, that is, the two national dates of Argentina.\n\nEnglish cultural influence (reinforced at the end of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th by British contacts with the [[Far East]]) has also made the consumption of [[tea]] very common.\n\n[[Medicinal herb]]s are common in the whole country; among the most popular are: [[chamomile]], [[Salvia reflexa|lanceleaf]], ''[[boldo]]'', ''poleo'', ''[[peperina]]'', ''carqueja'', [[thyme]], ''canchalagua'', [[rue]] (''macho'' and ''hembra'', that is, \"male\" and \"female\"), [[Malva|mallow]], [[rosemary]], [[passion flower]], ''bira bira'', ''pal\u00e1n pal\u00e1n'', ''[[Minthostachys mollis|mu\u00f1a mu\u00f1a]]'', to mention only the main ones. Many of these herbs are also used in [[ap\u00e9ritif]]s and [[bitter (taste)|bitter]]s, whether alcoholic or not.\n\n== Popular short-order dishes ==\n[[File:BarBritanico.JPG|thumb|210px|''Bar Brit\u00e1nico'', Buenos Aires. These \"bars\" are typically more akin to [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] \"[[pub]]s\" and are popular at lunchtime.]]\nCommon ''restoranes'' or ''[[restaurant]]es'' and ''rotiserias'' (grill restaurants) nearly anywhere in Argentina today serve (into the small hours) quickly prepared meals that in the course of the 20th century came to be known as ''minutas'', \"short-order dishes.\" Some of the dishes included in the category of ''minutas'' are ''[[milanesa]]s'', ''churrascos'', ''bifes'' ([[beefsteak]]s), ''[[escalopes]]'', ''[[tallarines]]'', ''ravioles'' ([[ravioli]]), ''\u00f1oquis'' ([[gnocchi]]), although some are very typical of locations that sell food: \"''bifes''\" and \"''milanesas''\" are served \"''a caballo''\" (\"on horseback\", with [[fried egg]] on top), \"''milanesa completa''\" (a ''milanesa'' with two fried eggs and [[French fries]]), \"''revuelto Gramajo''\", \"''colch\u00f3n de arvejas''\" (an omelette made with peas), \"''suprema de pollo''\" (chicken [[Supreme (cookery)|supreme]], usually breaded as a ''milanesa''), ''[[matambre]]s'', \"''lengua a la vinagreta''\" ([[Pickling|pickled]] [[Tongue (foodstuff)|tongue]]), and \"[[sandwich]]es\" (sandwiches de miga) are made with sliced white bread, rather than, say, rolls.\n\nThe most common sandwiches are those made of ''milanesa'', baked ham and cheese, 'pan de miga'', [[toast]], ''[[pebete]]s'', ''panchos'' (hot dogs), ''[[choripan]]es'', ''morcipanes'', etc.; from [[Montevideo]] comes a different species of sandwich called the ''[[chivito (sandwich)|chivito]]'', even though it contains no goat meat.\n\n''[[Picada (Argentina)|Picadas]]'', which are consumed at home or in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[caf\u00e9]]s, \"''cafetines''\" and \"''[[bodegones]]''\" are also popular; they consist of an ensemble of plates containing cubes of cheese (typically from [[Mar del Plata]] or [[Chubut Province|Chubut]]), pieces of [[salame]], [[olive]]s in [[brine]], french fries, ''man\u00edes'' ([[peanut]]s), etc.; ''[[picada]]''s are eaten accompanied by an alcoholic beverage (\"''[[fernet]]''\", beer, wine with [[Carbonated water|soda]], to give some common examples).\n\nThe people of Argentina greatly enjoy ''helado'' ([[ice cream]]s of Italian lineage  or [[sorbet]]s Spanish lineage).

In most parts of Argentina, lunch is the largest meal of the day. Excluding the largest cities, such as Buenos Aires, most towns close for lunch time.

In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a ''tu quoque'' response is that Source A has acted in the same way. This argument is invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a [[hypocrite]], but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.\n\nFor example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.\n\n===Circumstantial===\n{{Main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).<ref name=\"Walton (1998) p18-21\">{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Ad Hominem Arguments |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8173-0922-5 |pages=18\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.<ref name=\"Fallacy Files\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n'''Examples''':\n\n# [[Mandy Rice-Davies]]'s famous testimony during the [[Profumo Affair]], \"He would [say that], wouldn't he?\", is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a [[callgirl]], would deny the claim whether it was true or false.  His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair.\n\nHowever, this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does ''not'' strengthen the original claim.  To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of ''argumentum ad hominem'' and ''appeal to emotions''); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is even more likely to deny an affair that never happened.

Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?\"\n\n== Non-fallacious reasoning ==\nWhen a statement is challenged by making an ''ad hominem'' attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was ''an argument'' or ''a statement of fact'' (''testimony''). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.<ref name=\"Fallacy Files\"/>\n\n== Criticism as a fallacy ==\n\n[[Doug Walton]],  Canadian academic and author, has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,<ref>{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=170}}</ref> as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Taylor

The analysis of the former and the latter algorithm shows that it takes at most log<sub>2</sub>(''n'') and ''n'' check steps, respectively, for a list of length ''n''. In the depicted example list of length 33, searching for ''\"Morin, Arthur\"'' takes 5 and 28 steps with binary (shown in {{color|#008080|cyan}}) and linear ({{color|#800080|magenta}}) search, respectively.]]\n{{comparison computational complexity.svg|N=}}\nIn [[computer science]], the '''analysis of algorithms''' is the determination of the [[computational complexity]] of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to [[computation|execute them]]. Usually, this involves determining a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its [[time complexity]]) or the number of storage locations it uses (its [[space complexity]]). An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same length may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so [[best, worst and average case]] descriptions might all be of practical interest.  When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an [[upper bound]], determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm.\n\nThe term \"analysis of algorithms\" was coined by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160828152021/http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/news.html Donald Knuth, Recent News]</ref> Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader [[computational complexity theory]], which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given [[computational problem]]. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient algorithms]].\n\nIn theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. [[Big O notation]], [[Big-omega notation]] and [[Big-theta notation]] are used to this end. For instance, [[binary search]] is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially \"in [[logarithmic time]]\". Usually [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] estimates are used because different [[implementation]]s of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency. However the efficiencies of any two \"reasonable\" implementations of a given algorithm are related by a constant multiplicative factor  called a ''hidden constant''.\n\nExact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called [[model of computation]]. A model of computation may be defined in terms of an [[abstract machine|abstract computer]], e.g., [[Turing machine]], and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.\nFor example, if the sorted list to which we apply binary search has ''n'' elements, and we can guarantee that each lookup of an element in the list can be done in unit time, then at most log<sub>2</sub> ''n'' + 1 time units are needed to return an answer.\n<!-- Exact measures of efficiency are useful to the people who actually implement and use algorithms, because they are more precise and thus enable them to know how much time they can expect to spend in execution. To some people (e.g. game programmers), a hidden constant can make all the difference between success and failure.-->\n\n== Cost models ==\nTime efficiency estimates depend on what we define to be a step. For the analysis to correspond usefully to the actual execution time, the time required to perform a step must be guaranteed to be bounded above by a constant. One must be careful here; for instance, some analyses count an addition of two numbers as one step. This assumption may not be warranted in certain contexts. For example, if the numbers involved in a computation may be arbitrarily large, the time required by a single addition can no longer be assumed to be constant.\n\nTwo cost models are generally used:<ref name=\"AhoHopcroft1974\">{{cite book|author1=Alfred V.

Run-time efficiency is a topic of great interest in [[computer science]]:  A [[Computer program|program]] can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on which algorithm it implements. While [[software profiling]] techniques can be used to measure an algorithm's run-time in practice, they cannot provide timing data for all infinitely many possible inputs; the latter can only be achieved by the theoretical methods of run-time analysis.\n\n===Shortcomings of empirical metrics===\n\nSince algorithms are [[platform-independent]] (i.e. a given algorithm can be implemented in an arbitrary [[programming language]] on an arbitrary [[computer]] running an arbitrary [[operating system]]), there are additional significant drawbacks to using an [[empirical]] approach to gauge the comparative performance of a given set of algorithms.\n\nTake as an example a program that looks up a specific entry in a [[collation|sorted]] [[list (computing)|list]] of size ''n''.  Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A, a state-of-the-art machine, using a [[linear search]] algorithm, and on Computer B, a much slower machine, using a [[binary search algorithm]].  [[benchmark (computing)|Benchmark testing]] on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''n'' (list size)\n! Computer A run-time<br />(in [[nanosecond]]s)\n! Computer B run-time<br />(in [[nanosecond]]s)\n|-\n| 16\n| 8 \n| 100,000 \n|-\n| 63\n| 32 \n| 150,000 \n|-\n| 250\n| 125 \n| 200,000 \n|-\n| 1,000\n| 500 \n| 250,000 \n|}\n\nBased on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that ''Computer A'' is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of ''Computer B''.  However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''n'' (list size)\n! Computer A run-time<br />(in [[nanosecond]]s)\n! Computer B run-time<br />(in [[nanosecond]]s)\n|-\n| 16\n| 8 \n| 100,000 \n|-\n| 63\n| 32 \n| 150,000 \n|-\n| 250\n| 125 \n| 200,000 \n|-\n| 1,000\n| 500 \n| 250,000 \n|-\n| ...\n| ...\n| ...\n|-\n| 1,000,000\n| 500,000\n| 500,000\n|-\n| 4,000,000\n| 2,000,000\n| 550,000\n|-\n| 16,000,000\n| 8,000,000\n| 600,000\n|-\n| ...\n| ...\n| ...\n|-\n| 63,072 &times; 10<sup>12</sup>\n| 31,536 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> ns,<br />or 1 year\n| 1,375,000 ns,<br />or 1.375 milliseconds\n|}\n\nComputer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a [[linear]] growth rate.  The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size.  Doubling the input size doubles the run time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth.  On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a [[logarithm]]ic growth rate.  Quadrupling the input size only increases the run time by a [[wiktionary:Constant|constant]] amount (in this example, 50,000 ns).  Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it's running an algorithm with a much slower growth rate.\n\n===Orders of growth===\n{{main|Big O notation}}\nInformally, an algorithm can be said to exhibit a growth rate on the order of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] if beyond a certain input size ''n'', the function {{tmath|f(n)}} times a positive constant provides an [[Asymptotic analysis|upper bound or limit]] for the run-time of that algorithm.  In other words, for a given input size ''n'' greater than some ''n''<sub>0</sub> and a constant ''c'', the running time of that algorithm will never be larger than {{tmath|c \\times f(n)}}.  This concept is frequently expressed using Big O notation.  For example, since the run-time of [[insertion sort]] [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] as its input size increases, insertion sort can be said to be of order ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nBig O notation is a convenient way to express the [[Best, worst and average case|worst-case scenario]] for a given algorithm, although it can also be used to express the average-case &mdash; for example, the worst-case scenario for [[quicksort]] is ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), but the average-case run-time is {{math|''O''(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'')}}.\n\n===Empirical orders of growth===\n\nAssuming the execution time follows power rule, ''{{math|t &asymp; k n<sup>a</sup>}}'', the coefficient ''a'' can be found <ref>[http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/how-to-avoid-o-abuse-and-bribes/ How To Avoid O-Abuse and Bribes], at the blog \"G\u00f6del\u2019s Lost Letter and P=NP\" by R. J. Lipton, professor of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, recounting idea by Robert Sedgewick</ref> by taking empirical measurements of run time <math>\\{t_1, t_2\\}</math> at some problem-size points <math>\\{n_1, n_2\\}</math>, and calculating <math>t_2/t_1 = (n_2/n_1)^a</math> so that <math>a = \\log(t_2/t_1) / \\log(n_2/n_1)</math>. In other words, this measures the slope of the empirical line on the [[log\u2013log plot]] of execution time vs. problem size, at some size point. If the order of growth indeed follows the power rule (and so the line on log\u2013log plot is indeed a straight line), the empirical value of ''a'' will  stay constant at different ranges, and if not, it will change (and the line is a curved line) - but still could serve for comparison of any two given algorithms as to their ''empirical local orders of growth'' behaviour. Applied to the above table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-_\n! ''n'' (list size)\n! Computer A run-time<br />(in [[nanosecond]]s)\n! Local order of growth<br />(n^_)\n! Computer B run-time<br />(in [[nanosecond]]s)\n! Local order of growth<br />(n^_)\n|-\n| 15\n| 7 \n| \n| 100,000 \n| \n|-\n| 65\n| 32 \n| 1.04\n| 150,000 \n| 0.28\n|-\n| 250\n| 125 \n| 1.01\n| 200,000 \n| 0.21\n|-\n| 1,000\n| 500 \n| 1.00\n| 250,000 \n| 0.16\n|-\n| ...\n| ...\n| \n| ...\n| \n|-\n| 1,000,000\n| 500,000\n| 1.00\n| 500,000\n| 0.10\n|-\n| 4,000,000\n| 2,000,000\n| 1.00\n| 550,000\n| 0.07\n|-\n| 16,000,000\n| 8,000,000\n| 1.00\n| 600,000\n| 0.06\n|-\n| ...\n| ...\n| \n| ...\n| \n|}\n\nIt is clearly seen that the first algorithm exhibits a linear order of growth indeed following the power rule. The empirical values for the second one are diminishing rapidly, suggesting it follows another rule of growth and in any case has much lower local orders of growth (and improving further still), empirically, than the first one.\n\n=== Evaluating run-time complexity ===\nThe run-time complexity for the worst-case scenario of a given algorithm can sometimes be evaluated by examining the structure of the algorithm and making some simplifying assumptions.  Consider the following [[pseudocode]]:\n\n 1    ''get a positive integer from input''\n 2    '''if''' n > 10\n 3        '''print''' \"This might take a while...\"\n 4    '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' n\n 5        '''for''' j = 1 '''to''' i\n 6            '''print''' i * j\n 7    '''print''' \"Done!\"\n\nA given computer will take a [[DTIME|discrete amount of time]] to execute each of the [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] involved with carrying out this algorithm.  The specific amount of time to carry out a given instruction will vary depending on which instruction is being executed and which computer is executing it, but on a conventional computer, this amount will be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]].<ref>However, this is not the case with a [[quantum computer]]</ref>  Say that the actions carried out in step 1 are considered to consume time ''T''<sub>1</sub>, step 2 uses time ''T''<sub>2</sub>, and so forth.\n\nIn the algorithm above, steps 1, 2 and 7 will only be run once.  For a worst-case evaluation, it should be assumed that step 3 will be run as well.  Thus the total amount of time to run steps 1-3 and step 7 is:\n\n:<math>T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7. \\,</math>\n\nThe [[program loop|loops]] in steps 4, 5 and 6 are trickier to evaluate.  The outer loop test in step 4 will execute ( ''n'' + 1 )\ntimes (note that an extra step is required to terminate the for loop, hence n + 1 and not n executions), which will consume ''T''<sub>4</sub>( ''n'' + 1 ) time.  The inner loop, on the other hand, is governed by the value of j, which [[iteration|iterates]] from 1 to ''i''.  On the first pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 1:  The inner loop makes one pass, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes ''T''<sub>6</sub> time, and the inner loop test (step 5) consumes 2''T''<sub>5</sub> time.  During the next pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 2:  the inner loop makes two passes, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes 2''T''<sub>6</sub> time, and the inner loop test (step 5) consumes 3''T''<sub>5</sub> time.\n\nAltogether, the total time required to run the inner loop body can be expressed as an [[arithmetic progression]]:\n\n:<math>T_6 + 2T_6 + 3T_6 + \\cdots + (n-1) T_6 + n T_6</math>\n\nwhich can be [[factorization|factored]]<ref>It can be proven by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] that <math>1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + (n-1) + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</math></ref> as\n\n:<math>T_6 \\left[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + (n-1) + n \\right] = T_6 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] </math>\n\nThe total time required to run the outer loop test can be evaluated similarly:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& 2T_5 + 3T_5 + 4T_5 + \\cdots + (n-1) T_5 + n T_5 + (n + 1) T_5\\\\\n=\\ &T_5 + 2T_5 + 3T_5 + 4T_5 + \\cdots + (n-1)T_5 + nT_5 + (n+1)T_5 - T_5\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich can be factored as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& T_5 \\left[ 1+2+3+\\cdots + (n-1) + n + (n + 1) \\right] - T_5 \\\\\n=& \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right]  T_5 +  (n + 1)T_5 - T_5 \\\\\n=& T_5 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] + n T_5 \\\\\n=& \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \\right] T_5\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, the total running time for this algorithm is:\n\n:<math>f(n) = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 + (n + 1)T_4 + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] T_6 + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2+3n) \\right] T_5 </math>\n\nwhich [[reduction (mathematics)|reduces]] to\n\n:<math>f(n) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] T_6 + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \\right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7\n</math>\n\nAs a [[rule-of-thumb]], one can assume that the highest-order term in any given function dominates its rate of growth and thus defines its run-time order.  In this example, n<sup>2</sup> is the highest-order term, so one can conclude that f(n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>).  Formally this can be proven as follows:\n<blockquote>Prove that <math>\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] T_6 + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \\right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \\le cn^2,\\ n \\ge n_0</math>\n<br /><br />\n<math>\\begin{align}\n&\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] T_6 + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \\right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7\\\\\n\\le &( n^2 + n )T_6 + ( n^2 + 3n )T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \\ (\\text{for } n \\ge 0 )\n\\end{align}</math>\n<br /><br />\nLet ''k'' be a constant greater than or equal to [''T''<sub>1</sub>..''T''<sub>7</sub>]\n<br /><br />\n<math>\\begin{align}\n&T_6( n^2 + n ) + T_5( n^2 + 3n ) + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \\le k( n^2 + n ) + k( n^2 + 3n ) + kn + 5k\\\\\n= &2kn^2 + 5kn + 5k \\le 2kn^2 + 5kn^2 + 5kn^2 \\ (\\text{for } n \\ge 1) = 12kn^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n<br /><br />\nTherefore <math>\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \\right] T_6 + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \\right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \\le cn^2, n \\ge n_0 \\text{ for } c = 12k, n_0 = 1</math>\n</blockquote>\n\nA more [[elegance|elegant]] approach to analyzing this algorithm would be to declare that [''T''<sub>1</sub>..''T''<sub>7</sub>] are all equal to one unit of time, in a system of units chosen so that one unit is greater than or equal to the actual times for these steps.  This would mean that the algorithm's running time breaks down as follows:<ref>This approach, unlike the above approach, neglects the constant time consumed by the loop tests which terminate their respective loops, but it is [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] to prove that such omission does not affect the final result</ref>\n<blockquote><math>4+\\sum_{i=1}^n i\\leq 4+\\sum_{i=1}^n n=4+n^2\\leq5n^2 \\ (\\text{for } n \\ge 1) =O(n^2).</math></blockquote>\n\n===Growth rate analysis of other resources===\nThe methodology of run-time analysis can also be utilized for predicting other growth rates, such as consumption of [[DSPACE|memory space]].  As an example, consider the following pseudocode which manages and reallocates memory usage by a program based on the size of a [[computer file|file]] which that program manages:\n\n '''while''' (''file still open'')\n     '''let''' n = ''size of file''\n     '''for''' ''every 100,000 [[kilobyte]]s of increase in file size''\n         ''double the amount of memory reserved''\n\nIn this instance, as the file size n increases, memory will be consumed at an [[exponential growth]] rate, which is order O(2<sup>n</sup>). This is an extremely rapid and most likely unmanageable growth rate for consumption of memory [[Resource (computer science)|resources]].\n\n==Relevance==\nAlgorithm analysis is important in practice because the accidental or unintentional use of an inefficient algorithm can significantly impact system performance. In time-sensitive applications, an algorithm taking too long to run can render its results outdated or useless. An inefficient algorithm can also end up requiring an uneconomical amount of computing power or storage in order to run, again rendering it practically useless.\n\n==Constant factors==\nAnalysis of algorithms typically focuses on the asymptotic performance, particularly at the elementary level, but in practical applications constant factors are important, and real-world data is in practice always limited in size. The limit is typically the size of addressable memory, so on 32-bit machines 2<sup>32</sup> = 4 GiB (greater if [[segmented memory]] is used) and on 64-bit machines 2<sup>64</sup> = 16 EiB. Thus given a limited size, an order of growth (time or space) can be replaced by a constant factor, and in this sense all practical algorithms are O(1) for a large enough constant, or for small enough data.\n\nThis interpretation is primarily useful for functions that grow extremely slowly: (binary) [[iterated logarithm]] (log<sup>*</sup>) is less than 5 for all practical data (2<sup>65536</sup> bits); (binary) log-log (log log ''n'') is less than 6 for virtually all practical data (2<sup>64</sup> bits); and binary log (log ''n'') is less than 64 for virtually all practical data (2<sup>64</sup> bits). An algorithm with non-constant complexity may nonetheless be more efficient than an algorithm with constant complexity on practical data if the overhead of the constant time algorithm results in a larger constant factor, e.g., one may have <math>K > k \\log \\log n</math> so long as <math>K/k > 6</math> and <math>n < 2^{2^6} = 2^{64}</math>.\n\nFor large data linear or quadratic factors cannot be ignored, but for small data an asymptotically inefficient algorithm may be more efficient. This is particularly used in [[hybrid algorithm]]s, like [[Timsort]], which use an asymptotically efficient algorithm (here [[merge sort]], with time complexity <math>n \\log n</math>), but switch to an asymptotically inefficient algorithm (here [[insertion sort]], with time complexity <math>n^2</math>) for small data, as the simpler algorithm is faster on small data.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amortized analysis]]\n* [[Analysis of parallel algorithms]]\n* [[Asymptotic computational complexity]]\n* [[Best, worst and average case]]\n* [[Big O notation]]\n* [[Computational complexity theory]]\n* [[Master theorem (analysis of algorithms)]]\n* [[NP-Complete]]\n* [[Numerical analysis]]\n* [[Polynomial time]]\n* [[Program optimization]]\n* [[Profiling (computer programming)]]\n* [[Scalability]]\n* [[Smoothed analysis]]\n* [[Termination analysis]] &mdash; the subproblem of checking whether a program will terminate at all\n* [[Time complexity]] \u2014 includes table of orders of growth for common algorithms\n* [[Information-based complexity]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |authorlink=Thomas H.

Amongst the enemies of Roman Britain were the [[Pict]]s of central and northern [[Scotland]], and the [[Gaels]] known as [[Scoti]], who were raiders from [[Ireland]]. Also vexatious were the [[Saxons]], the name Roman writers gave to the peoples who lived in the northern part of what is now Germany and the southern part of the [[Jutland]] peninsula. Saxon raids on the southern and eastern shores of England had been sufficiently alarming by the late 3rd century for the Romans to build the [[Saxon Shore Forts|Saxon Shore forts]], and subsequently to establish the role of the [[Count of the Saxon Shore]] to command the defence against these incursions. Roman control of Britain finally ended in the early part of the 5th century; the date usually given as marking the end of Roman Britain is 410, when the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] sent letters to the British, urging them to look to their own defence.  Britain had been repeatedly stripped of troops to support usurpers' claims to the Roman empire, and after 410 the Roman armies never returned.<ref name=Blair_IASE_1>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', pp. 1\u201314.</ref><ref name=Campbell_TAS_13>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nSources for events after this date are extremely scarce, but a tradition, reported as early as the mid-6th century by a British priest named [[Gildas]], records that the British sent for help against the barbarians to [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], a Roman [[consul]], probably in the late 440s. No help came. Subsequently, a British leader named [[Vortigern]] is supposed to have invited continental mercenaries to help fight the Picts who were attacking from the north. The leaders, whose names are recorded as [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], rebelled, and a long period of warfare ensued.  The invaders\u2014[[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], and [[Frisii|Frisians]]\u2014gained control of parts of England, but lost a major battle at [[Mons Badonicus]] (the location of which is not known).

The earliest is ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|The Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', a history of the English church written in 731 by [[Bede]], a [[Northumbria]]n monk. Bede mentions \u00c6lle as one of the Anglo-Saxon kings who exercised what he calls \"imperium\" over \"all the provinces south of the river [[Humber]]\"; \"imperium\" is usually translated as \"overlordship\". Bede gives a list of seven kings who held \"imperium\", and \u00c6lle is the first of them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=tZkzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT793&lpg=PT793&dq=%C3%86thelwealh+king+of+sussex&source=bl&ots=coit1b2NWo&sig=YraF2mu2C1bHFOEpLV7SPf4NuY0&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%C3%86thelwealh%20king%20of%20sussex&f=false|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England|last=Lapidge|first=Michael|last2=Blair|first2=John|last3=Keynes|first3=Simon|last4=Scragg|first4=Donald|date=2013-10-02|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118316108|language=en}}</ref> The other information Bede gives is that \u00c6lle was not a Christian\u2014Bede mentions a later king as \"the first to enter the kingdom of heaven\".<ref name=Bede_111 />\n\nThe second source is the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', a collection of annals assembled in the Kingdom of [[Wessex]] in c. 890, during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]]. The ''Chronicle'' has three entries for \u00c6lle, from 477 to 491, as follows:<ref name=Swanton_14>Translations are [[Michael Swanton]]'s (''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 14), from the A text of the ''Chronicle''; except that Frank M. Stenton's translation (''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 17\u201318) of part has been substituted to keep \"Andredes leag\" and \"Andredes cester\" in the text, for subsequent explanation.</ref>\n\n*477: \u00c6lle and his 3 sons, Cymen and Wlencing and Cissa, came to the land of Britain with 3 ships at the place which is named [[Cymen's shore]], and there killed many Welsh and drove some to flight into the wood called Andredes leag.\n*485: Here \u00c6lle fought against the Welsh near the margin of Mearcred's Burn.\n*491: Here \u00c6lle and Cissa besieged Andredes cester, and killed all who lived in there; there was not even one Briton left there.\n\nThe ''Chronicle'' was put together about four hundred years after these events. It is known that the annalists used material from earlier chronicles, as well as from oral sources such as sagas, but there is no way to tell where these lines came from.<ref name=Swanton_xviii>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xviii\u2013xix</ref>  It should also be noted that the terms 'British' and 'Welsh' were used interchangeably, as 'Welsh' is the Saxon word meaning 'foreigner', and was applied to all the native Romano-British of the era.<ref name=Swanton_14_2>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 14.</ref>\n\nThree of the places named may be identified :\n#\"[[Cymen's shore]]\" (\"Cymenes ora\" in the original) is believed to be located at what is now a series of rocks and ledges, in the English Channel off  [[Selsey Bill]], on the south coast, known as the Owers.<ref name=\"ngia4\">NIMA.Pub194.

Gildas's description of the state of Britain in his time is useful for understanding the ebb and flow of the Anglo-Saxon incursions. [[Procopius]], a [[Byzantine]] historian, writing not long after Gildas, adds to the meagre sources on population movement by including a chapter on England in one of his works.  He records that the peoples of Britain\u2014he names the English, the British, and the Frisians\u2014were so numerous that they were migrating to the kingdom of the Franks in great numbers every year.<ref name=Blair_RBaEE_164>Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 164.</ref> Although this is probably a reference to Britons emigrating to [[Armorica]] to escape the Anglo-Saxons. They subsequently gave their name to the area they settled as [[Brittany]], or ''la petite Bretagne'' (literally little Britain).\n\n==Evidence from place names in Sussex==\nThe early dates given in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the colonization of Sussex are supported by an analysis of the place names of the region. The strongest evidence comes from place names that end in \"-ing\", such as [[Worthing]] and [[Angmering]]. These are known to derive from an earlier form ending in \"-ingas\". \"[[Hastings]]\" for example, derives from \"H\u00e6stingas\" which may mean \"the followers or dependents of a person named H\u00e6sta\", although others suggest the heavily Romanised region may have had names of Gallo-Roman origin derived from \"-ienses\".<ref name=BlairRBaEE_176_2>Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\nFrom west of Selsey Bill to east of Pevensey can be found the densest concentration of these names anywhere in Britain. There are a total of about forty-five place names in Sussex of this form, however, personal names either were not associated with these places or fell out of use.  This does not necessarily mean that the Saxons killed or drove out almost all of the native population, despite the slaughter of the Britons reported in the ''Chronicle'' entry for 491; however, it does imply that the invasion was on a scale that left little space for the British.<ref name=Stenton_17 />\n\nThese lines of reasoning cannot prove the dates given in the ''Chronicle'', much less the details surrounding \u00c6lle himself, but they do support the idea of an early conquest and the establishment of a settled kingdom.<ref name=BlairRBaEE_176_2 /><ref name=Blair_IASE_22>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', p. 22.</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n[[Image:SE England Aelle.gif|thumb|250px|right|A map of south-eastern England showing places visited by \u00c6lle, according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', and the area of modern Sussex]]If the dates given by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' are accurate to within half a century, then \u00c6lle's reign lies in the middle of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, and prior to the final conquest of the Britons. It also seems consistent with the dates given to assume that \u00c6lle's battles predate Mons Badonicus.This in turn would explain the long gap, of fifty or more years, in the succession of the \"bretwaldas\": if the peace gained by the Britons did indeed hold till the second half of the 6th century, it is not to be expected that an Anglo-Saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of England during that time. The idea of a pause in the Anglo-Saxon advance is also supported by the account in Procopius of 6th century migration from Britain to the kingdom of the [[Franks]].<ref name=Stenton_17/>  Procopius's account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of [[Armorica]] (now [[Brittany]], in [[France]]); the settlers appear to have been at least partly from [[Dumnonia]] (modern [[Cornwall]]), and the area acquired regions known as Dumnon\u00e9e and Cornouaille.<ref name=Campbell_TAS_22>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 22.</ref>  It seems likely that something at that time was interrupting the general flow of the Anglo-Saxons from the continent to Britain.<ref name=Stenton_12>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 12.</ref>\n\nThe dates for \u00c6lle's battles are also reasonably consistent with what is known of events in the kingdom of the Franks at that time.  [[Clovis I]] united the Franks into a single kingdom during the 480s and afterwards, and the Franks' ability to exercise power along the southern coast of the English channel may have diverted Saxon adventurers to England rather than the continent.<ref name=Stenton_12 />\n\nIt is possible, therefore, that a historical king named \u00c6lle existed, who arrived from the continent in the late 5th century, and who conquered much of what is now Sussex.  He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time.  This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain.<ref name=Fletcher_17>Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', p. 17.</ref>  The battles listed in the ''Chronicle'' are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east, against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years.<ref name=Stenton_17 />  His area of military control may have extended as far as [[Hampshire]] and north to the upper [[Thames]] valley, but it certainly did not extend across all of England south of the Humber, as Bede asserts.<ref name=Kirby_55>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 55.</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Guy Halsall]] argues that as \u00c6lle immediately preceded the late sixth-century King Ceawlin as Bretwalda, it is far more likely that \u00c6lle dates to the mid sixth century, and that the ''Chronicle'' has moved his dates back a century in order to provide a foundation myth for Sussex which puts it chronologically and geographically between the origins of the kingdoms of Kent and Wessex.<ref>Halsall, ''Worlds of Arthur'', p. 71</ref>\n\n==Death and burial==\n\u00c6lle's death is not recorded by the ''Chronicle'', which gives no information about him, or his sons, or the South Saxons until 675, when the South Saxon king [[Aethelwalh of Sussex|\u00c6thelwalh]] was baptized.<ref name=Stenton_12 />\n\nIt has been conjectured that, as Saxon war leader, \u00c6lle may have met his death in the disastrous battle of [[Mount Badon]] when the Britons halted Saxon expansion<ref name=\"InSaxonSx\">Alec Hamilton-Barr. In Saxon Sussex.  The Arundel Press, Bognor Regis.  p 21</ref>   If \u00c6lle died within the borders of his own kingdom then it may well have been that he was buried on [[Highdown Hill]] with his weapons and ornaments in the usual mode of burial among the South Saxons.<ref name=\"InSaxonSx\"/>  Highdown Hill is the traditional burial-place of the kings of Sussex.<ref name=\"InSaxonSx\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Timeline of the Anglo-Saxon invasion and takeover of Britain]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n'''Primary sources'''\n\n*{{Cite book |last= Bede|authorlink= Bede|title= [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]|translator= Leo Sherley-Price|others= Revised by R.E.

Looking for outside investors, Bushnell sold Atari to [[Time-Warner|Warner Communications]] in 1976 for an estimated $28\u201332 million, using part of the money to buy the [[Peter Folger|Folgers]] Mansion.  Nolan continued to have disagreements with Warner Management over the direction of the company, the discontinuation of the pinball division, and most importantly, the notion of discontinuing the 2600.  In 1978, Kee Games was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html |title=A History of Syzygy / Atari |publisher= |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117063609/http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html |archivedate=November 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  In December of that year, [[Nolan Bushnell]] was fired following an argument with Manny Gerard.  \"[W]e started fighting like cats and dogs.

The original team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years; it then set forth to build the most powerful machine possible within that time frame.  Mid-way into their effort the [[home computer]] revolution took off, leading to the addition of a keyboard and features to produce the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]] and its smaller sibling, the 400.  The new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.  From this platform Atari released their next-generation game console in 1982, the [[Atari 5200]].  It was unsuccessful due to incompatibility with the 2600 game library, a small quantity of dedicated games, and notoriously unreliable controllers.\n\nUnder Warner and Atari's chairman and CEO, [[Raymond Kassar]], the company achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers.  At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest growing company in US history at the time.  However, it ran into problems in the early 1980s as interference from the New York-based Warner management increasingly affected daily operations. Its [[home computer]], [[video game console]], and [[Video arcade|arcade]] divisions operated independently and rarely cooperated.  Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.\n\nThese problems were followed by the [[video game crash of 1983]], with losses that totaled more than $500 million.  Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. In 1983, Ray Kassar had resigned and executives involved in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] merger lost track of negotiations, eventually killing the deal.  With Atari's financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16, 1983, release, [[Nintendo]] decided to remain independent.\n\nFinancial problems continued to mount and Kassar's successor, [[James J. Morgan]], had less than a year in which to tackle the company's problems.  He began a massive restructuring of the company and worked with Warner Communications in May 1984 to create \"NATCO\" (an acronym for New Atari Company).  NATCO further streamlined the company's facilities, personnel, and spending.  Unknown to James Morgan and the senior management of Atari, Warner had been in talks with Tramiel Technology to buy Atari's consumer electronics and home computer divisions.  Negotiating until close to midnight on July 1, 1984, [[Jack Tramiel]] purchased Atari.  Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to Tramiel for $50 cash and $240 million in promissory notes and stocks, giving Warner a 20% stake in Atari Corporation<ref name=\"sale\">{{Cite news\n |last=Sange \n |first=David E. \n |title=Warner Sells Atari To Tramiel \n |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] \n |pages=Late City Final Edition, Section D, Page 1, Column 6, 1115 words \n |date=July 3, 1984 \n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/business/warner-sells-atari-to-tramiel.html \n |postscript=<!--None--> \n |deadurl=no \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118132248/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/business/warner-sells-atari-to-tramiel.html \n |archivedate=November 18, 2016 \n}}</ref> who then used it to create a new company under the name '''Atari Corporation'''.

King's College ([[University of King's College]]) was an [[Anglican]] school and [[Dalhousie University]], which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the [[Church of Scotland]]. It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar, Edmund Crawley, to the Chair of [[Classics]], as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a college established and run by the Baptists.\n\nIn 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for Queen Victoria). The college began with 21 students in January 1839. The name \"Queen's College\" was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed \"Acadia College\" in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an [[Acadian]] settlement. Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891,<ref name=\"Longley, R. S 1938\"/> established by the Acadia University Act.<ref name=\"Amendment Act\"/>\n\nThe Granville Street Baptist Church (now [[First Baptist Church (Halifax)]]) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the university. It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development. Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president John Pryor, were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation. Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.\n\nThe original charter of the college stated:\n\n{{quote|And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion&nbsp;... And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.}}\n\nThis was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.\n\nIn 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">{{cite book |editor-first1=Lawrence J. |editor-last1=Burpee |editor-first2=Arthur |editor-last2=Doughty |title=The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History |publisher= Morang & Co. |location=Toronto, Ontario |date=1912 |edition=Project Gutenberg |orig-year=2010 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm |access-date=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nCharles Osborne Wickenden (architect) and J.C.

The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution. The first was 24 February to 12 March 2004. The second was 15 October to 5 November 2007. The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister, [[Mark Parent]], appointed a mediator, on 1 November, to facilitate an agreement.\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox Canadian university rankings\n| MAC_undergrad = 4\n| MAC_rep = 26\n}}\n===Rankings===\nIn ''[[Maclean's]]'' 2019 Guide to Canadian Universities, Acadia was ranked 4th in the publication's \"primarily undergraduate\" Canadian university category.<ref name=\"Macdocu\"/> In the same year, the publication ranked Acadia 26th, in its overall national reputation rankings.<ref name=\"Macrep\"/>\n\n===Faculties===\nAcadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure & Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology. Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research.\n\n==Research==\nThe Division of Research & Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs.\n\nAcadia's research programs explore coastal environments, ethno-cultural diversity, social justice, environmental monitoring and climate change, organizational relationships, data mining, the impact of digital technologies, and lifestyle choices contributing to health and wellness. Acadia's research centres include the Tidal Energy Institute, the Acadia Institute for Data Analytics, and the Beaubassin Field Station. Applied research opportunities include research with local wineries and grape growers, alternative insect control techniques and technologies.<ref name=\"Acadia University\"/>\n\n==Innovation==\n\n===The Acadia Advantage===\n\nIn 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.\n\nThis academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching. By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative. The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.\n\nBecause of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History. It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.\n\nIn addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for [[Ubiquitous computing|Ubiquitous Computing]]. In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual ''[[Maclean's]]'' University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.\n\nIn October 2006, Dr. Dinter-Gottlieb established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception. The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere. The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.\n\nSome of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model. The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.\n\nThe University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.  In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acadiau.ca/advantage |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202144636/http://acadiau.ca/advantage/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 December 1998 |title=Acadia Advantage |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia Advantage |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\nAcadia's sports teams are called the [[Acadia Axemen|Axemen]] and [[Acadia Axewomen|Axewomen]]. They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of [[U Sports]].\n\nSchool spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport. Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.\n\nExpansion and modernization of [[Raymond Field]] was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the [[National Football League]] for its main playing field. The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province. War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.\n\nIn September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tritons.ca |title=Wolfville Tritons Swim Club |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> and the Acadia Masters Swim Club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.ns.sympatico.ca/masters/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101074057/http://www3.ns.sympatico.ca/masters/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 January 2013 |title=Acadia Masters Swim Clug |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}</ref> to form the Acadia Swim Club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://axe.acadiau.ca/swimclub/ |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225194540/http://axe.acadiau.ca/swimclub/ |archivedate=25 December 2007 }}</ref>  and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus.

Like the classical guitar, it is often referred to simply as an '''[[acoustic guitar]]'''.\n\nThe most common type is often called a [[flat top guitar]], to distinguish it from the more specialized [[archtop guitar]] and other variations.\n\nThe [[Standard tuning#Plucked strings|standard tuning]] for an acoustic guitar is E-A-D-G-B-E (low to high), although many players, particularly [[fingerpicking|fingerpickers]], use alternate tunings ([[scordatura]]), such as [[Open G tuning|open G]] (D-G-D-G-B-D), [[open D tuning|open D]] (D-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-A-D), or [[Drop D tuning|drop D]] (D-A-D-G-B-E).\n\n== Construction ==\nSteel-string guitars vary in construction and materials. Different woods and approach to bracing affect the instrument's [[timbre]] or tone. Many players and [[luthier]]s believe a well-made guitar's tone improves over time. Decrease in the content of hemicellulose, crystallization of cellulose, and changes to lignin over time all result in its wood gaining better resonating properties.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Types ===\nSteel-string acoustic guitars are commonly constructed in several body types, varying in size, depth, and proportion. In general, the guitar's soundbox can be thought of as composed of two mating chambers: the ''upper bouts'' (a ''bout'' being the rounded corner of an instrument body) on the neck end of the body,  and ''lower bouts'' (on the bridge end). These meet at the ''waist,'' or the narrowest part of the body face near the soundhole. The proportion and overall size of these two parts helps determine the overall tonal balance and \"native sound\" of a particular body style \u2013 the larger the body, the louder the volume.\n\n* The ''00'', ''double-O'' or ''grand concert'' body type is the major body style most directly derived from the classical guitar. It has the thinnest soundbox and the smallest overall size, making it very comfortable to play but lacking in projection -volume - relative to the larger types. Its smaller size makes it suitable for younger or smaller-framed players. It is commonly called a \"parlor steel\", as it is well-suited to smaller rooms. [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]]'s 00-xxx series and [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]]'s x12 series are common examples.\n* The ''grand auditorium'' guitar, sometimes called the ''000'' or the ''triple-O'' is very similar in design to the grand concert, but slightly wider and deeper. Many 000-style guitars also have a convex back to increase the physical volume of the soundbox without making it deeper at the edges, which would affect comfort and playability. The result is a very balanced tone, comparable to the 00 but with greater volume and dynamic range and slightly more low-end response, making this Classically shaped body style very popular. [[Eric Clapton]]'s signature Martin, for example, is of this style. Martin's 000-xxx series and Taylor's x14 series are well-known examples of the grand auditorium style.\n* The ''[[Dreadnought (guitar type)|dreadnought]]'' is a large-bodied guitar which incorporates a deeper soundbox, but a smaller and less-pronounced upper bout than most styles. Its size and power gave rise to its name, from the most formidable class of warship at the time of its creation in the early 20th century. The style was designed by [[Martin Guitars]]<ref name=\"sweetwater1\">{{cite web|title=Acoustic Guitar Buying Guide|url=http://www.sweetwater.com/insync/acoustic-guitar-buying-guide/|publisher=www.sweetwater.com|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> to produce a deeper sound than \"classic\"-style guitars, with very resonant bass. Its body's combination of compact profile with a deep sound has since been copied by virtually every major steel-string luthier, making it the most popular body type. [[Martin Guitars|Martin]]'s \"D\" series guitars, such as the highly prized [[Martin D-28|D-28]], are classic examples of the dreadnought.\n* The ''jumbo'' body type is bigger again than a grand auditorium but similarly proportioned, and is generally designed to provide a deep tone similar to a dreadnought's.  It was designed by [[Gibson]] to compete with the dreadnought,<ref name=\"sweetwater1\"/>) but with maximum resonant space for greater volume and sustain. These come at the expense of being oversized, with a very deep sounding box, and thus somewhat more difficult to play. The foremost example of the style is the [[Gibson J-200]], but like the dreadnought, most guitar manufacturers have at least one jumbo model.\n\nAny of these body type can incorporate a ''[[cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]]'', where a section of the upper Below the neck is scalloped out.  This allows for easier access to the frets located atop the soundbox, at the expense of reduced soundbox volume and altered bracing, which can affect the resonant qualities and resulting tone of the instrument.\n\n* The ''[[Twelve-string guitar|12-string guitar]]'' replaces each string with a [[Course (music)|course]] of two strings. The lower pairs are tuned an octave apart. Its unique sound was made famous by artists such as [[Lead Belly]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Leo Kottke]].\n\nAll of these relatively traditional looking and constructed instruments are commonly referred to as ''flattop'' guitars. All are commonly used in popular music genres, including [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], [[Country music|country]], and [[Folk music|folk]].\n\nOther styles of guitar which enjoy moderate popularity, generally in more specific genres, include:\n* The ''[[archtop guitar|archtop]]'', which incorporates an arched, [[violin]]-like top either carved out of solid wood or heat-pressed using laminations.  It usually has violin style  f-holes rather than a single round sound hole. It is most commonly used by [[swing (genre)|swing]] and [[jazz]] players and often incorporates an electric [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. \n* The ''[[Selmer-Maccaferri guitar]]'' is usually played by those who follow the style of [[Django Reinhardt]]. It is an unusual-looking instrument, distinguished by a fairly large body with squarish bouts, and either a D-shaped or longitudinal oval soundhole. The strings are gathered at the tail like an archtop guitar, but the top is flatter. It also has a wide fingerboard and slotted head like a nylon-string guitar. The loud volume and penetrating tone make it suitable for single-note [[guitar solo|soloing]], and it is frequently employed as a [[lead guitar|lead instrument]] in [[gypsy swing]].\n* The ''[[resonator guitar]]'' or ''[[resophonic guitar]]'', also called the ''[[Dobro]]'' after its most prominent manufacturer, amplifies its sound through one or more metal cone-shaped resonators. It was designed to overcome the problem of conventional acoustic guitars being overwhelmed by horns and percussion instruments in dance orchestras. It became prized for its distinctive sound, however, and gained a place in several musical styles (most notably blues and bluegrass), and retains a niche well after the proliferation of electric amplification.\n\n=== Tonewoods ===\nTraditionally, steel-string guitars have been made of a combination of various ''[[tonewood]]s'', or woods that have pleasing resonant qualities when used in instrument-making. Foremost for making guitar tops are [[Sitka spruce]], the most common, and Alpine and Adirondack spruce. The back and sides of a particular guitar are typically made of the same wood; Brazilian or East Indian [[rosewood]] and Honduras [[mahogany]] are traditional choices, however, [[maple]] has been prized for the figuring that can be seen when it is cut in a certain way (such as ''flame'' and ''quilt'' patterns). A common non-traditional wood gaining popularity is [[sapele]], which is tonally similar to mahogany but slightly lighter in color and possessing a deep grain structure that is visually appealing.\n\nDue to decreasing availability and rising prices of premium-quality traditional tonewoods, many manufacturers have begun experimenting with alternative species of woods or more commonly available variations on the standard species. For example, some makers have begun producing models with [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] or mahogany tops, or with [[spruce]] variants other than Sitka. Cedar is also common in the back and sides, as is [[basswood]]. Entry-level models, especially those made in East Asia, often use [[nato wood]], which is again tonally similar to mahogany but is cheap to acquire. Some have also begun using non-wood materials, such as [[plastic]] or [[graphite]]. Carbon-fiber and phenolic composite materials have become desirable for building necks, and some high-end luthiers produce all-carbon-fiber guitars.\n\n=== Assembly ===\n{{for|more details on the construction of acoustic guitars|Guitar#Construction}}\nThe steel-string acoustic guitar evolved from the nylon- or gut-string classical guitar, and because steel strings have higher tension, heavier construction is required overall. One innovation is a metal bar called a [[guitar#Truss rod|truss rod]], which is incorporated into the neck to strengthen it and provide adjustable counter-tension to the stress of the strings. Typically, a steel-string acoustic guitar is built with a larger soundbox than a standard classical guitar. A critical structural and tonal component of an acoustic guitar is the [[Guitar bracing|bracing]], a systems of struts glued to the inside of the back and top. Steel-string guitars use different bracing systems from classical guitars, typically using X-bracing instead of fan bracing. (Another simpler system, called ladder bracing, where the braces are all placed across the width of the instrument, is used on all types of flat-top guitars on the back.) Innovations in bracing design have emerged, notably the A-brace developed by British luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars.\n\nMost [[luthier]]s and experienced players agree that a good solid top (as opposed to laminated or [[plywood]]) is the most important factor in the tone of the guitar. Solid backs and sides can also contribute to a pleasant sound, although laminated sides and backs are acceptable alternatives, commonly found in mid-level guitars (in the range of US$300\u2013$1000).\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, \"by far the most significant developments in the design and construction of acoustic guitars\" were made by the [[Ovation Guitar Company]].<ref name=\"Denyer 1992\">{{Cite book\n | title = The guitar handbook\n | first = Ralph\n | last = Denyer\n | others = Special contributors [[Isaac&nbsp;Guillory]] and <!-- NOT [[Alastair Crawford]] -->Alastair&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Crawford; [[Robert&nbsp;Fripp]] (foreword)\n | pages = 48\n | chapter=Ovation guitars (Acoustic guitars)\n | isbn = 0-330-32750-X\n | location = London and Sydney\n | publisher = Pan Books\n | edition= Fully revised and updated\n | year = 1992\n}}</ref> It introduced a composite ''roundback'' bowl, which replaced the square back and sides of traditional guitars; because of its engineering design, Ovation guitars could be amplified without producing the obnoxious feedback that had plagued acoustic guitars before. Ovation also pioneered with electronics, such as [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] systems and electronic tuners.<ref name=\"Denyer 1992\"/><ref>\n* {{cite news|last=Anonymous|date=1 October 2004|first=Music Trades|title=Ovation's encore: How a host of product refinements have rekindled growth at Kaman&nbsp;Music's flagship guitar&nbsp;division|series=The Guitar Market|newspaper=[[The Music Trades]]|accessdate=1 May 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-124136480.html|id=(subscription required)|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Carter|first=Walter|year=1996|title=The history of the Ovation guitar|editor-first=Jon|editor-last=Eiche|publisher=[[Hal&nbsp;Leonard Corporation]]|series=Musical Instruments Series|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-7935-5876-6|edition=first|pages=1\u2013128|id=HL00330187<!-- Hal Leonard -->|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D15FA3A580C7B8CDDAB0994DE494D81 <!-- alternate link: http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/nyregion/from-the-ratcheting-of-helicopters-to-a-guitar-s-hum.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm -->|title=From the ratcheting of helicopters to a guitar's hum|first=Valerie|last=Cruice|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 8, 1996|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|date=30\u201331 May 1999|last= Marks|first=Brenda|title=Connecticut&nbsp;firm makes guitars, helicopter&nbsp;blades from same fiberglass|publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|location=New Hartford, Conn.|newspaper=[[Waterbury Republican-American]]|accessdate=24 April 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54758412.html|subscription =yes|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n== Amplification ==\nA steel-string guitar can be {{em|amplified}} using any of three techniques:\n* a [[microphone]], possibly clipped to the guitar body;\n* a detachable [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], often straddling the soundhole and using the same magnetic principle as a traditional electric guitar; or\n* a [[transducer]] built into the body.\n\nThe last type of guitar is commonly called an ''acoustic-electric'' or ''[[electro-acoustic guitar|electro-acoustic]]'' guitar, as it can be played either \"[[Acoustic music|unplugged]]\" as an acoustic, or plugged in as an electric. The most common type is a [[piezoelectric pickup]], which is composed of a thin sandwich of quartz crystal. When compressed, the crystal produces a small electric current, so when placed under the bridge saddle, the vibrations of the strings through the saddle, and of the body of the instrument, are converted to a weak electrical signal. This signal is often sent to a [[pre-amplifier]], which increases the signal strength and normally incorporates an [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]]. The output of the preamplifier then goes to a separate amplifier system similar to that for an electric guitar.\n\nSeveral manufacturers produce specialised [[acoustic guitar amplifier]]s, which are designed to give undistorted and full-range reproduction.\n\n== Music and players ==\nUntil the 1960s, the predominant forms of music played on the flat-top, steel-string guitar remained relatively stable and included acoustic [[blues]], [[American country music|country]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], and several genres of [[rock music|rock]]. The concept of playing solo steel-string guitar in a concert setting was introduced in the early 1960s by such performers as [[Davey Graham]] and [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], who used [[country blues]] [[fingerpicking]] techniques to compose original compositions with structures somewhat like [[European classical music]]. Fahey contemporary [[Robbie Basho]] added elements of [[Indian classical music]] and [[Leo Kottke]] used a Faheyesque approach to make the first solo steel-string guitar \"hit\" record.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSteel-string guitars are also important in the world of [[flatpicking]], as utilized by such artists as [[Clarence White]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Bryan Sutton]], [[Doc Watson]] and [[David Grier]]. Luthiers have been experimenting with redesigning the acoustic guitar for these players. These flat-top, steel-string guitars are constructed and voiced more for classical-like fingerpicking and less for chordal accompaniment (strumming). Some luthiers have increasingly focused their attention on the needs of fingerstylists and have developed unique guitars for this style of playing.\n\nMany other luthiers attempt to recreate the guitars of the \"Golden Era\" of [[Martin Guitars|C.F. Martin & Co]]. This was started by Roy Noble, who built the guitar played by Clarence White from 1968 to 1972, and was followed by Bill Collings, Marty Lanham, [[Dana Bourgeois]], Randy Lucas, Lynn Dudenbostel and [[Wayne Henderson (luthier)|Wayne Henderson]], a few of the luthiers building guitars today inspired by vintage Martins, the pre\u2013World War II models in particular. As prices for vintage Martins continue to rise exponentially, upscale guitar enthusiasts have demanded faithful recreations and luthiers are working to fill that demand.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Guitar}}\n* [[Guitar]]\n* [[List of guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[Charlie Nothing#Dingulator|Dingulator]]\n* [[Strumming]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Guitars|Type}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Steel-String Acoustic Guitar}}\n[[Category:Acoustic guitars]]\n[[Category:American musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]", "sha1": "sn9gwmrll00ll7zx7si5ofsiaecfnre"}}, {"title": "Antipope John XXIII", "ns": "0", "id": "2238", "revision": {"id": "866161142", "parentid": "866161031", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T17:44:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hairy Dude", "id": "274535"}, "comment": "{{plainlist}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|the twentieth-century pope|Pope John XXIII}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2011}}\n{{lead too short|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Antipope\n| type             = Antipope\n| honorific-prefix = Antipope\n| name             = John XXIII\n| honorific-suffix = \n| title            = \n| image            = Johannes XXIII Gegenpapst.jpg\n| caption          = \n| enthroned        = 1410\n| ended            = 1415\n| predecessor      = [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] \n| successor        = \n| opposed          = {{plainlist|\n*[[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] <small>(Roman claimant)</small>\n*[[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] <small>(Avignon claimant)</small>}}\n| ordination       = \n| consecration     = \n| other_post       = \n| birth_name       = \n| birth_date       = c. 1365\n| birth_place      = [[Procida]], [[Kingdom of Naples]]\n| death_date       = 22 {{death year and age|1419|1370|12}}\n| death_place      = [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]]\n| buried           = \n| nationality      = \n| religion         = \n| residence        = \n| parents          = \n| spouse           = \n| children         = \n| alma_mater       = \n| signature        = \n| other            = John\n| coat_of_arms     = C o a Giovanni XXIII (Pisa).svg\n}}\n\n'''Baldassarre Cossa''' (c. 1370 \u2013 22 December 1419) was [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] [[antipope]] '''John XXIII''' (1410\u20131415) during the [[Western Schism]]. The Catholic Church regards him as an [[antipope]], as he opposed [[Pope Gregory XII]] whom the Catholic Church now recognizes as the rightful successor of Saint Peter. He was eventually deposed and tried for various crimes, though later accounts question the veracity of those accusations.\n\n== Early life ==\nBaldassarre Cossa was born on the island of [[Procida]] or in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] to the family of Giovanni Cossa, lord of Procida. Initially he followed a military career, taking part in the [[Kingdom of Naples|Angevin-Neapolitan war]]. His two brothers were sentenced to death for [[piracy]] by [[Ladislaus of Naples]].<ref name=mccabe>{{cite book|author=Joseph McCabe|title=Crises in the History of the Papacy|chapter=Chapter XI.

(The [[Western Schism]] had begun in 1378, and there were two competing popes at the time, one in Avignon supported by France and Spain, and one in Rome, supported by most of Italy, Germany and England.) In 1386 he is listed as canon of the cathedral of Bologna. In 1396, he became archdeacon in Bologna. He became [[cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinal deacon|Cardinal deacon]] of Saint Eustachius in 1402 and [[Papal legate]] in [[Romagna]] in 1403. [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] describes Cossa as \"utterly worldly-minded, ambitious, crafty, unscrupulous, and immoral, a good soldier but no churchman\".<ref name=Kirsch>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08434a.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. \"John XXIII.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 January 2016</ref> At this time Cossa also had some links with local robber bands, which were often used to intimidate his rivals and attack carriages. These connections added to his influence and power in the region.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2011| p=158}}\n\n== Role in the Western Schism ==\n\n=== The Council of Pisa ===\nCardinal Cossa was one of the seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] who, in May 1408, withdrew their allegiance from [[Pope Gregory XII]], stating that he had broken his solemn oath not to create new cardinals without consulting them in advance.  In company with those cardinals who had been following [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, they convened the [[Council of Pisa]], of which Cossa became a leading figure. The aim of the council was to end the schism; to this end they deposed both Gregory XII and Benedict XIII and elected a new pope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] in 1409.<ref name=Kirsch/> Gregory and Benedict ignored this decision, however, so that there were now three simultaneous claimants to the [[papacy]].\n\n=== Election to the papacy ===\nAlexander V died soon after, and on 25 May 1410 Cossa was consecrated a bishop, taking the name John XXIII. He had become an [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained priest]] only one day earlier. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]]; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and Gregory XII was still favored by [[Ladislaus of Naples]], [[Carlo I Malatesta]], the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|princes of Bavaria]], [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Elector Palatine]], and parts of Germany and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]].<ref>Lightbown, R.W.

Following his election as pope, John spent a year in Bologna and then joined forces with [[Louis II of Anjou]] to march against Ladislaus. An initial victory proved short-lived and Ladislaus retook Rome in May 1413, forcing John to flee to Florence.<ref name=Kirsch/> In Florence he met [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of the Romans. Sigismund wanted to end the schism and urged John to call a general council. John did so with hesitation, at first trying to have the council held in Italy (rather than in a German [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]], as Sigismund wanted). The [[Council of Constance]] was convened on 30 October 1413. During the third session, rival [[Pope Gregory XII]] authorized the council as well. The council resolved that all three popes should abdicate and a new pope be elected.<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1419.htm Miranda, Salvador. \"Cossa, Baldassare\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref>\n\n=== Flight from the Council of Constance ===\nIn March, John escaped from Constance disguised as a postman.<ref name=Miranda/> According to the Klingenberger Chronicle, written by a noble client of [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]], John XXIII travelled down the Rhine to Schaffhausen in a boat, while Frederick accompanied him with a small band of men on horseback. There was a huge outcry in Constance when it was discovered that John had fled, and Sigismund was furious about this setback to his plans for ending the Schism. The King of the Romans issued orders to all the powers on the Upper Rhine and in Swabia stating that he had declared Frederick to be an outlaw and that his lands and possessions were forfeit. In due course this led to a great deal of political upheaval and many Austrian losses in the region, notably in [[Aargau]] to the [[Swiss Confederation]].\n\nIn the meantime, Pope John XXIII and Frederick fled further downriver along the Rhine to the town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], which recognised the duke of Austria as its lord. There Sigismund's lieutenant [[Ludwig III, Elector Palatine]] caught up with them. He convinced Frederick that he stood to lose too much by harbouring the fugitive pope, and the Austrian duke agreed to give himself and John up and return to Constance.<ref>Brandm\u00fcller, Walter. ''Das Konzil von Konstanz'', 1414-1418 (Paderborn, 1991-7)</ref>\n\n=== Deposition ===\nDuring his absence John was deposed by the council, and upon his return he was tried for heresy, simony, schism and immorality, and found guilty on all counts.

''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', New York: The Heritage Press, 1946, vol. 3, p. 2417</ref> John was given over to [[Ludwig III, Elector Palatine]], who imprisoned him for several months in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Mannheim]].\nThe last remaining claimant in Avignon, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], refused to resign and was excommunicated. [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] was elected as new pope in 1417.\n\n== Death and burial ==\n[[File:Grabmaljohannes13.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]].]]\nCossa was again imprisoned in Germany.

He was born in [[Legnago]], south of [[Verona]], in the [[Republic of Venice]], and spent his adult life and career as a subject of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\nSalieri was a pivotal figure in the development of late 18th-century opera. As a student of [[Florian Leopold Gassmann]], and a [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], Salieri was a cosmopolitan composer who wrote operas in three languages. Salieri helped to develop and shape many of the features of operatic compositional vocabulary, and his music was a powerful influence on contemporary composers.\n\nAppointed the director of the Italian opera by the Habsburg court, a post he held from 1774 until 1792, Salieri dominated Italian-language opera in [[Vienna]]. During his career he also spent time writing works for opera houses in Paris, Rome, and Venice, and his dramatic works were widely performed throughout Europe during his lifetime. As the Austrian imperial [[Kapellmeister]] from 1788 to 1824, he was responsible for music at the court chapel and attached school. Even as his works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought-after teachers of his generation, and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] were among the most famous of his pupils.\n\nSalieri's music slowly disappeared from the repertoire between 1800 and 1868 and was rarely heard after that period until the revival of his fame in the late 20th century. This revival was due to the dramatic and highly fictionalized depiction of Salieri in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus]]'' (1979) and its [[Amadeus (film)|1984 film version]]. The [[death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] in 1791 at the age of 35 was followed by rumours that he and Salieri had been bitter rivals, and that Salieri had poisoned the younger composer, yet it is likely that they were, at least, mutually respectful peers.\n\n==Life and career==\nSalieri started his musical studies in his native town of [[Legnago]]; he was first taught at home by his older brother Francesco Salieri (a former student of the violinist and composer [[Giuseppe Tartini]]), and he received further lessons from the organist of the Legnago Cathedral, Giuseppe Simoni, a pupil of Padre [[Giovanni Battista Martini]].<ref name=\"Braunbehrens, pp. 14\u201315\">Braunbehrens, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Salieri remembered little from his childhood in later years except passions for sugar, reading, and music. He twice ran away from home without permission to hear his elder brother play violin concertos in neighboring churches on festival days (resulting in the loss of his beloved sugar), and he recounted being chastised by his father after failing to greet a local priest with proper respect. Salieri responded to the reprimand by saying the priest's organ playing displeased him because it was in an inappropriately theatrical style.<ref>Thayer, p. 28.</ref> Sometime between 1763 and 1764, both of Salieri's parents died, and he was briefly taken in by an anonymous brother, a monk in [[Padua]], and then for unknown reasons in 1765 or 1766, he became the ward of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni Mocenigo (which Giovanni is at this time unknown), a member of the powerful and well connected [[Mocenigo family]].<ref name=\"Braunbehrens, pp. 14\u201315\" /> It is possible that Salieri's father and Mocenigo were friends or business associates, but this is obscure. While living in [[Venice]], Salieri continued his musical studies with the organist and opera composer [[Giovanni Battista Pescetti]], then following Pescetti's sudden death he studied with the opera singer Ferdinando Pacini (or Pasini). It was through Pacini that Salieri gained the attention of the composer [[Florian Leopold Gassmann]], who, impressed with his protege's talents and concerned for the boy's future, took the young orphan to Vienna, where he personally directed and paid for the remainder of Salieri's musical education.<ref>Braunbehrens pp. 19\u201322</ref>\n\nSalieri and Gassmann arrived in Vienna on 15 June 1766. Gassmann's first act was to take Salieri to the Italian Church to consecrate his teaching and service to God, an event that left a deep impression on Salieri for the rest of his life.<ref>Thayer, pp. 30\u201331</ref> Salieri's education included instruction in Latin and Italian poetry by Fr. Don Pietro Tommasi, instruction in the German language, and European literature. His music studies revolved around vocal composition and [[thoroughbass]]. His musical theory training in [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] was rooted in [[Johann Fux]]'s ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum#Fux|Gradus ad Parnassum]]'',<ref>Thayer, pp. 30\u201331, also Rice pp. 17\u201320</ref> which Salieri translated during each Latin lesson.<ref>Thayer, pp. 17\u201320</ref> As a result, Salieri continued to live with Gassmann even after Gassmann's marriage, an arrangement that lasted until the year of Gassmann's death and Salieri's own marriage in 1774.<ref>Rice, pp. 19\u201322, and p. 27</ref> Few of Salieri's compositions have survived from this early period. In his old age Salieri hinted that these works were either purposely destroyed or had been lost, with the exception of a few works for the church.<ref>Rice, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Among these sacred works there survives a [[Mass (music)|Mass]] in C major written without a \"Gloria\" and in the antique [[a cappella]] style (presumably for one of the church's penitential seasons) and dated 2 August 1767.<ref>Hettrick, Jane ed.; Salieri, Antonio, ''Missa stylo a cappella''; Preface. [v\u2013vii] Doblinger (1993)</ref> A complete opera composed in 1769 (presumably as a culminating study) ''La vestale'' (''The Vestal Virgin'') has also been lost.<ref>Braunbehrens p. 26, also Rice p. 20</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1766 Gassmann introduced Salieri to the daily [[chamber music]] performances held during [[Emperor Joseph II]]'s evening meal. Salieri quickly impressed the Emperor, and Gassmann was instructed to bring his pupil as often as he wished.<ref>Thayer, p. 38</ref><ref>Rice, pp. 21\u201327</ref> This was the beginning of a relationship between monarch and musician that lasted until Joseph's death in 1790. Salieri met Pietro Antonio Domenico Trapassi, better known as [[Metastasio]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] during this period at the Sunday morning salons held at the home of the Martinez family. Metastasio had an apartment there and participated in the weekly gatherings. Over the next several years Metastasio gave Salieri informal instruction in prosody and the declamation of Italian poetry,<ref>Thayer pp. 41\u201342</ref> and Gluck became an informal advisor, friend and confidante.<ref>Braunbehrens, pp. 22\u201323</ref><ref>Rice, pp. 17, 21, 32</ref> It was toward the end of this extended period of study that Gassmann was called away on a new opera commission and a gap in the theater's program allowed for Salieri to make his debut as a composer of a completely original ''[[opera buffa]]''. Salieri's first full opera was composed during the winter and carnival season of 1770; ''[[Le donne letterate]]'' and was based on [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s ''[[Les Femmes Savantes]]'' (''The Learned Ladies'') with a [[libretto]] by {{ill|Giovanni Gastone Boccherini|it}}, a dancer in the court ballet and a brother of the composer [[Luigi Boccherini]].<ref>Rice, pp. 113\u2013151 features an extensive overview of this opera</ref> The modest success of this opera launched Salieri's 34-year operatic career as a composer of over 35 original dramas.<ref>Braunbehrens pp. 28\u201329</ref>\n\n===Early Viennese period and operas (1770\u20131778)===\nFollowing the modest success of ''Le donne letterate'' Salieri received new commissions writing two additional operas in 1770, both with libretti by Giovanni Boccherini. The first, a pastoral opera, ''[[L'amore innocente]]'' (''Innocent Love''), was a light-hearted comedy set in the Austrian mountains.<ref>Braunbehrens p. 29.</ref> The second was based on an episode from [[Cervantes]] ''[[Don Quixote]]'' \u2013 \"Don Chisciotte alle nozze di Gamace\" (Don Quixote at the marriage of Camacho).<ref>Rice for an extended discussion of this work, pp. 153\u2013162</ref> In these first works, drawn mostly from the traditions of mid-century ''[[opera buffa]]'', Salieri showed a penchant for experimentation and for mixing the established characteristics of specific operatic genres. ''Don Chisciotte'' was a mix of ballet and opera buffa, and the lead female roles in ''L'amore innocente'' were designed to contrast and highlight the different traditions of operatic writing for soprano, even borrowing stylistic flourishes from ''[[opera seria]]'' in the use of coloratura in what was a short pastoral comedy more in keeping with a Roman [[Intermezzo]].<ref>See Rice for genre categorizations of ''L'amore innocente'', pp. 107\u201309, 152\u201353, 177.</ref> The mixing and pushing against the boundaries of established operatic genres was a continuing hallmark of Salieri's own personal style, and in his choice of material for the plot (as in his first opera), he manifested a lifelong interest in subjects drawn from classic drama and literature.\n\nSalieri's first great success was in the realm of serious opera. Commissioned for an unknown occasion, Salieri's ''[[Armida (Salieri)|Armida]]'' was based on [[Torquato Tasso]]'s epic poem ''La Gerusalemme liberata'' (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''); it premiered on 2 June 1771.<ref>Rice pp. 162\u201364.</ref> ''Armida'' is a tale of love and duty in conflict and is saturated in magic. The opera is set during the [[First Crusade]] and features a dramatic mix of ballet, aria, ensemble, and choral writing, combining theatricality, scenic splendor, and high emotionalism. The work clearly followed in Gluck's footsteps and embraced his reform of serious opera begun with ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]''. The libretto to ''Armida'' was by [[Marco Coltellini]], the house poet for the imperial theaters. While Salieri followed the precepts set forth by Gluck and his librettist [[Ranieri de' Calzabigi]] in the preface to ''Alceste'', Salieri also drew on some musical ideas from the more traditional opera seria and even opera buffa, creating a new synthesis in the process. ''Armida'' was translated into German and widely performed, especially in the northern German states, where it helped to establish Salieri's reputation as an important and innovative modern composer<ref>Rice pp. 175.</ref> It was also the first opera to receive a serious preparation in a piano and vocal reduction by {{ill|Carl Friedrich Cramer|de}} in 1783.<ref>Braunbehrens, pp. 33\u201334.</ref><ref>Rice, p. 175.</ref>\n\n''Armida'' was soon followed by Salieri's first truly popular success, a ''[[commedia per musica]]'' in the style of [[Carlo Goldoni]] ''[[La fiera di Venezia]]'' (''The Fair of Venice''). ''La fiera'' was written for [[Carnival]] in 1772 and premiered on 29 January. Here Salieri returned to his collaboration with the young Giovanni Boccherini, who crafted an original plot. ''La fiera'' featured characters singing in three languages, a bustling portrayal of the Ascension-tide Fair and Carnival in Venice, and large and lengthy ensembles and choruses. It also included an innovative scene that combined a series of on-stage dances with singing from both solo protagonists and the chorus. This was a pattern imitated by later composers, most famously and successfully by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] in ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. Salieri also wrote several bravura arias for a soprano playing the part of a middle class character that combined ''[[coloratura]]'' and ''[[concertante]]'' woodwind solos, another innovation for comic opera that was widely imitated.<ref name=Grove>{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]]|chapter=Salieri, Antonio|first1=Jane|last1=Schatkin Hettrik|first2=John A.|last2=Rice|authorlink2=John A. Rice (musicologist)}}</ref>\n\nSalieri's next two operas were not particular or lasting successes. ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (''The Stolen Bucket'') is a parody of the high flown and emotive arias found in [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasian]] ''[[opera seria]]''. It also contains innovative orchestrations, including the first known use of three tympani. Again a classic of [[Renaissance]] literature was the basis of the libretto by Boccherini, in this case a comic mock-epic by [[Alessandro Tassoni|Tassoni]], in which a war between [[Modena]] and [[Bologna]] follows the theft of a bucket. This uneven work was followed by a popular comedic success ''{{ill|La locandiera (opera)|it|La locandiera (opera)|lt=La locandiera}}'' (''The Mistress of the Inn''), an adaptation of the classic and popular spoken stage comedy ''[[La locandiera]]'' by Carlo Goldoni, with the libretto prepared by Domenico Poggi.\n\nThe majority of Salieri's modest number of instrumental works also date from this time. Salieri's instrumental works have been judged by various critics and scholars {{who|date=October 2015}} to lack the inspiration and innovation found in his writing for the stage. These orchestral works are mainly in the galant style, and although they show some development toward the late classical, they reflect a general weakness in comparison to his operatic works of the same and later periods. These works were written for mostly unknown occasions and artists. They include two concertos for pianoforte, one in C major and one in B flat major (both 1773); a concerto for organ in C Major in two movements (the middle movement is missing from the autograph score, or perhaps, it was an improvised organ solo) (also 1773); and two concertante works: a concerto for oboe, violin and cello in D major (1770), and a flute and oboe concerto in C major (1774). These works are among the most frequently recorded of Salieri's compositions.\n\nUpon Gassmann's death on 21 January,{{sfn|Lorenz|2013}} most likely due to complications from an accident with a carriage some years earlier, Salieri succeeded him as assistant director of the Italian opera in early 1774.<ref>Braunbehrens p. 42</ref> On 10 October 1775 Salieri married Therese Helferstorfer, the daughter of a recently deceased financier and official of the court treasury.{{sfn|Lorenz|2013}} Sacred music was not a high priority for the composer during this stage of his career, but he did compose an Alleluia for chorus and orchestra in 1774.\n\nDuring the next three years Salieri was primarily concerned with rehearsing and conducting the Italian opera company in Vienna and with teaching. His three complete operas written during this time show the development of his compositional skills, but included no great success, either commercially or artistically. His most important compositions during this period were a symphony in D major, performed in the summer of 1776, and the oratorio ''La passione di Ges\u00f9 Cristo'' with a [[La passione di Ges\u00f9 Cristo|text by Metastasio]], performed during Advent of 1776.\n\nAfter the financial collapse of the Italian opera company in 1777 due to financial mis-management, Joseph II decided to end the performance of Italian opera, French spoken drama, and ballet. Instead, the two court-owned theaters would be reopened under new management, and partly subsidized by the Imperial Court, as a new National Theater. The re-launched theaters would promote German-language plays and musical productions that reflected Austrian (or as Joseph II would have said) German values, traditions and outlook. The Italian opera buffa company was therefore replaced by a German language [[Singspiel]] troupe. Joseph and his supporters of Imperial reform wanted to encourage pan-national pride that would unite his multi-lingual and ethnic subjects under one common language, and hoped to save a considerable amount of money in the process. Beginning in 1778 the Emperor wished to have new works, in German, composed by his own subjects and brought on the stage with clear Imperial support. This in effect left Salieri's role as assistant court composer in a much reduced position. Salieri also had never truly mastered the German language, and he now felt no longer competent to continue as assistant opera director. A further blow to his career was when the spoken drama and musical Singspiel were placed on an equal footing. For the young composer there would be few, if any, new compositional commissions to receive from the court. Salieri was left with few financial options and he began casting about for new opportunities.<ref name=Grove />\n\n===Italian tour (1778\u20131780)===\nIn 1778 Gluck turned down an offer to compose the inaugural opera for [[La Scala]] in Milan. Upon the suggestion of Joseph II and with the approval of Gluck, Salieri was offered the commission, which he gratefully accepted. Joseph II granted Salieri permission to take a year-long leave of absence (later extended), enabling him to write for La Scala and to undertake a tour of Italy. Salieri's Italian tour of 1778\u201380 began with the production of ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]'' (''Europa Recognized'') for La Scala (revived in 2004 for the same opera house's re-opening following extensive renovations). From Milan, Salieri included stops in Venice and Rome before returning to Milan. During this tour he wrote three new comic operas and he collaborated with [[Giacomo Rust]] on one opera, ''{{ill|Il talismano|it|Il talismano (opera)}}'' (''The Talisman''). Of his Italian works one, ''[[La scuola de' gelosi]]'' (''The School for Jealousy''), a witty study of amorous intrigue and emotion, would prove a popular and lasting international success.\n\n===Middle Viennese period and Parisian operas (1780\u20131788)===\nUpon his return at imperial behest to Vienna in 1780, Salieri wrote one German singspiel, ''[[Der Rauchfangkehrer]]'' (''The Chimney Sweep''), which premiered in 1781. Salieri's ''Chimney Sweep'' and Mozart's work for the same company in 1782, ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), were the only two major successes to emerge from the German singspiel experiment, and only Mozart's opera survived on the stage beyond the close of the 18th century. In 1783 the Italian opera company was revived with singers partly chosen and vetted by Salieri during his Italian tour;<ref>Rice p. 256</ref> the new season opened with a slightly re-worked version of Salieri's recent success ''La scuola de' gelosi''. Salieri then returned to his rounds of rehearsing, composition and teaching. However, his time at home in Vienna quickly ended when an opportunity to write an opera for Paris arose, again through the patronage of Gluck. Salieri traveled abroad to fulfill an important commission.\n\nThe opera ''[[Les Dana\u00efdes]]'' (''The Danaids'') is a five-act [[trag\u00e9die lyrique]]. The plot was based on an ancient Greek legend that had been the basis for the first play in a trilogy by [[Aeschylus]], entitled ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]''. The original commission that reached Salieri in 1783\u201384 was to assist Gluck in finishing a work for Paris that had been all but completed; in reality, Gluck had failed to notate any of the score for the new opera and gave the entire project over to his young friend. Gluck feared that the Parisian critics would denounce the opera by a young composer known mostly for comic pieces and so the opera was originally billed in the press as being a new work by Gluck with some assistance from Salieri, then shortly before the premiere of the opera the Parisian press reported that the work was to be partly by Gluck and partly by Salieri, and finally after popular and critical success on stage, the opera was acknowledged in a letter to the public by Gluck as being wholly by the young Salieri. ''Les Dana\u00efdes'' was received with great acclaim and its popularity with audiences and critics alike produced several further requests for new works for Paris audiences by Salieri. ''Les Dana\u00efdes'' followed in the tradition of reform that Gluck had begun in the 1760s and that Salieri had emulated in his earlier opera ''Armida''. Salieri's first [[French opera]] contained scenes of great solemnity and festivity, but overshadowing it all was darkness and revenge. The opera depicted politically motivated murder, filial duty and love in conflict, tyrannicide, and finally eternal damnation. The opera, with its dark overture, lavish choral writing, many ballet scenes, and electrifying finale depicting a glimpse of hellish torture, kept the opera on the stage in Paris for over forty years. A young [[Hector Berlioz]] recorded the deep impression this work made on him in his ''M\u00e9moires''.<ref>Berlioz, p. 22</ref>\n\nUpon returning to Vienna following his success in Paris, Salieri met and befriended [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] and had his first professional encounters with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Da Ponte wrote his first opera libretto for Salieri, ''[[Il ricco d'un giorno]]'' (A rich man for a day) in 1784, which was not a success. Salieri next turned to [[Giambattista Casti]] as a librettist; a more successful set of collaboration flowed from this pairing. In the meantime Da Ponte began working with Mozart on ''Le nozze di Figaro'' (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''). In 1785 Salieri produced one of his greatest works with the text by Casti, ''[[La grotta di Trofonio]]'' (The cave of Trophonius), the first opera buffa published in full score by [[Artaria]]. Shortly after this success Joseph II had Mozart and Salieri each contribute a one-act opera and/or singspiel for production at a banquet in 1786. Salieri collaborated with Casti to produce a parody of the relationship between poet and composer in ''[[Prima la musica e poi le parole]]'' ('First the music and then the words). This short work also highlighted the typical backstage antics of two high flown sopranos. Salieri then returned to Paris for the premiere of his trag\u00e9die lyrique ''[[Les Horaces]]'' (The Horatii), which proved a failure, which was more than made up for with his next Parisian opera ''[[Tarare (opera)|Tarare]]'', with a libretto by [[Pierre Beaumarchais|Beaumarchais]]. This was intended to be the ''{{Lang|la|[[nec plus ultra]]}}'' of reform opera, a completely new synthesis of poetry and music that was an 18th-century anticipation of the ideals of [[Richard Wagner]]. Salieri also created a sacred cantata ''Le Jugement dernier'' (The Last Judgement). The success of his opera ''Tarare'' was such that it was soon translated into Italian at Joseph II's behest by Lorenzo Da Ponte as ''[[Axur, re d'Ormus]]'' (Axur, king of Hormuz) and staged at the royal wedding of [[Franz II]] in 1788.\n\n===Late Viennese operas (1788\u20131804)===\nIn 1788 Salieri returned to Vienna, where he remained for the rest of his life. In that year he became Kapellmeister of the Imperial Chapel upon the death of [[Giuseppe Bonno]]; as Kapellmeister he conducted the music and musical school connected with the chapel until shortly before his death, being officially retired from the post in 1824.\n\nHis Italian adaptation of ''Tarare'', ''Axur'' would prove to be his greatest international success. ''Axur'' was widely produced throughout Europe and it even reached South America with the exiled royal house of Portugal in 1824. ''Axur'' and his other new compositions completed by 1792 would mark the height of Salieri's popularity and his influence. Just as his apogee of fame was being reached abroad, his influence in Vienna would begin to diminish with the death of Joseph II in 1790. Joseph's death deprived Salieri of his greatest patron and protector. During this period of imperial change in Vienna and revolutionary ferment in France, Salieri composed two additional extremely innovative musical dramas to libretti by Giovanni Casti. Due, however, to their satiric and overtly liberal political inclinations, both operas were seen as unsuitable for public performance in the politically reactive cultures of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] and later [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]]. This resulted in two of his most original operas being consigned to his desk drawer, namely ''Cublai, gran kan de' Tartari'' (''Kublai Grand Kahn of Tartary'') a satire on the autocracy and court intrigues at the court of the Russian [[Tsarina]], [[Catherine the Great]], and ''[[Catilina (opera)|Catilina]]'' a semi-comic-semi-tragic account of the [[Lucius Sergius Catilina|Catiline]] conspiracy that attempted to overthrow the Roman republic during the consulship of [[Cicero]]. These operas were composed in 1787 and 1792 respectively. Two other operas of little success and longterm importance were composed in 1789, and one great popular success ''[[La cifra]]'' (''The Cipher'').\n\n[[File:Palmira, regina di Persia.jpg|thumb|300px|The beginning of Salieri's opera ''Palmira, regina di Persia'']]\nAs Salieri's political position became very insecure he was retired as director of the Italian opera in 1792. He continued to write new operas per imperial contract until 1804, when he voluntarily withdrew from the stage. Of his late works for the stage only two works gained wide popular esteem during his life, ''[[Palmira, regina di Persia]]'' (Palmira, queen of Persia) 1795 and ''{{ill|Cesare in Farmacusa|de}}'' (Caesar on [[Farmakonisi|Pharmacusa]]), both drawing on the heroic and exotic success established with ''Axur''. His late opera based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff ossia Le tre burle]]'' (Falstaff, or the three tricks) (1799) has found a wider audience in modern times than its original reception promised. His last opera was a German-language singspiel ''{{ill|Die Neger|de|Die Neger (Oper)}}'' (The negroes), a [[melodrama]] set in [[colonial Virginia]] with a text by [[Georg Friedrich Treitschke]] (the author of the libretto for Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'') performed in 1804 and was a complete failure.\n\n===Life after opera (1804\u20131825)===\nWhen Salieri retired from the stage, he recognized that artistic styles had changed and he felt that he no longer had the creative capacity to adapt or the emotional desire to continue. Also as Salieri aged he moved slowly away from his more liberal political stances as he saw the enlightened reform of Joseph II's reign, and the hoped for reforms of the French revolution, replaced with more radical revolutionary ideas. As the political situation threatened and eventually overwhelmed Austria, which was repeatedly crushed by French political forces, Salieri's first and most important biographer {{Interlanguage link multi|Ignaz Franz von Mosel|de|3=Ignaz Franz von Mosel|lt=Mosel}} described the emotional effect that this political, social, and cultural upheaval had on the composer. Mosel noted that these radical changes, especially the invasion and defeat of Austria, and the occupation of Vienna intertwined with the personal losses that struck Salieri in the same period led to his withdrawal from operatic work. Related to this Mosel quotes the aged composer concerning the radical changes in musical taste that were underway in the age of Beethoven, \"From that period [circa 1800] I realized that musical taste was gradually changing in a manner completely contrary to that of my own times. Eccentricity and confusion of genres replaced reasoned and masterful simplicity.\"<ref>Rice, pp. 596\u201397</ref>\n\nAs his teaching and work with the imperial chapel continued, his duties required the composition of a large number of sacred works, and in his last years it was almost exclusively in religious works and teaching that Salieri occupied himself. Among his compositions written for the chapel were two complete sets of vespers, many graduals, offertories, and four orchestral masses. During this period he lost his only son in 1805 and his wife in 1807.\n\nSalieri continued to conduct publicly, including the performance on 18 March 1808 of [[Haydn]]'s ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' during which Haydn collapsed, and several premieres by Beethoven including the 1st and 2nd Piano Concertos and ''[[Wellington's Victory]]''. He also continued to help administer several charities and organize their musical events.\n\nHis remaining secular works in this late period fall into three categories: first, large scale cantatas and one oratorio ''Habsburg'' written on patriotic themes or in response to the international political situation, pedagogical works written to aid his students in voice, and finally simple songs, rounds or canons written for home entertainment; many with original poetry by the composer. He also composed one large scale instrumental work in 1815 intended as a study in late classical orchestration: Twenty-Six Variations for the Orchestra on a Theme called La Folia di Spagna. The theme is likely folk derived and is known as ''[[Folia|La Fol\u00eda]]''. This simple melodic and harmonic progression had served as an inspiration for many baroque composers, and would be used by later romantic and post-romantic composers. Salieri's setting is a brooding work in the minor key, which rarely moves far from the original melodic material, its main interest lies in the deft and varied handling of orchestral colors. ''La Folia'' was the most monumental set of orchestral variations before [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]''.\n\nHis teaching of budding young musicians continued, and among his pupils in composition (usually vocal) were [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Antonio Casimir Cartellieri]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]] and many other luminaries of the early Romantic period. {{See LMST|Antonio|Salieri}} He also instructed many prominent singers throughout his long career, including [[Caterina Canzi]]. All but the wealthiest of his pupils received their lessons for free, a tribute to the kindness Gassmann had shown Salieri as a penniless orphan.\n\nSalieri was committed to medical care and suffered [[dementia]] for the last year and a half of his life{{according to whom|date=January 2015}}. He died in Vienna on 7 May 1825, aged 74 and was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof on 10&nbsp;May. At his memorial service on 22 June 1825 his own Requiem in C minor&nbsp;\u2013 composed in 1804 \u2013 was performed for the first time. His remains were later transferred to the [[Zentralfriedhof]]. His monument is adorned by a poem written by [[Joseph Weigl]], one of his pupils:\n\n:{|\n|<poem>Rest in peace! Uncovered by dust\nEternity shall bloom for you.\nRest in peace! In eternal harmonies\nYour spirit now is set free.\nIt expressed itself in enchanting notes,\nNow it is floating to everlasting beauty.</poem>\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|<poem>{{Lang|de|Ruh sanft!

Among the most successful of his 37 operas staged during his lifetime were ''[[Armida (Salieri)|Armida]]'' (1771), ''[[La fiera di Venezia]]'' (1772), ''[[La scuola de' gelosi]]'' (1778), ''[[Der Rauchfangkehrer]]'' (1781), ''[[Les Dana\u00efdes]]'' (1784), which was first presented as a work of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]], ''[[La grotta di Trofonio]]'' (1785), ''[[Tarare (opera)|Tarare]]'' (1787) (''Tarare'' was reworked and revised several times as was ''Les Dana\u00efdes'' ), ''[[Axur, re d'Ormus]]'' (1788), ''[[La cifra]]'' (1789), ''[[Palmira, regina di Persia]]'' (1795), ''Il mondo alla rovescia'' (1795), ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]'' (1799), and ''Cesare in Farmacusa'' (1800).\n\n===Sacred works===\nSalieri's earliest surviving work is a Mass in C major. He would write four major orchestral masses, a requiem, and many offertories, graduals, vesper settings, and sacred cantatas and oratorios. Much of his sacred music dates from after his appointment as Hofkapellmeister in 1788.\n\n===Instrumental works===\nHis small instrumental output includes two [[Piano concerto|piano concerti]], a concerto for [[organ (music)|organ]] written in 1773, a concerto for [[flute]], [[oboe]] and orchestra (1774), a triple concerto for oboe, violin and cello, and a set of twenty-six variations on ''[[La follia di Spagna]]'' (1815).\n\n==Interaction with Mozart==\nIn the 1780s, while [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] lived and worked in Vienna, he and his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] wrote in their letters that several \"cabals\" of Italians led by Salieri were actively putting obstacles in the way of Mozart's obtaining certain posts or staging his operas. For example, Mozart wrote in December 1781 to his father that \"the only one who counts in [the Emperor's] eyes is Salieri\".<ref>Spaethling, p. 294</ref> Their letters suggest that both Mozart and his father, being Austrians who resented the special place that Italian composers had in the courts of the Austrian princes, blamed the Italians in general and Salieri in particular for all of Mozart's difficulties in establishing himself in Vienna. Mozart wrote to his father in May 1783 about Salieri and [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], the court poet: \"You know those Italian gentlemen; they are very nice to your face! Enough, we all know about them. And if [Da Ponte] is in league with Salieri, I'll never get a text from him, and I would love to show here what I can really do with an Italian opera.\"<ref>''Mozart's Letters'', Little, Brown & Co, London, 1990 pp. 184\u20135 .</ref> In July 1783 Mozart wrote to his father of \"a trick of Salieri's\",<ref>Spaethling p. 357</ref> one of several letters in which he accused Salieri of trickery. Decades after Mozart's death, a rumour began to circulate that Mozart had been poisoned by Salieri. This rumour has been attributed by some to a rivalry between the German and the Italian schools of music.<ref>{{cite news | title=For Mozart's Arch rival, an Italian Renaissance | author=Jason Horowitz | date=28 December 2004 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/arts/music/28sali.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref> [[Carl Maria von Weber]], a relative of Mozart by marriage<ref>Braunbehrens, p. 5. \"Apparently Weber, who could claim family ties with Mozart, believed the rumors.\"</ref> whom Wagner has characterized as the most German of German composers, is said to have refused to join {{ill|Ludlamsh\u00f6hle|de}} (Ludlam's cave), a social club of which Salieri was a member, and avoided having anything to do with him.<ref>Braunbehrens, p. 220. \"Carl Maria von Weber was also invited to join the society, but is said to have refused as long as Salieri was a member.\"</ref> These rumours then made their way into popular culture. [[Albert Lortzing]]'s ''Singspiel'' ''Szenen aus Mozarts Leben'' LoWV28 (1832) uses the clich\u00e9 of the jealous Salieri trying to hinder Mozart's career.\n\nIronically, Salieri's music was much more in the tradition of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and Gassmann than of the Italians like [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]] or [[Domenico Cimarosa|Cimarosa]]. In 1772, Empress [[Maria Theresa]] commented on her preference of Italian composers over Germans like Gassmann, Salieri or Gluck. While Italian by birth, Salieri had lived in imperial Vienna for almost 60 years and was regarded by such people as the music critic Friedrich Rochlitz as a German composer.<ref>{{cite news | title=See his obituary reprinted in Alexander Wheelock Thayer, Salieri: Rival of Mozart (Kansas City 1989) }}</ref>\n\nThe biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] believes that Mozart's rivalry with Salieri could have originated with an incident in 1781, when Mozart applied to be the music teacher of [[Duchess Elisabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg|Princess Elisabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg]], and Salieri was selected instead because of his reputation as a singing teacher. In the following year Mozart once again failed to be selected as the Princess' piano teacher.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abert|first=Hermann|author2=Spencer, Stewart|author3= Eisen, Cliff|title=W. A.

In addition, when [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] was in [[Prague]] preparing the production of Mozart's setting of his ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', the poet was ordered back to Vienna for a royal wedding for which Salieri's ''Axur, re d'Ormus'' would be performed. Obviously, Mozart was not pleased by this.\n\nHowever, even with Mozart and Salieri's rivalry for certain jobs, there is very little evidence that the relationship between the two composers was at all acrimonious beyond this, especially after 1785 or so, when Mozart had become established in Vienna. Rather, they appeared to usually see each other as friends and colleagues, and supported each other's work. For example, when Salieri was appointed Kapellmeister in 1788, he revived ''Figaro'' instead of bringing out a new opera of his own, and when he went to the coronation festivities for Leopold II in 1790, Salieri had no fewer than three Mozart masses in his luggage. Salieri and Mozart even composed a cantata for voice and piano together, called ''[[Per la ricuperata salute di Ofelia]]'', which celebrated the return to stage of the singer [[Nancy Storace]]. This work, although it had been printed by [[Artaria]] in 1785, was considered [[Lost work|lost]] until 10 January 2016, when the ''[[Schw\u00e4bische Zeitung]]'' reported on the discovery, by musicologist and composer [[Timo Jouko Herrmann]], of a copy of its text and music while doing research on Antonio Salieri in the collections of the Czech Museum of Music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Mozart Composition for Nancy Storace Rediscovered |url=http://www.mozarteum.at/en/content/news/276|publisher=The Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>About the edition of this work see more Luk\u00e1\u0161 M.

This revival was due to the dramatic and highly fictionalized depiction of Salieri in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus]]'' (1979), which was given its greatest exposure in its [[Amadeus (film)|1984 film version]], directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]. His music today has regained some modest popularity via recordings. It is also the subject of increasing academic study, and a small number of his operas have returned to the stage. In addition, there is now a Salieri Opera Festival sponsored by the Fondazione Culturale Antonio Salieri and dedicated to rediscovering his work and those of his contemporaries. It is developing as an annual autumn event in his native town of Legnago, where a theatre has been renamed in his honour.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellone&tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival|title=Salieri Opera Festival| website=Teatro Salieri| language=Italian| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232139/http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellone&tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival| archivedate=6 June 2010| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Modern performances of Salieri's work===\nIn 2003, [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Cecilia Bartoli]] released ''The Salieri Album'', a CD with 13 arias from Salieri's operas, most of which had never been recorded before. Patrice Michaels sang a number of his arias on the CD ''Divas of Mozart's Day''. In 2008, another female opera star, [[Diana Damrau]], released a CD with seven Salieri coloratura arias. Since 2000, there have also been complete recordings issued or re-issued of the operas ''Axur Re d'Ormus'', ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]'', ''[[Les Dana\u00efdes]]'', ''La Locandiera'', ''[[La grotta di Trofonio]]'', ''[[Prima la musica e poi le parole]]'' and ''{{ill|Il mondo alla rovescia|de}}''. Salieri has yet to fully re-enter the general repertory, but performances of his works are progressively becoming more regular.\n\nHis operas ''Falstaff'' (1995 production from the [[Schwetzingen Festival]]) and ''[[Tarare (opera)|Tarare]]'' (1987 production, also from the Schwetzingen Festival) have been released on DVD. In 2004, the opera ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]'' was staged in Milan for the reopening of [[La Scala]] in Milan, with soprano [[Diana Damrau]] in the title role. This production was also broadcast on television.\n\nIn November 2009, ''Il mondo alla rovescia'' was given its first staging in modern times at the Teatro Salieri in Legnago in a co-production between the Fondazione Culturale Antonio Salieri and the Fondazione Arena di Verona for the Salieri Opera Festival.<ref>[http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellonedett&tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival&page=0&id=3233 ''Il mondo alla rovescia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055405/http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellonedett&tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival&page=0&id=3233 |date=22 July 2011 }}, Teatro Salieri \u2013 Salieri Opera Festival on teatrosalieri.it</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2011 in Graz, Austria, the hometown of the librettist [[Leopold Auenbrugger]], Salieri's ''Der Rauchfangkehrer'' was given its first modern production. In July 2014 there was another modern production of this Salieri opera. This time it was the [[Pinchgut Opera]] of Sydney, Australia, performing it as ''The Chimneysweep''.<ref>{{cite web|\n title=The Chimney Sweep| url=http://www.pinchgutopera.com.au/the-chimney-sweep/| publisher=Pinchgut Opera| date=2014}}</ref> ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' referred to it as the discovery of \"a long-forgotten treasure\".<ref>{{cite news| title=Pinchgut Opera rediscovers a long-forgotten treasure| first=Harriet | last=Cunningham| url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/opera/pinchgut-opera-rediscovers-a-longforgotten-treasure-20140706-zsxya.html| date=July 6, 2014| newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate=February 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Use of music by Salieri in films===\nSalieri has even begun to attract some attention from Hollywood. In 2001, his triple concerto was used in the soundtrack of ''[[The Last Castle]]'', featuring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini. It is a story that builds on the rivalry between a meticulous but untested officer (Gandolfini) serving as the warden of a military prison and an imprisoned but much admired and highly decorated general (Redford). The Salieri piece is used as the warden's theme music, seemingly to invoke the image of jealousy of the inferior for his superior. In 2006, the movie ''[[Copying Beethoven]]'' referred to Salieri in a more positive light. In this movie a young female music student hired by Beethoven to copy out his Ninth Symphony is staying at a monastery. The abbess tries to discourage her from working with the irreverent Beethoven. She notes that she too once had dreams, having come to Vienna to study opera singing with Salieri. The 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' used the Larghetto movement from Salieri's Piano Concerto in C major. The scene where Obadiah Stane, the archrival of Tony Stark, the wealthy industrialist turned Iron Man, tells Tony that he is being ousted from his company by the board, Obadiah plays the opening few bars of the Salieri concerto on a piano in Stark's suite.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Fictional treatments===\nSalieri's life, and especially his relationship with Mozart, has been a subject of many stories, in a variety of media.\n*Within a few years of Salieri's death in 1825, [[Alexander Pushkin]] wrote his \"little tragedy\" ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'' (1831), as a dramatic study of the sin of [[envy]].\n*In 1898, Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] adapted Pushkin's play, ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'' (1831), as an [[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|opera of the same name]].\n*A hugely popular yet heavily fictionalized perpetuation of the story came in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus]]'' (1979) and its [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning [[Amadeus (film)|1984 film adaptation]] directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]. Salieri was portrayed in the award-winning play at London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] by [[Paul Scofield]] and in the film by [[F. Murray Abraham]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the part. Abraham depicts Salieri as a [[Machiavellian]], [[Iago]]-esque character, who uses his connections to keep Mozart as the underdog and slowly destroy Mozart's career. The play does not portray Salieri as a murderer but rather has him hastening Mozart's demise through a series of plots, leaving him destitute.<ref>Grubert, Gernot \"The Mozart Myths\" (Stanford, CA. Stanford University Press, 1991)</ref> Salieri is characterized as both in awe of and insanely envious of Mozart, going so far as to renounce God for blessing his adversary; \"Amadeus\" means love of God, or God's love, and the play can be said to be about God-given talent, or the lack thereof: Salieri is hospitalized in a mental institution, where he announces himself as \"the [[patron saint]] of mediocrity\".\n*Salieri's supposed hatred for Mozart is also alluded to in a [[parody|spoof]] opera titled ''[[A Little Nightmare Music]]'' (1982), by [[P.D.Q. Bach]]. In the opera, Salieri attempts to [[poison]] an [[anachronism|anachronistic]] Shaffer but is bumped by a \"clumsy oaf\", which causes him to inadvertently poison Mozart instead and spill wine on his favorite coat.\n*[[Patrick Stewart]] played Salieri in the 1985 production ''The Mozart Inquest''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Klossner| first=Michael| title=The Europe of 1500\u20131815 on film and television: a worldwide filmography of over 2550 works, 1895 through 2000| publisher=McFarland & Co| year=2002| page=267| isbn=978-0-7864-1223-5}}</ref>\n*[[Florent Mothe]] portrays Salieri in the French musical ''[[Mozart, l'op\u00e9ra rock]]'' (2009).\n* C.

It was built mainly to satisfy public demand for creation of a [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right of way]] for the [[Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad]] (later Long Island Rail Road) on its way to the [[South Ferry, Brooklyn|South Ferry]] at the foot of Atlantic Street (later Atlantic Avenue), where passengers could catch ferries to [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"BHRA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.net/images/aa_tunnel/new_research/oct_09/events_leading_to_tunnel_creation.pdf|title=Events That Led to the Creation of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel|publisher=Brooklyn Historic Railway Association|accessdate=October 29, 2009}}</ref> The construction of the cutting also lowered the LIRR's grade through [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]]. Around five years after opening the cutting was roofed over, converting it into a tunnel.\n\nIn exchange for building the cutting, the [[City of Brooklyn]] granted the B&J permission to operate its steam locomotives on Atlantic Street west of Fifth Avenue (then Parmentier's Garden/Gowanus Lane), all the way to Brooklyn's South Ferry (the present location of Brooklyn's Pier 7). Prior to the cutting being built, the LIRR's western terminus was Atlantic Street at Clinton Street. Train cars were hauled by teams of horses along Atlantic Street from Clinton Street to Parmentier's Garden, where steam locomotives were attached. While the cutting was being built, the railroad operated to a temporary terminal at Pacific Street and Henry Street.\n\nThe Cobble Hill Tunnel was part of the first rail link between New York City and [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The railroad connected [[Lower Manhattan]] via the South Ferry to [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]] on the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of [[Long Island]], where a ferry connected to [[Stonington, Connecticut]], where a rail link continued to Boston. This avoided some difficult construction of bridges over the rivers of southern [[Connecticut]]. In 1848, the [[New York and New Haven Railroad]] Line was completed through Connecticut, providing a direct, faster rail connection from New York City to Boston. The Cobble Hill Tunnel and the Long Island Railroad remained the primary means of access to most of central Long Island from Manhattan and New York City. As originally built, the cutting was {{convert|21|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|2517|ft|m}} long. Once roofed over the interior height of the newly created tunnel was {{convert|17|ft|m}}.\n\nThe ends of the tunnel were sealed in the fall of 1861. The similar [[Murray Hill Tunnel]] on the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] was built as an open cut around 1836, roofed over around the 1850s, and is now in use for automobile traffic.\n\n== Closure controversy ==\nIn 1861, the [[New York State Legislature]] voted to ban railroad locomotives from within the limits of the [[City of Brooklyn]]. A tax assessment was ordered on all property owners along Atlantic Street (today Atlantic Avenue), to defray the costs of the closure. It was undisclosed at the time that [[New York State]] Governor [[John A. King]] was a major [[shareholder]] in the Brooklyn and [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] Railroad (later the [[Long Island Rail Road]]) and therefore had a conflict of interest and stood to benefit by the compensation payments to the railroad from the tax assessment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n== Dormancy ==\n[[Walt Whitman]] wrote of the tunnel:<ref name=CB>{{cite web|title=Crossing Brooklyn LIRR Tunnel |work=Forgotten NY |url=http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/tunnel/tunnel.html |accessdate=February 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226062020/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/tunnel/tunnel.html |archivedate=December 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n<blockquote>The old tunnel, that used to lie there under ground, a passage of [[Acheron]]-like solemnity and darkness, now all closed and filled up, and soon to be utterly forgotten, with all its reminiscences; however, there will, for a few years yet be many dear ones, to not a few Brooklynites, New Yorkers, and promiscuous crowds besides. For it was here you started to go down the island, in summer. For years, it was confidently counted on that this spot, and the railroad of which it was the terminus, were going to prove the permanent seat of business and wealth that belong to such enterprises. But its glory, after enduring in great splendor for a season, has now vanished\u2014at least its Long Island Railroad glory has. The tunnel: dark as the grave, cold, damp, and silent. How beautiful look earth and heaven again, as we emerge from the gloom! It might not be unprofitable, now and then, to send us mortals\u2014the dissatisfied ones, at least, and that's a large proportion\u2014into some tunnel of several days' journey. We'd perhaps grumble less, afterward, at God's handiwork.</blockquote>\n\nIn March 1916, the [[FBI|Bureau of Investigation]] suspected German terrorists were making bombs in the tunnel, and broke through the roof of the tunnel with jackhammers. They found nothing, installed an electric light, and resealed it. In the 1920s, it was rumored used for both mushroom growing and bootleg whiskey stills, even though there was no access into the main portion of the tunnel. It became an object of local folklore and legend. In 1936, the [[New York City Police Department]] unsuccessfully attempted to enter the tunnel, in order to look for the body of a hoodlum supposedly buried there. In 1941, it was rumored to have been inspected by the federal [[Works Progress Administration]] to determine its structural strength, but there is no evidence of this. A few years later, it was once again rumored to have been opened, this time by the FBI, in an unsuccessful search for spies; however, there is no evidence of this. During the late 1950s, it was sought by two rail historians, George Horn and Martin Schachne, but they did not gain access to the tunnel itself.\n\n== Rediscovery ==\nHaving fallen from public notice, the tunnel was rediscovered in 1980 by then 20-year-old Robert Diamond,<ref name=theverge /> who entered from a manhole he located at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street, crawled a distance of {{convert|70|ft|m}} underground through a filled-in section of tunnel less than two feet high, and located the bulkhead wall that sealed off the main portion of the tunnel. With the assistance of a Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (now [[KeySpan|National Grid]]) engineering crew, he then broke through the massive concrete bulkhead wall, which is several feet thick. Diamond thereby opened access to the main portion of the tunnel, and began to popularize the tunnel as an antiquity. He led tours of its interior<ref name=CB /> from 1982 until December 17, 2010,<ref>[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Brooklyn-Underground-Tunnel-Tours-Are-Now-Six-Feet-Under-112103379.html NBC.com]</ref> when the [[New York State Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] terminated his contract, citing safety concerns.<ref name=theverge>[https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5280920/tunnel-vision-bob-diamond-fights-for-the-atlantic-avenue-subway Tunnel vision: how an obsessed explorer found and lost the world's oldest subway]</ref> The tunnel has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1989.\n\nThe [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series ''[[Cities of the Underworld]]'' ran a segment (\"New York's Secret Societies\") on the tunnel in Fall 2008. The TV show ''[[Treasure Hunters (TV series)#Leg 4 (Massachusetts \u2192 New York \u2192 South Carolina \u2192 Georgia)|Treasure Hunters]]'' used it in an episode.{{citation needed|date=July

[[Statistics Canada]] defines the Annapolis Valley as an economic region, composed of [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis County]], [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings County]], and [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\n[[Image:Annapolis Valley from lookoff1.JPG|200px|thumb|left|View of the Annapolis Valley as viewed from [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] looking southeast from Valleyview Provincial Park, north of [[Bridgetown, Nova Scotia|Bridgetown]], in October 2005.]]\nThe valley measures approximately {{convert|126|km|mi}} in length from [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] and the [[Annapolis Basin]] in the west to [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]] and the [[Minas Basin]] in the east, spanning the counties of [[Digby County, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis]] and [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings]].\n\nSome also include the western part of [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]], including the towns of [[Hantsport, Nova Scotia|Hantsport]] and [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] even further to the east, but geographically speaking they are part of the [[Avon River (Nova Scotia)|Avon River]] valley.\n\nThe steep face of basaltic [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] shelters the valley from the adjacent Bay of Fundy and rises over {{convert|260|m|ft}} in elevation near [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101617/http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}</ref>  The granitic [[South Mountain (Nova Scotia)|South Mountain]] rises to a somewhat higher elevation and shelters the valley from the climate of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 100 kilometres further south on the province's [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]].\n\nThe shelter provided by these two mountainous ridges has produced a \"micro climate\" which provides relatively mild temperatures for the region and, coupled with the fertile glacial sedimentary soils on the valley floor, the region is conducive to growing vegetable and fruit crops.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Particularly famous for its apple crop, the valley hosts in excess of 1,000 farms of various types, the majority being relatively small family-owned operations.\n\nWithin the valley itself are two \"major\" rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] which flows west from the Caribou Bog in the central part of the valley into the [[Annapolis Basin]], and the [[Cornwallis River]] which flows east from Caribou Bog into the [[Minas Basin]]. The [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] ridge forms the north side of the Annapolis Valley. Also flowing east, in two smaller valleys north of the Cornwallis River, are the Canard River and the Habitant River, both of which also flow into the Minas Basin.\n[[File:Road to Blomidon Provincial Park.jpg|thumb|1020px|center|Eastern End.

From there, the Acadians spread throughout the Valley, in various communities, building dykes to claim the tidal lands along the Annapolis and Cornwallis Rivers. They continued throughout the Annapolis Valley until the British-ordered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expulsion]] of [[Acadian]]s in 1755 which is memorialized at [[Grand Pre, Nova Scotia|Grand Pr\u00e9]] in the eastern part of the valley.  [[New England Planters]] moved in to occupy the abandoned Acadian farming areas and the region also saw subsequent settlement by [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalist]] refugees of the [[American Revolutionary War]], as well as foreign Protestants. These were followed by significant numbers of freed Africans in the [[War of 1812]], Irish immigrants in the mid-19th century and Dutch immigrants after [[World War II]]. Agriculture in the Annapolis valley boomed in the late 19th century with the arrival of the [[Windsor and Annapolis Railway]], later the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], which developed large export markets for Annapolis Valley apples.\n\nThe [[Annapolis Valley Regional Library]] was established in 1949. It was the first regional library system in Nova Scotia.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About the Library : Annapolis Valley Regional Library|url = http://www.valleylibrary.ca/about-library|website = www.valleylibrary.ca|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[File:Grafton, Nova Scotia.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Corn growing at [[Grafton, Nova Scotia|Grafton]] in the Annapolis Valley in October 2011]]\nThe Valley has traditionally been built on a diversified agricultural industry, with a wide range of output ranging from livestock to fruit trees and berries. The last quarter century has also seen the development of a wine industry, with such notable wineries as [[Gaspereau Vineyards]] winning national and international awards for their produce.\n\nToday, the Valley is still largely dominated by agriculture but also has a growing diversity in its economies, partly aided by the importance of post-secondary education centres provided by [[Acadia University]] in Wolfville, and the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] campuses located in [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]], [[Middleton, Nova Scotia|Middleton]], [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]], and [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]].\n\n[[Michelin]] has an important truck tire manufacturing plant in [[Waterville, Nova Scotia|Waterville]] and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] has its largest [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]] base in [[Atlantic Canada]] located at [[CFB Greenwood]] along with an important training facility at [[Land Force Atlantic Area Training Centre Aldershot | Camp Aldershot]], near Kentville.\n\nTourism is also an important industry and the Annapolis Valley is known for its scenic farmland, although today some is threatened with suburban development in the eastern end, and a great deal has been abandoned. The valley also struggles with pollution from farm runoffs and residential sewers in its two major rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] and the [[Cornwallis River]]. The Annapolis Valley additionally has become home to the majority of Nova Scotia wineries, located in either the Gaspereau Valley or in the Canning, Grand Pr\u00e9, or Bear River areas.<ref>http://winesofnovascotia.ca/</ref>\n\nThe Valley is home to the annual [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival|Apple Blossom Festival]], held in late spring. In July is the annual Steer Bar-B-Que in Kingston, and Heart of the Valley Festival in Middleton. August sees Mud Creek Days in Wolfville and the Annapolis Valley Exhibition in Lawrencetown. Bridgetown's Cider Festival comes in mid-September. The Canadian Deep Roots Music Festival is held each year at the end of September in Wolfville, a community-based festival, supported by both The Town of Wolfville and Acadia University and built on countless hours of volunteerism by a stable base of over 100 volunteers, and on in-kind and financial support from virtually all sectors of the Valley community. Late October sees Wolfville and Kings County play host to [[Devour! The Food Film Fest|Devour The Food Film Fest]], an annual international film festival celebrating all things culinary. Farmers markets in Annapolis Royal, Bridgetown, Middleton, Kentville, Kingsport, Berwick and Wolfville bring a wealth of fresh produce and other fine goods to the public every week. In the fall the Pumpkin People in Kentville entice the imagination.\n[[File:Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia.jpg|1020px|thumb|center|The Lawrencetown Exhibition in early August.]]\n\n==Communities==\nCommunities in the Valley from west to east include:\n\nBolded communities are major communities\n\n*'''[[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]]'''\n*[[Cornwallis, Nova Scotia|Cornwallis]]\n*'''[[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]]'''\n*'''[[Bridgetown, Nova Scotia|Bridgetown]]'''\n*'''[[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]]'''\n*'''[[Middleton, Nova Scotia|Middleton]]'''\n*'''[[Greenwood, Nova Scotia|Greenwood]]'''\n*'''[[Kingston, Nova Scotia|Kingston]]'''\n*[[Auburn, Nova Scotia|Auburn]]\n*'''[[Aylesford, Nova Scotia|Aylesford]]'''\n*'''[[Berwick, Nova Scotia|Berwick]]'''\n*[[Waterville, Nova Scotia|Waterville]]\n*[[Cambridge, Kings County, Nova Scotia|Cambridge]]\n*[[Coldbrook, Nova Scotia|Coldbrook]]\n*'''[[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]]'''\n*'''[[New Minas, Nova Scotia|New Minas]]'''\n*'''[[Canning, Nova Scotia|Canning]]'''\n*'''[[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]]'''\n*[[Grand Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand Pr\u00e9]]\n*[[Hantsport]]\n*[[Mount Denson, Nova Scotia|Mount Denson]]\n*[[Falmouth, Nova Scotia|Falmouth]]\n*'''[[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]]'''\n\n{{coord|45|00|N|64|55|W|source:CGNDB_scale:1000000|display=title}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Annapolis Valley}}\n{{commons|Annapolis Valley}}\n*[http://www.valleytourism.ca/ Annapolis Valley Tourism]\n\n{{Subdivisions of Nova Scotia}}\n\n[[Category:Valleys of Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Annapolis Valley|*]]\n[[Category:Wine regions of Canada]]\n[[Category:Geographic regions of Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of Nova Scotia]]", "sha1": "1dkwcybdewo4xwlkpw93408awotxo1z"}}, {"title": "Analgesic", "ns": "0", "id": "2246", "revision": {"id": "866158239", "parentid": "865914289", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T17:23:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "JCW-CleanerBot", "id": "31737083"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* List of drugs with comparison */[[User:JCW-CleanerBot#Logic|task]], replaced: journal = Clinical pharmacokinetics \u2192 journal = Clinical Pharmacokinetics (2)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Painkiller}}\n[[File:Opium pod cut to demonstrate fluid extraction1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papaver somniferum|Opium poppies]] such as this one provide ingredients for the class of analgesics called [[opiate]]s]]\nAn '''analgesic''' or '''painkiller''' is any member of the group of [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] used to achieve analgesia, relief from [[pain]].\n\nAnalgesic drugs act in various ways on the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system|central]] nervous systems.

The [[cyclooxygenase]] enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered to have at least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2.  Research suggested most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 ([[Constitutive enzyme|constitutive]]) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 ([[Adaptive enzyme|inducible]]) enzyme.  Thus, the COX2 inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).

Opioid tolerance is often addressed with [[opioid rotation|opioid rotation therapy]] in which a patient is routinely switched between two or more non-cross-tolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect.\n\n===Alcohol===\n{{see also|Ethanol}}\nDescribing the effects of using alcohol to treat pain is difficult.<ref name=\"ZaleMaisto2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Zale|first1=Emily L.|last2=Maisto|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Ditre|first3=Joseph W.|title=Interrelations between pain and alcohol: An integrative review|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=37|year=2015|pages=57\u201371|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.02.005|pmid=25766100|pmc=4385458}}</ref> Alcohol has biological, mental, and social effects which influence the consequences of using alcohol for pain.<ref name=\"ZaleMaisto2015\"/> Moderate use of alcohol can lessen certain types of pain in certain circumstances.<ref name=\"ZaleMaisto2015\"/> Attempting to use alcohol to treat pain has also been observed to lead to negative outcomes including excessive drinking and [[alcohol use disorder]].<ref name=\"ZaleMaisto2015\"/>\n\n===Medical cannabis===\n{{main|Medical cannabis}}\nMedical cannabis or medical marijuana, can refer to the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and its [[cannabinoids]] to treat disease or improve symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Murnion|first1=B|title=Medicinal cannabis.|journal=Australian prescriber|date=December 2015|volume=38|issue=6|pages=212\u20135|pmid=26843715|doi=10.18773/austprescr.2015.072|pmc=4674028}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is medical marijuana?|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana-medicine|website=National Institute of Drug Abuse|accessdate=19 April 2016|date=July 2015|quote=The term medical marijuana refers to using the whole unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat a disease or symptom.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417154854/https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana-medicine|archivedate=17 April 2016|df=}}</ref>  There is evidence suggesting that cannabis can be used to treat [[chronic pain]] and [[muscle spasms]]; with some trials indicating improved relief of neuropathic pain over opioids.<ref name=Borgelt2013>{{cite journal|last1=Borgelt|first1=LM|last2=Franson|first2=KL|last3=Nussbaum|first3=AM|last4=Wang|first4=GS|title=The pharmacologic and clinical effects of medical cannabis.|journal=Pharmacotherapy|date=February 2013|volume=33|issue=2|pages=195\u2013209|pmid=23386598|doi=10.1002/phar.1187}}</ref><ref name=JAMA2015>{{cite journal|last1=Whiting|first1=PF|last2=Wolff|first2=RF|last3=Deshpande|first3=S|last4=Di Nisio|first4=M|last5=Duffy|first5=S|last6=Hernandez|first6=AV|last7=Keurentjes|first7=JC|last8=Lang|first8=S|last9=Misso|first9=K|last10=Ryder|first10=S|last11=Schmidlkofer|first11=S|last12=Westwood|first12=M|last13=Kleijnen|first13=J|title=Cannabinoids for Medical Use: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA|date=23 June 2015|volume=313|issue=24|pages=2456\u20132473|doi=10.1001/jama.2015.6358|pmid=26103030|hdl=10757/558499|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/journals/jama/934167/joi150059.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921232733/http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/journals/jama/934167/joi150059.pdf|archivedate=21 September 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Bjorn|last2=Chen|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Furnish|first3=Tim|last4=Wallace|first4=Mark|title=Medical Marijuana and Chronic Pain: a Review of Basic Science and Clinical Evidence|journal=Current Pain and Headache Reports|date=1 September 2015|volume=19|issue=10|doi=10.1007/s11916-015-0524-x}}</ref>\n\n=== Combinations ===\n\nAnalgesics are frequently used in combination, such as the [[paracetamol]] and [[codeine]] preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers.

Both first-generation (such as [[amitriptyline]]) and newer anti-depressants (such as [[duloxetine]]) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems.  Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]], [[carisoprodol]], or [[tripelennamine]] to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.\n\nAdjuvant analgesics, also called atypical analgesics, include [[nefopam]], [[orphenadrine]], [[pregabalin]], [[gabapentin]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[hyoscine]] (scopolamine), and other drugs possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, as well as many other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.\n\n[[Dextromethorphan]] has been noted to slow the development of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the [[NMDA]] receptors;{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} some analgesics such as [[methadone]] and [[ketobemidone]] and perhaps [[piritramide]] have intrinsic NMDA action.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dextromethorphan shows efficacy in experimental pain (nociception) and opioid tolerance|publisher=NEUROLOGY, 2005|author1=K.

As such, in general, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.\n\nThe use of [[adjuvant]] analgesics is an important and growing part of the pain-control field and new discoveries are made practically every year.  Many of these drugs combat the side-effects of opioid analgesics, an added bonus.  For example, [[antihistamines]] including orphenadrine combat the release of histamine caused by many opioids. Stimulants such as [[methylphenidate]], [[caffeine]], [[ephedrine]], [[dextroamphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[cocaine]] work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed patients as do the antidepressants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} The use of medicinal [[cannabis]] remains a debated issue.\n\nIn patients with chronic or neuropathic pain, various other substances may have analgesic properties.  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s, especially [[clomipramine]] and [[amitriptyline]], have been shown to improve pain in what appears to be a central manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Nefopam is used in Europe for pain relief with concurrent opioids. The exact mechanism of [[carbamazepine]], [[gabapentin]], and [[pregabalin]] is similarly unclear, but these [[anticonvulsant]]s are used to treat neuropathic pain with differing degrees of success.
