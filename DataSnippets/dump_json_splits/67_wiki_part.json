The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Kerguelen Island at {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the {{convert|1232|km|abbr=on}} of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.\n[[File:Kerguelen VolcanDuDiable.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kerguelen Islands]] \u2013 The Volcan du Diable.]]\n\nThe islands in the Indian Ocean are supplied by the special ship ''[[Marion Dufresne (1995)|Marion Dufresne]]'' sailing out of [[Le Port, R\u00e9union|Le Port]] in [[R\u00e9union Island]].

This fleet is maintained as a subset of the French register that allows French-owned ships to operate under more liberal taxation and manning regulations than permissible under the main French register.

Economic activity is limited to servicing [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.\n\nThe main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]] and occasionally other services patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.\n\nFrance used to sell licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from R\u00e9union Island.\n\nThe territory takes in revenues of about [[euro|\u20ac]]16 million a year.\n\n== Codes ==\n\nThe French Southern Territories (i.e. the TAAF excluding Ad\u00e9lie Land) have been given the following [[country code]]s: FS ([[List of FIPS country codes|FIPS]]) and [[ISO 3166-2:TF|TF]] ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]).\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Geography|Africa|<!--East Africa-->|<!--Indian Ocean-->|France|<!--French Southern and Antarctic Lands-->}}\n* [[France]]\n* [[Outline of France]]\n* <!-- [[Index of France-related articles]] -->\n* <!-- [[Bibliography of France]] -->\n* <!-- {{wikipedia books link|France}} -->\n* [[French overseas departments and territories]]\n* [[Administrative divisions of France]]\n* [[Islands controlled by France in the Indian and Pacific oceans]]\n* [[French colonial empire]]\n* [[List of French possessions and colonies]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n* {{wikiatlas|the French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130316074522/http://www.france.fr/en/regions-and-cities/french-southern-and-antarctic-lands French Southern and Antarctic Lands] \u2013 Official French website (in English)\n* {{CIA_World_Factbook_link|fs|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Polar_Regions/Antarctic/French_Southern_Territories|French Southern Territories}}\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Antarctic.shtml Southern & Antarctic Territories]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Crozet.shtml Crozet Archipelago]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Kerguelen.shtml Kerguelen Archipelago]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Terre_Adelie.shtml Terre Ad\u00e9lie]\n\n{{Districts of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list = \n{{Peri-Antarctic countries and overseas territories}}\n{{French overseas departments and territories|state=collapsed}}\n{{EU dependencies|state=collapsed}}\n{{Outlying territories of European countries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Antarctica claims|state=collapsed}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n}}\n\n{{coord|49.250|S|69.167|E|display=title|source:cswiki}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:French Southern And Antarctic Lands}}\n[[Category:French Southern and Antarctic Lands| ]]\n[[Category:Overseas France]]\n[[Category:Countries of the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Dependent territories in Africa]]\n[[Category:East African countries]]\n[[Category:Southeast African countries]]\n[[Category:France and the Antarctic]]\n[[Category:Territorial claims in Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Geography of Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Geography of Overseas France]]\n[[Category:Special territories of the European Union]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1955]]\n[[Category:1955 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:1955 in Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Ramsar sites in France]]", "sha1": "ajl1gr7av3jorv6jcwybi9o8tiqt4am"}}, {"title": "History of French Guiana", "ns": "0", "id": "10761", "revision": {"id": "865567344", "parentid": "865567335", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T18:28:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/64.8.144.211|64.8.144.211]] to version by John Hill.

Before the first Europeans arrived, there was no [[recorded history|written history]] in the territory. It was originally inhabited by a number of Native American peoples, among them the [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs), [[Arawaks|Arawak]], [[Emerillon]], [[Galibi]], [[Palikur]], [[Wayampi]] (also known as Oyampi), and [[Wayana]]. The first Europeans arrived in the expeditions of [[Christopher Columbus]], shortly before 1500.\n\n==Beginnings of European involvement==\nIn 1498 French Guiana was first visited by Europeans when [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed to the region on his third voyage and named it the \"Land of Pariahs\".{{cn|date=April 2018}} In 1608 the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] sent an [[Thornton expedition|expedition to the area in order to create an Italian colony]] for the commerce of Amazonian products to [[Renaissance]] Italy, but the sudden death of [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] stopped it.\n\nIn 1624 the French attempted to settle in the area, but was forced to abandon it in the face of hostility from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who viewed it as a violation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. However French settlers returned in 1630 and in 1643 managed to establish a settlement at [[Cayenne]] along with some small-scale plantations. This second attempt would again be abandoned following [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] attacks. In 1658 the [[Dutch West Indies Company]] seized French territory to establish the [[Cayenne (Dutch colony)|Dutch colony of Cayenne]]. The French returned once more in 1664, and founded a second settlement at [[Sinnamary]] (this was attacked by the Dutch in 1665).\n\nIn 1667 the [[Kingdom of England|English]] seized the area. Following the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] on 31 July 1667 the area was given back to France. The Dutch briefly occupied it for a period in 1676.\n\n==Consolidation of French rule==\nAfter the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, which deprived France of almost all her possessions in the Americas other than Guiana and a few islands, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] sent thousands of settlers to Guiana who were lured there with stories of plentiful gold and easy fortunes to be made. Instead they found a land filled with hostile natives and tropical diseases. One and a half years later only a few hundred survived. These fled to three small islands which could be seen off shore and named them the [[Iles de Salut]] (or \"Islands of Salvation\"). The largest was called [[Royal Island]], another [[Ile Saint-Joseph|St. Joseph]] (after the patron saint of the expedition), and the smallest of the islands, surrounded by strong currents, \u00cele du Diable (the infamous \"[[Devil's Island]]\"). When the survivors of this ill-fated expedition returned home, the terrible stories they told of the colony left a lasting impression in France.\n\nIn 1794, after the death of [[Robespierre]], 193 of his followers were sent to French Guiana. In 1797 the republican general [[Pichegru]] and many deputies and journalists were also sent to the colony. When they arrived they found that only 54 of the 193 deport\u00e9es sent out three years earlier were left; 11 had escaped, and the rest had died of tropical fevers and other diseases. Pichegru managed to escape to the United States and then returned to France where he was eventually executed for plotting against Napoleon.\n\nLater on, slaves were brought out from Africa and plantations were established along the more disease-free rivers. Exports of sugar, hardwood, [[Cayenne pepper]] and other spices brought a certain prosperity to the colony for the first time. Cayenne, the capital, was surrounded by plantations, some of which had several thousand slaves.\n\n== 1800s and the Penal Era ==\nIn 1809 an Anglo-Portuguese naval squadron [[Invasion of Cayenne (1809)|took French Guiana]] (ousting governor [[Victor Hugues]]) and gave it to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in Brazil. However, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1814 the region was handed back to the French, though a Portuguese presence remained until 1817.\n\nIn 1848 France abolished [[slavery]] and the ex-slaves fled{{dubious|date=April 2015}} into the rainforest, setting up communities similar to the ones they had come from in Africa. Subsequently called [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], they formed a sort of [[buffer zone]] between the Europeans (who settled along the coast and main rivers) and the unconquered (and often hostile) Native American tribes of the inland regions. Deprived of slave labour the plantations were soon taken over by the jungle, and the planters ruined.\n\nIn 1850 several shiploads of Indians, Malays and Chinese were brought out{{by whom|date=December 2012}} to work the plantations but, instead, they set up shops in Cayenne and other settlements.\n\n[[Image:Quartier - Disciplinaire, St. Laurent.jpg|thumb|300px|\"Quartier \u2013 Disciplinaire\", [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]], 1954]]\n\nIn 1852 the first shiploads of chained convicts arrived from France. In 1885, to get rid of habitual criminals and to increase the number of colonists, the French Parliament passed a law that anyone, male or female, who had more than three sentences for theft of more than three months each, would be sent to French Guiana as a ''rel\u00e9gu\u00e9''. These ''rel\u00e9gu\u00e9s'' were to be kept in prison there for six months but then freed to become settlers in the colony. However, this experiment failed dismally. The ex-prisoners, unable to make a living off the land found themselves forced to revert to crime or to eke out a hand-to-mouth existence until they died. In fact, transportation to French Guiana as a ''rel\u00e9gu\u00e9'' amounted to a life sentence, and usually a short life sentence, as most of the ''rel\u00e9gu\u00e9s'' died very quickly from disease and malnutrition.\n\nThe prisoners would arrive at [[St-Laurent du Maroni|St Laurent du Maroni]] before being transported to various camps throughout the country. The [[Iles du Salut]] were used to house political prisoners and for solitary confinement. The islands became notorious for the brutality of life there, centering on the notorious [[Devil's Island]]. Famous figures sent to the islands included [[Alfred Dreyfus]] (in 1895) and [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] (in the 1930s). Charri\u00e8re managed to escape and later wrote a best-selling book about his experiences called ''[[Papillon (autobiography)|Papillon]]''.\n\n[[File:Condemned men's block, St. Laurent.jpg|thumb|300px|\"Quartier Sp\u00e9cial\" \u2013 Condemned men's block, St. Laurent, 1954 (the guillotine stood at the spot where the photographer took the photo).]]\n\nIn 1853, gold was discovered in the interior, precipitating border disputes with Brazil and [[Suriname (Dutch colony)|Suriname]] (these were later settled in 1891, 1899 and 1915, although a small region of the border with [[Suriname]] remains in dispute). The [[Republic of Independent Guyana]], in French ''La R\u00e9publique de la Guyane ind\u00e9pendante'' and commonly referred to by the name of the capital \"Counani\", was created in the area which was disputed by France (as part of [[French Guiana]]) and [[Brazil]] in the late nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=131132x1901x04&p=123&do=page |title=BIU Sant\u00e9 - Recherche dans les p\u00e9riodiques Medic@ - Map of area disputed between France and Brazil|publisher=Web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref>\n\n== 20th century ==\nThe territory of [[Inini]], consisting of most of the interior of French Guiana, was created in 1930. It was abolished in 1946.\n\nDuring World War II the local government declared its allegiance to the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government, despite widespread support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]. This government was removed on 22 March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2626080 |title=22 Mar 1943 - FRENCH GUINEA TURNS FROM GIRAUD TO DE GAULLE NEW |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1943-03-22 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref>\n\nFrench Guiana became an [[D\u00e9partement d'outre-mer|overseas ''d\u00e9partement'']] of France on 19 March 1946.\n\nThe infamous penal colonies, including Devil's Island, were gradually phased out and then formally closed in 1951. At first, only those freed prisoners who could raise the fare for their return passage to France were able to go home, so French Guiana was haunted after the official closing of the prisons by numerous freed convicts leading an aimless existence in the colony.\n\nVisitors to the site in December 1954 reported being deeply shocked by the conditions and the constant screams from the cell-block still in use for convicts who had gone insane and which had only tiny ventilation slots at the tops of the walls under the roof. Food was pushed in and bodies removed once a day.\n\nIn 1964 [[Kourou]] was chosen to be launch site for rockets, largely due to its favourable location near the [[equator]]. The [[Guiana Space Centre]] was built and became operational in 1968. This has provided some local employment and the mainly foreign technicians, and hundreds of troops stationed in the region to prevent sabotage, bring a little income to the local economy.\n\nThe 1970s saw the settlement of [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugees from [[Laos]] in the county, primarily to the towns of [[Javouhey]] and [[Cacao, French Guiana|Cacao]]. The Green Plan (''Le Plan Vert'') of 1976 aimed to improve production, though it had only limited success. A movement for increased autonomy from France gained momentum in the 70s and 80s, along with the increasing success of the Parti Socialiste Guyanais.\n\nProtests by those calling for more autonomy from France have become increasingly vocal. Protests in 1996, 1997 and 2000 all ended in violence.

groups==\nEstimates of the percentages of French Guiana ethnic composition vary, a situation compounded by the large proportion of immigrants.\n\nCreoles, or Mulattoes (people of mixed African and French ancestry), are the largest ethnic group, though estimates vary as to the exact percentage, depending upon whether the large [[Haiti]]an community is included as well. Generally the Creole population is judged to be about 60 to 70% of the total population if Haitians (comprising roughly one-third of Creoles) are included, and 30 to 50% without.\n\nRoughly 14% of the population is of European ancestry. The vast majority of these are of French heritage, though there are also people of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[British people|British]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry.\n\nThe main Asian communities are the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] (about 3-4%, primarily from [[Zhejiang|Zhejiang province]] in [[mainland China]] and Hong Kong) and [[Hmong people|Hmong]] from [[Laos]] (1-2%). There are also smaller groups from various [[Caribbean]] islands, mainly [[Saint Lucia]] as well as [[Dominica]]. Other Asian groups include [[East Indians]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]].\n\nThe main groups living in the interior are the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]] (formerly called \"Bush Negroes\") who are from African descent, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]. The Maroons, descendants of escaped African slaves, live primarily along the [[Maroni River]]. The main Maroon groups are the Saramaca, Aucan (both of whom also live in [[Suriname]]), and Boni (Aluku).\n\nThe main Amerindian groups (forming about 3%\u20134% of the population) are the [[Arawaks|Arawak]], [[Kalina people|Carib]], [[Emerillon]] (now called [[Teko]]), [[Galibi]] (now called the [[Kali\u00f1a]]), [[Palikur people|Palikur]], [[Wayampi]] and [[Wayana]]. As of the late 1990s, there was evidence of an [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted group]] of Wayampi.\n\n==Languages==\n[[French language|French]] and [[Guianese Creole French]] are the most widely spoken languages. There are also several native languages, including [[Arawak language|Arawak]] (Arawak and Palikur), [[Carib language|Carib]] (Kalina and Wayana), and [[Tupi-Guarani]] (Teko and Wayampi).<ref name=ETHNOLOGUE>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=GF|title=French Guiana|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref> Other languages spoken include [[Hakka Chinese]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]].<ref name=ETHNOLOGUE/>\nThe official language, like for all [[overseas departments and territories of France]], is French.\n\n==Religion==\nThe dominant religion of French Guiana is Roman Catholicism; the Maroons and Amerindian people maintain their own religions. The Hmong people are also mainly Catholic owing to the influence of missionaries who helped bring them to French Guiana.<ref>{{cite book|title=South America |author=Danny Palmerlee|year= 2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn=1-74104-443-X|url= https://books.google.com/?id=zeUwp50DR9EC&pg=PA746&lpg=PA746&dq=%22French+Guiana%22+date:2000-2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Demographics of French overseas departments and territories}}\n{{Ethnic groups in French Guiana}}\n{{South America in topic|Demographics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demographics Of French Guiana}}\n[[Category:Geography of French Guiana]]\n[[Category:Demographics of South America|French Guiana]]", "sha1": "njnzdohd0hut9ndsj46ih6hwx5rr2n8"}}, {"title": "Politics of French Guiana", "ns": "0", "id": "10764", "revision": {"id": "820764294", "parentid": "814585471", "timestamp": "2018-01-16T13:40:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Frietjes", "id": "13791031"}, "comment": "replace per [[Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2017_December_16#Template:Historical_information_needed|tfd outcome]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{Missing information|the history of the subject|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Politics of French Guiana}}\n\n[[French Guiana]] is not a separate territory but is both an overseas [[region of France|r\u00e9gion]] and overseas [[Departments of France|department]] of [[France]], with the same government institutions as areas on the French mainland. The administrative center is [[Cayenne]].\n\nThe President of France appoints a [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] (resident at the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture building]] in Cayenne) as his representative to head the local government of French Guiana. There are two local executive bodies: the 19\u2011member general council and the 34\u2011member regional council, both elected. They will soon be reunited into a single council, since they have authority on exactly the same territory.\n\nIn 2014 the [[prefect]] is [[\u00c9ric Spitz]]. The President of the general council is [[Alain Tien-Liong]] and the President of the Regional Council is [[Rodolphe Alexandre]].\n\n==Key issues and  players==\nPolitics in French Guiana are dominated by the [[Guianese Socialist Party]], which has a close association with the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] in mainland France.\n\nA chronic issue affecting French Guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine [[gold prospecting|gold prospectors]] from [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]]. The border between the department and [[Suriname]] is formed by the [[Maroni River]], which flows through rain forest and is difficult for the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (France)|Gendarmerie]] and the [[French Foreign Legion]] to patrol.\n\nThere have been several phases launched by the French government to combat illegal gold mining in French Guiana, beginning with Operation Anaconda beginning in 2003, followed by Operation Harpie in 2008, 2009 and Operation Harpie Reinforce in 2010. Colonel Fran\u00e7ois M\u00fcller, the commander of French Guiana's gendarme, believes these operations have been successful. However, after each operation ends, Brazilian miners, [[garimpeiros]], return.<ref>[http://untoldstories.pulitzercenter.org/2010/04/french-guiana-interview-with-colonel-francois-muller-commander-of-the-gendarmes.html#more untoldstories.pulitzercenter.org]</ref> Soon after Operation Harpie Reinforce began, an altercation took place between French authorities and Brazilian miners. On March 12, 2010, a team of French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation, during which \"the soldiers had arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold... currently worth about $22,317\". Garimpeiros returned to retrieve the lost loot and colleagues. \"The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber \"flash balls\" but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500&nbsp;grammes of gold. \"The violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of 617 grammes of gold, about 20 percent of the quantity seized in 2009 during the battle against illegal mining\", said Phillipe Duporge, the director of French Guiana's border police, at a press conference the next day.\"<ref>[http://untoldstories.pulitzercenter.org/2010/03/french-guiana-welcome-to-the-jungle.html#more untoldstories.pulitzercenter.org]</ref>\n\n==General Council of French Guiana==\n{{main article|General Council of French Guiana}}\nThe [[General Council of French Guiana]] is the deliberative [[Executive (government)|executive]] assembly and is composed of 19 members who are elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms.

The new public service became known as TIG (Long Distance Transport of Guyana).The TIG coexist with Taxi Co. The vehicle types are the same (a sticker \"TIG\" stands for the first second) but the Convention requires that transportation TIG have fixed schedules (vehicles go, they are filled or not) on defined paths (no collection or deposit on demand, no shortcuts). Prices are generally lower than the prices charged by the Taxi Co (example: Cayenne in Saint-Georges-de-Oyapock at \u20ac31 instead of 40 \u20ac).\n\n==The taxi boats==\n[[Canoe]]-taxis are on the [[Maroni]] (Surinamese border) between [[Saint-Laurent du Maroni]] and [[Apatou]], as well as the [[River Oyapock|Oyapock]] (Brazilian border) between [[Saint-Georges-de-Oyapock]] and the Brazilian city of [[Oiapoque]].Apatou is located at 3 o'clock on the [[Maroni (river)|Maroni]]. Departures are daily at 11:00 (Degrad of the Ice in Saint-Laurent du Maroni) and back to 7 am. The price is 11 \u20ac one way. To cross the Maroni (to [[Albina, Suriname|Albina]]), count 5 \u20ac each way.Oiapoque is located 15 minutes from St. George. Departures are on demand, usually when a number of passengers is met. Unlike Maroni, there is no curfew on the Oyapock. Canoes are available however, fewer night and the prices are somewhat higher (in 2012, crossing for a person: 5 \u20ac / day 10 reais, 7 \u20ac / night 15 reais).\n\n==Railways==\n[[File:Ariane 5 launch pad.jpg|thumb|right|The railway in the Guiana Space Centre]]\nA short railway is used within the [[Guiana Space Centre]] (this short railway is for transporting spacecraft inside the base to the launch pad, not for passenger use).

He is widely regarded as one of the founders of the [[French New Wave]].<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 24 October 1984.</ref> In a film career lasting over a quarter of a century, he remains an icon of the [[Cinema of France|French film]] industry, having worked on over 25 films. <!--Along with [[Jean-Luc Godard]], Truffaut was one of the most influential figures of the French New Wave, inspiring directors such as [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Brian De Palma]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Wes Anderson]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.--> Truffaut's film ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' came to be a defining film of the French New Wave movement, and was followed by four sequels, ''[[Antoine et Colette]]'', ''[[Stolen Kisses]]'', ''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed and Board]]'', and ''[[Love on the Run (1979 film)|Love on the Run]]'', between 1958 and 1979.\n\nTruffaut's 1973 film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' earned him critical acclaim and several accolades, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. His other notable films include ''[[Shoot the Piano Player]]'' (1960), ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' (1961), ''[[The Wild Child]]'' (1970), ''[[Two English Girls]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Woman Next Door]]'' (1981). He passed away at the age of 52.\n\n== Early life ==\nTruffaut was born in Paris on 6 February 1932. His mother was Janine de Montferrand. His mother's future husband, Roland Truffaut, accepted him as an adopted son and gave him his surname. He was passed around to live with various [[Nanny|nannies]] and his grandmother for a number of years. It was his grandmother who instilled in him her love of books and music. He lived with his grandmother until her death, when Truffaut was eight years old. It was only after his grandmother's death that he lived with his parents for the first time.<ref name=\"New Wave Film Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/francois-truffaut.shtml |title=FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT \u2013 French New Wave Director |publisher=Newwavefilm.com |accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> The identity of Truffaut's biological father was unknown, though a private detective agency in 1968 revealed that their inquiry into the matter led to a Roland Levy, a Jewish dentist from [[Bayonne]]. Truffaut's mother's family disputed the findings but Truffaut himself believed and embraced them.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtDWnNzi3jMC&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=%22Francois%20Truffaut%22%20%22a%20dentist%20from%22 |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: film author 1932\u20131984 \u2013 Robert Ingram, Paul Duncan |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nTruffaut would often stay with friends and try to be out of the house as much as possible. His best friend throughout his youth and until his death was [[Robert Lachenay]], who was the inspiration for the character Ren\u00e9 Bigey in ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' and would work as an assistant on some of Truffaut's films. It was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. He was eight years old when he saw his first movie, [[Abel Gance]]'s ''Paradis Perdu'' (''Paradise Lost'') from 1939. It was there that his obsession began. He frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. After being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. Two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.<ref name=\"New Wave Film Encyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"AllMovie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/franois-truffaut-114620/bio |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut \u2013 Movie and Film Biography and Filmography |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=21 October 1984 |accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nTruffaut frequented [[Henri Langlois]]' [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] where he was exposed to countless foreign films from around the world. It was here that he became familiar with American cinema and directors such as [[John Ford]], [[Howard Hawks]] and [[Nicholas Ray]], as well as those of British director [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/francois-truffaut-at-cinematheque-francaise-747692|title=\u2018Francois Truffaut\u2019 at the Cinematheque Francaise: Exhibition Review|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter starting his own film club in 1948, Truffaut met [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]], who would have great effect on his professional and personal life. Bazin was a critic and the head of another film society at the time. He became a personal friend of Truffaut's and helped him out of various financial and criminal situations during his formative years.<ref>{{cite book| last=Truffaut| first=Fran\u00e7ois| title=Correspondence, 1945\u20131984| location=New York| publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux| year= 1989| pages = 17, 50, 57}}</ref>\n\nTruffaut joined the [[French Army]] in 1950, aged 18, but spent the next two years trying to escape. Truffaut was arrested for attempting to desert the army. Bazin used his various political contacts to get Truffaut released and set him up with a job at his newly formed film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]''. Over the next few years, Truffaut became a critic (and later editor) at ''Cahiers'', where he became notorious for his brutal, unforgiving reviews. He was called \"The Gravedigger of French Cinema\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2009/04/quatre-cents-truffaut-cinema |title=Film as an act of love|author = SUKHDEV SANDHU |publisher= New Statesman |date=2 April 2009}}</ref> and was the only French critic not invited to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1958. He supported Bazin in the development of one of the most influential theories of cinema itself, the [[auteur theory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|title=Auteur theory FILMMAKING |author = The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher= Encyclopedia Britannica |date=20 July 1998}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Truffaut wrote an article in ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'' called \"Une Certaine Tendance du Cin\u00e9ma Fran\u00e7ais\" (\"A Certain Trend of French Cinema\"),<ref name=\"AllMovie\" /> in which he attacked the current state of French films, lambasting certain screenwriters and producers, and listing eight directors he considered incapable of devising the kinds of \"vile\" and \"grotesque\" characters and storylines that he declared were characteristic of the mainstream French film industry: [[Jean Renoir]], [[Robert Bresson]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jacques Becker]], [[Abel Gance]], [[Max Ophuls]], [[Jacques Tati]] and [[Roger Leenhardt]]. The article caused a storm of controversy, and also landed Truffaut an offer to write for the nationally circulated, more widely read cultural weekly ''Arts-Lettres-Spectacles''.  Truffaut would pen more than 500 film articles for that publication over the next four years.\n\nTruffaut later devised the [[auteur theory]], which stated that the director was the \"author\" of his work; that great directors such as Renoir or Hitchcock have distinct styles and themes that permeate all of their films. Although his theory was not widely accepted then, it gained some support in the 1960s from American critic [[Andrew Sarris]]. In 1967, Truffaut published his book-length interview of Hitchcock, ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut]]'' (New York: [[Simon and Schuster]]).\n\nAfter having been a critic, Truffaut decided to make films of his own. He started out with the short film ''[[Une Visite]]'' in 1955 and followed that up with ''[[Les Mistons]]'' in 1957. After seeing [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' at the [[Expo 58]], he was inspired to make his [[List of directorial debuts|feature film directorial debut]] with ''[[The 400 Blows]]'', which was released in 1959 to much critical and commercial acclaim. Truffaut received a Best Director award from the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the same festival that had banned him only one year earlier. The film follows the character of [[Antoine Doinel]] through his perilous misadventures in school, an unhappy home life and later reform school. The film is highly autobiographical. Both Truffaut and Doinel were only children of loveless marriages; they both committed petty crimes of theft and truancy from the military. Truffaut cast [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Antoine Doinel. L\u00e9aud was seen as an ordinary boy of 14 who auditioned for the role after seeing a flyer, but interviews filmed after the film's release (one is included on the Criterion DVD of the film) reveal L\u00e9aud's natural sophistication and an instinctive understanding of acting for the camera. L\u00e9aud and Truffaut collaborated on several films over the years. Their most noteworthy collaboration was the continuation of the Antoine Doinel character in a series of films called \"The Antoine Doinel Cycle\".\n\nThe primary focus of ''The 400 Blows'' is on the life of a young character by the name of Antoine Doinel. This film follows this character through his troubled adolescence. He is caught in between an unstable parental relationship and an isolated youth. The film focuses on the real life events of the director, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. From birth Truffaut was thrown into an undesired situation. As he was born out of wedlock, his birth had to remain a secret because of the social stigma associated with illegitimacy. He was registered as \"A child born to an unknown father\" in the hospital records. He was looked after by a nurse for an extended period of time. His mother eventually married and her husband Roland gave his surname, Truffaut, to Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nAlthough he was legally accepted as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. The Truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. This experience saddened them greatly and as a result they despised Fran\u00e7ois because of the memory of regret that he represented (Knopf 4{{Specify|date=September 2008}}). He was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. Fran\u00e7ois was sent to live with his grandparents. It wasn't until Fran\u00e7ois's grandmother's death before his parents took him in, much to the dismay of his own mother. The experiences with his mother were harsh. He recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. The relationship with Roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. Fran\u00e7ois had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. They would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. He even recalled memories of being alone during Christmas. Being left alone forced Fran\u00e7ois into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. Sadly, these kind gestures often resulted in a catastrophic event causing him to get scolded by his mother. His father would mostly laugh them off.\n\n''The 400 Blows'' marked the beginning of the [[French New Wave]] movement, which gave directors such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Jacques Rivette]] a wider audience. The New Wave dealt with a self-conscious rejection of traditional cinema structure. This was a topic on which Truffaut had been writing for years.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The 400 Blows'', Truffaut featured disjunctive editing and seemingly random voice-overs in his next film ''[[Shoot the Piano Player]]'' (1960) starring [[Charles Aznavour]]. Truffaut has stated that in the middle of filming, he realized that he hated gangsters. But since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie more attuned to his liking. Even though ''Shoot the Piano Player'' was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office. While the film focused on two of the French New Wave's favorite elements, American [[film noir]] and themselves, Truffaut never again experimented as heavily.\n\nIn 1962, Truffaut directed his third movie, ''[[Jules and Jim]]'', a romantic drama starring [[Jeanne Moreau]]. Over the next decade, Truffaut had varying degrees of success with his films. In 1963, Truffaut was approached to direct an American film called ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', with a treatment written by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' journalists, [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David Newman]] and [[Robert Benton]] intended to introduce the French New Wave to Hollywood. Although he was interested enough to help in script development, Truffaut ultimately declined, but not before interesting [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and American actor and would be producer, [[Warren Beatty]], the latter of whom proceeded with the film with director [[Arthur Penn]]. As for Truffaut, his first non-French film was a 1966 adaptation of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s classic science fiction novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'', showcasing Truffaut's love of books. His only English-speaking film was a great challenge for Truffaut, because he barely spoke English himself. This was also his first film shot in color. The larger scale production was difficult for Truffaut, who had worked only with small crews and budgets.\n\n[[File:Avant-premi\u00e8re L'Amour en fuite Luxembourg Cin\u00e9ma Marivaux 18 avril 1979 Photo Carlo Hansen Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|left|Truffaut and [[Claude Jade]] in 1979|253.993x253.993px]]\nTruffaut worked on projects with varied subjects. ''[[The Bride Wore Black]]'' (1968), a brutal tale of revenge, is a stylish homage to the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (once again starring Jeanne Moreau). ''[[Mississippi Mermaid]]'' (1969), with [[Catherine Deneuve]], is an identity-bending romantic thriller. ''[[Stolen Kisses]]'' (1968) and ''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed and Board]]'' (1970) are continuations of the Antoine Doinel Cycle, both starring [[Claude Jade]] as Antoine's fianc\u00e9e and later wife Christine Darbon. ''[[The Wild Child]]'' (1970) included Truffaut's acting debut in the lead role of 18th century physician [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]].\n\n''[[Two English Girls]]'' (1971) is the female reflection of the same love story as \"Jules et Jim\". It is based on a story written by [[Henri-Pierre Roche]], who also wrote ''Jules and Jim''. It is about a man who falls equally in love with two sisters, and their love affair over a period of years.\n\n''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' won Truffaut a [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film Oscar]] in 1973.<ref name=\"Oscars1975\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1975 |title=The 47th Academy Awards (1975) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=10 January 2012 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> The film is probably his most reflective work. It is the story of a film crew trying to finish their film while dealing with all of the personal and professional problems that accompany making a movie. Truffaut plays the director of the fictional film being made. This film features scenes shown in his previous films. It is considered to be his best film since his earliest work. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine placed it on their list of 100 Best Films of the Century (along with ''The 400 Blows'').\n\nIn 1975, Truffaut gained more notoriety with ''[[The Story of Ad\u00e8le H.]]'' [[Isabelle Adjani]] in the title role earned a nomination for a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Oscar]]. Truffaut's 1976 film ''[[Small Change (film)|Small Change]]'' gained a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Nomination for Best Foreign Film]]. ''[[Love on the Run (1979 film)|Love on the Run]]'' starring Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud and Claude Jade is the final movie of the Doinel Cycle.\n\nOne of Truffaut's final films gave him an international revival. In 1980, his film ''[[The Last Metro]]'' garnered twelve [[C\u00e9sar Award]] nominations with ten wins, including Best Director.\n\nTruffaut's final movie was shot in black and white. It gives his career almost a sense of having bookends. ''[[Confidentially Yours]]'' is Truffaut's tribute to his favorite director, [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. It deals with numerous Hitchcockian themes, such as private guilt vs. public innocence, a woman investigating a murder, anonymous locations, etc.\n\nAmong Truffaut's films, a series features the character [[Antoine Doinel]], played by the actor [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]]. He began his career in ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' at the age of fourteen, and continued as the favorite actor and \"double\" of Truffaut. The series continued with ''[[Antoine and Colette]]'' (a short film in the anthology ''Love at Twenty''), ''[[Stolen Kisses]]'' (in which he falls in love with Christine Darbon alias [[Claude Jade]]), ''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed and Board]]'' about the married couple Antoine and Christine\u2014and, finally, ''[[Love on the Run (1979 film)|Love on the Run]]'', where the couple go through a divorce.\n\nIn the last movies, L\u00e9aud's girlfriend and later wife, Christine Darbon, was played by Truffaut's favorite actress, [[Claude Jade]]. During the filming of ''Stolen Kisses'', Truffaut himself fell in love with, and was briefly engaged to, Claude Jade.\n\nA keen reader, Truffaut adapted many literary works, including two novels by [[Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9]], [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'', [[Henry James]]' \"[[The Altar of the Dead]]\", filmed as ''[[The Green Room (film)|The Green Room]]'', and several American [[Detective fiction|detective novels]].\n\nTruffaut's other films were from original screenplays, often co-written by the screenwriters [[Suzanne Schiffman]] or [[Jean Gruault]]. They featured diverse subjects, the sombre ''[[The Story of Ad\u00e8le H.]]'', inspired by the life of the daughter of [[Victor Hugo]], with [[Isabelle Adjani]]; ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'', shot at the [[Victorine Studios]] describing the ups and downs of film-making; and ''[[The Last Metro]]'', set during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]], a film rewarded by ten [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s.\n\nKnown as being a lifelong cinephile, Truffaut once (according to the 1993 documentary film ''[[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: Stolen Portraits]]'') threw a hitchhiker he had picked up out of his car after learning that the hitchhiker didn't like films.\n\nTruffaut is admired among other filmmakers and several tributes to his work have appeared in other films such as ''[[Almost Famous]]'', ''[[Face (2009 film)|Face]]'' and ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', as well as novelist [[Haruki Murakami]]'s ''[[Kafka on the Shore]]''.\n\nHe also acted, appearing in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1977 film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', where he played scientist Claude Lacombe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telerama.fr/cinema/qu-allait-donc-faire-truffaut-chez-spielberg,118402.php|title=Qu\u2019allait-donc faire Truffaut chez Spielberg ?|author=Aur\u00e9lien Ferenczi|date=26 October 2014|publisher=T\u00e9l\u00e9rama}}</ref>\n\n== Attitude towards other filmmakers ==\nTruffaut expressed his admiration for filmmakers such as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Truffaut wrote ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut]]'', a book about Hitchcock, based on a lengthy series of interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/393601.Hitchcock_Truffaut|title=Hitchcock|author=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut|date=|work=Goodreads|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Jean Renoir]], he said: \"I think Renoir is the only filmmaker who's practically infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And I think if he never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity\u2014human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if you know his work\u2014which is very comprehensive, since he dealt with all sorts of subjects\u2014when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution\".<ref>On Jean Renoir [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2010/08/francois-truffaut-last-interview.html TRUFFAUT\u2019S LAST INTERVIEW]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, [[Jean-Luc Godard]] accused Truffaut of making a movie that was a \"lie\", and Truffaut replied with a 20-page letter in which he accused Godard of being a radical-chic hypocrite, a man who believed everyone to be \"equal\" in theory only. The two never saw each other again.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Godard and Truffaut: Their spiky, complex friendship is its own great story in 'Two in the Wave|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2010/05/27/godard-truffaut-and-their-spiky-friendship/}}</ref> However, as noted by Serge Toubiana and Antoine de Baecque in their biography of Truffaut, Godard tried to reconcile their friendship later on, and after Truffaut's death wrote the introduction to a collection of his letters and a lengthy tribute in his video-essay film ''[[Histoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Baecque |first1=Antione |last2=Toubiana |first2=Serge |title=Truffaut: A Biography |date=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520225244 }}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nTruffaut was married to Madeleine Morgenstern from 1957 to 1965, and they had two daughters, Laura (born 1959) and Eva (born 1961). Madeleine was the daughter of [[Ignace Morgenstern]], managing director of one of France's largest film distribution companies, and was largely responsible for securing funding for Truffaut's first films. He had affairs with many of his leading ladies: in 1968 he was engaged to actress [[Claude Jade]]; Truffaut and actress [[Fanny Ardant]] lived together from 1981 to 1984 and had a daughter, Jos\u00e9phine Truffaut (born 28 September 1983).<ref name=\"New Wave Film Encyclopedia\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/truffaut-obit.html|title=Francois Truffaut, New Wave Director, Dies|author=Eric Pace|date=22 October 1984|work=New York Times|accessdate=1 May 2013|quote=Mr. Truffaut's 1957 marriage to Madeleine Morgenstern ended in divorce.

Over time, this doctrine evolved into the modern concepts of fair use and [[fair dealing]]. Fair use was a [[common law|common-law]] doctrine in the U.S. until it was incorporated into the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]], {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}.\n\nThe term \"fair use\" originated in the United States.<ref name=\"Folsom\">{{cite court |litigants=Folsom v.

A similar-sounding principle, [[fair dealing]], exists in some other [[common law]] jurisdictions but in fact it is more similar in principle to the enumerated exceptions found under civil law systems. [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright.\n\nIn response to perceived over-expansion of copyrights, several electronic civil liberties and free expression organizations began in the 1990s to add fair use cases to their dockets and concerns. These include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (\"EFF\"), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], the [[American Library Association]], numerous clinical programs at law schools, and others. The \"[[Lumen (website)|Chilling Effects]]\" archive was established in 2002 as a coalition of several law school clinics and the EFF to document the use of [[cease and desist]] letters. Most recently, in 2006, [[Stanford University]] began an initiative called \"The [[Fair Use Project]]\" (FUP) to help artists, particularly filmmakers, fight lawsuits brought against them by large corporations.\n\n== United States ==\n=== U.S. fair use factors{{anchor|Use rationale|17 USC \u00a7107}}<!-- a considerable number of Wikipedia's copyright templates link to this section.--> ===\nExamples of fair use in [[United States copyright law]] include commentary, search engines, criticism, [[parody]], news reporting, research, and scholarship.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Netanei|first1=Neil Weinstock|title=Making Sense of Fair Use|journal=Lewis & Clark Law Review|date=2011|volume=15|issue=3|page=715|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt5mh7w8hc/qt5mh7w8hc.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> Fair use provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor [[Legal tests|test]].\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has traditionally characterized fair use as an [[affirmative defense]], but in ''[[Lenz v.

They were intended by Congress to restate, but not replace, the prior judge-made law. As Judge [[Pierre N. Leval]] has written, the statute does not \"define or explain [fair use's] contours or objectives.\" While it \"leav[es] open the possibility that other factors may bear on the question, the statute identifies none.\"<ref name=Leval /> That is, courts are entitled to consider other factors in addition to the four statutory factors.\n\n==== 1. Purpose and character of the use ====\nThe first factor is \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" To justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new.\n\nIn the 1841 copyright case [[Folsom v. Marsh]], [[Joseph Story|Justice Joseph Story]] wrote:\n{{quote|\"[A] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticise, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a [[piracy]].\"<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Harper & Row v.

In the 1994 decision ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]'',<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that when the purpose of the use is transformative, this makes the first factor more likely to favor fair use.<ref name=Unbundling>{{cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=Pamela|title=Unbundling Fair Uses|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=2009|volume=77|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_77/Samuelson2_Vol_77_Apr.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> Before the ''Campbell'' decision, federal Judge Pierre Leval argued that transformativeness is central to the fair use analysis in his 1990 article, [[Toward a Fair Use Standard]].<ref name=\"Leval\">{{cite journal|last=Leval|first=Pierre N.|year=1990|title=Toward a Fair Use Standard|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|volume=103|issue=5|pages=1105\u20131136|doi=10.2307/1341457|jstor=1341457}}</ref> ''[[Blanch v. Koons]]'' is another example of a fair use case that focused on transformativeness. In 2006, [[Jeff Koons]] used a photograph taken by commercial photographer [[Andrea Blanch]] in a collage painting.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Blanch v. Koons|vol=467 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=244 |court=2d Cir.|date=2006-10-26|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1374144.html|accessdate=2015-11-15}}</ref> Koons appropriated a central portion of an advertisement she had been commissioned to shoot for a magazine. Koons prevailed in part because his use was found transformative under the first fair use factor.\n\nThe ''Campbell'' case also addressed the subfactor mentioned in the quotation above, \"whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" In an earlier case, ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court had stated that \"every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair.\" In ''Campbell'', the court clarified that this is not a \"hard evidentiary presumption\" and that even the tendency that commercial purpose will \"weigh against a finding of fair use . . . will vary with the context.\" The ''Campbell'' court held that hip-hop group [[2 Live Crew]]'s parody of the song \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was fair use, even though the parody was sold for profit. Thus, having a commercial purpose does not preclude a use from being found fair, even though it makes it less likely.<ref name=Reclaiming />\n\nLikewise, the noncommercial purpose of a use makes it more likely to be found a fair use, but it does not make it a fair use automatically.<ref name=Reclaiming>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|chapter=Appendix D: Myths and Realities About Fair Use}}</ref> For instance, in ''[[L.A. Times v. Free Republic]]'', the court found that the noncommercial use of ''Los Angeles Times'' content by the Free Republic Web site was not fair use, since it allowed the public to obtain material at no cost that they would otherwise pay for. [[Richard Story]] similarly ruled in ''Code Revision Commission and State of Georgia v. [[Public.Resource.Org]], Inc.'' that despite the fact that it is a non-profit and didn't sell the work, the service profited from its unauthorized publication of the [[Official Code of Georgia Annotated]] because of \"the attention, recognition, and contributions\" it received in association with the work.<ref name=\"ars-georgiacopy\">{{cite web|title=If you publish Georgia's state laws, you'll get sued for copyright and lose|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/public-records-activist-violated-copyright-by-publishing-georgia-legal-code-online/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor is whether the use fulfills any of the preamble purposes, also mentioned in the legislation above, as these have been interpreted as \"illustrative\" of transformative use.<ref>{{cite court | litigants=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. | vol=510 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=569 | pinpoint=584 | date=1994 | url=https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/a5fa374f-da05-4ac4-8da7-152a0b0828b4/?context=1000516}}</ref>\n\nIt is arguable, given the dominance of a rhetoric of the \"transformative\" in recent fair use determinations, that the first factor and transformativeness in general have become the most important parts of fair use.\n\n==== 2. Nature of the copyrighted work ====\n[[File:J. D. Salinger Signature.svg|thumb|alt=Signature of J.D. Salinger in 1950|The unpublished nature of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s letters was a key issue in the court's analysis of the second fair use factor in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''.]]\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional.<ref>''[[Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling v. RDR Books]]'', 575 F. Supp. 2d 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)</ref>\n\nTo prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, [[idea-expression divide|facts and ideas are not protected by copyright]]\u2014only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. On the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. The [[Zapruder film]] of the [[assassination of President Kennedy]], for example, was purchased and copyrighted by ''Time'' magazine. Yet its copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when ''Time'' tried to [[enjoin]] the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject in ''Time Inc v. [[Bernard J. Geis|Bernard Geis]] Associates''.<ref>293 F. Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)</ref>\n\nIn the decisions of the [[Second Circuit]] in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Salinger v. Random House, Inc. |vol=811 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=90 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/811_F2d_90.htm |accessdate=2015-11-18 |quote=}}</ref> and in ''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt & Co'',<ref>''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt & Co'', 695 F. Supp. 1493 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1988)</ref> the aspect of whether the copied work has been previously published was considered crucial, assuming the right of the original author to control the circumstances of the publication of his work or preference not to publish at all. However, Judge Pierre N. Leval views this importation of certain aspects of France's ''droit moral d'artiste'' ([[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of the artist) into American copyright law as \"bizarre and contradictory\" because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect.<ref name=\"Leval\" /> This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than laws about copyright. The statutory fair use provision was amended in response to these concerns by adding a final sentence: \"The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\"\n\n==== 3. Amount and substantiality ====\n[[File:GoogleImageSearch.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Google Image Search results page|The Ninth Circuit has held that the use of thumbnails in image search engines is fair use.]]\nThe third factor assesses the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work that has been used. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, the more likely the use will be considered fair.\n\nUsing most or all of a work does not bar a finding of fair use. It simply makes the third factor less favorable to the defendant. For instance, in ''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'' copying entire television programs for private viewing was upheld as fair use, at least when the copying is done for the purposes of [[time-shifting]]. In ''Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation,'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] held that copying an entire photo to use as a [[thumbnail]] in online search results did not even weigh against fair use, \"if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use\".\n\nHowever, even the use of a small percentage of a work can make the third factor unfavorable to the defendant, because the \"substantiality\" of the portion used is considered in addition to the amount used. For instance, in ''[[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]],'',<ref name=Harper&Row>{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court held that a news article's quotation of fewer than 400 words from [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s 200,000-word memoir was sufficient to make the third fair use factor weigh against the defendants, because the portion taken was the \"heart of the work.\" This use was ultimately found not to be fair.<ref name=Harper&Row />\n\n==== 4. Effect upon work's value ====\nThe fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the copyright owner, who must demonstrate the impact of the infringement on commercial use of the work.\n\nFor example, in ''Sony Corp v. Universal City Studios'',<ref name=Sony>{{ussc|name=Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|link=|volume=464|page=417|pin=451|year=1984}}</ref> the copyright owner, [[Universal Studios|Universal]], failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of [[Betamax]] had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In ''Harper & Row,'' the case regarding President Ford's memoirs, the Supreme Court labeled the fourth factor \"the single most important element of fair use\" and it has enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. Yet the Supreme Court's more recent announcement in ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc''<ref name=\"510 US 569\">{{ussc|name=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.|link=|volume=510|page=569|pin=|year=1994}}</ref> that \"all [four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright\" has helped modulate this emphasis in interpretation.\n\nIn evaluating the fourth factor, courts often consider two kinds of harm to the potential market for the original work.\n* First, courts consider whether the use in question acts as a direct market [[substitute good|substitute]] for the original work. In ''Campbell'', the Supreme Court stated that \"when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of the original, it clearly supersedes the object of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur\". In one instance, a court ruled that this factor weighed against a defendant who had made unauthorized movie trailers for video retailers, since his trailers acted as direct substitutes for the copyright owner's official trailers.<ref name=VideoPipeline>{{cite court |litigants=Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista |vol=342 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=191 |pinpoint= |court=3d Cir. |date=2000-09-19 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11920632898766723981&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n* Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the [[licensing]] of course-pack copies.<ref name=PrincetonUP>{{cite court |litigants=Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services |vol=99 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1381 |pinpoint= |court=6th Cir. |date=1996 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/99_F3d_1381.htm |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}''</ref>\n\nCourts recognize that certain kinds of market harm do not negate fair use, such as when a parody or negative review impairs the market of the original work. Copyright considerations may not shield a work against adverse criticism.\n\n==== Additional factors ====\nAs explained by Judge Leval, courts are permitted to include additional factors in their analysis.<ref name=Leval />\n\nOne such factor is acknowledgement of the copyrighted source. Giving the name of the photographer or author may help, but it does not automatically make a use fair. While [[plagiarism]] and copyright infringement are related matters, they are not identical. '''Plagiarism (using someone's words, ideas, images, etc. without acknowledgment) is a matter of professional ethics. Copyright is a matter of law, and protects exact expression, ''not'' ideas.''' One can plagiarize even a work that is not protected by copyright, for example by passing off a line from Shakespeare as one's own. Conversely, attribution prevents accusations of plagiarism, but it does not prevent infringement of copyright. For example, reprinting a copyrighted book without permission, while citing the original author, would be copyright infringement but not plagiarism.\n\n=== U.S. fair use procedure and practice ===\nThe U.S. Supreme Court described fair use as an [[affirmative defense]] in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]''<ref name=\"510 US 569\"/> This means that in [[litigation]] on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of raising and proving]] that the use was fair and not an infringement. Thus, fair use need not even be raised as a defense unless the plaintiff first shows (or the defendant concedes) a \"[[prima facie]]\" case of copyright infringement. If the work was not copyrightable, the term had expired, or the defendant's work [[de minimis|borrowed only a small amount]], for instance, then the plaintiff cannot make out a ''prima facie'' case of infringement, and the defendant need not even raise the fair use defense. In addition, fair use is only one of many limitations, exceptions, and defenses to copyright infringement. Thus, a ''prima facie'' case can be defeated without relying on fair use. For instance, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] establishes that it is legal, using certain technologies, to make copies of audio recordings for non-commercial personal use.<ref>See [[s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 10/Section 1008|USC October 17, 1008]], amended by the [[Audio Home Recording Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners claim infringement even in circumstances where the fair use defense would likely succeed, in hopes that the user will refrain from the use rather than spending resources in their defense. [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP) cases such as these\u2014alleging copyright infringement, patent infringement, defamation, or libel\u2014often come into conflict with the defendant's right to [[freedom of speech]], and has prompted some jurisdictions to pass anti-SLAPP legislation which raises the plaintiff's burdens and risk.\n\nAlthough fair use ostensibly permits certain uses without liability, many content creators and publishers try to avoid a potential court battle by seeking a legally unnecessary license from copyright owners for ''any'' use of non-public domain material, even in situations where a fair use defense would likely succeed. The simple reason is that the license terms negotiated with the copyright owner may be much less expensive than defending against a copyright suit, or having the mere possibility of a lawsuit threaten the publication of a work in which a publisher has invested significant resources.\n\nFair use rights take precedence over the author's interest. Thus the copyright holder cannot use a non-binding disclaimer, or notification, to revoke the right of fair use on works. However, binding agreements such as contracts or licence agreements may take precedence over fair use rights.<ref>''Wall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept'' (9th Cir. May 17, 2006) ([http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2006/05/16/0356559.pdf PDF] at Ninth Circuit).</ref>\n\nThe practical effect of the fair use doctrine is that a number of conventional uses of copyrighted works are not considered infringing. For instance, quoting from a copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it or teach students about it, is considered a fair use. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though they may sell their review commercially; but a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.\n\nFair use is decided on a case by case basis, on the entirety of circumstances. The same act done by different means or for a different purpose can gain or lose fair use status. Even repeating an identical act at a different time can make a difference due to changing social, technological, or other surrounding circumstances.<ref name=Unbundling /><ref name=\"grand-upright\"/>\n\n== Fair use in particular areas ==\n=== Computer code ===\nThe case ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'' revolves around the use of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) used to define functionality of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language, created by [[Sun Microsystems]] and now owned by [[Oracle Corporation]]. [[Google]] used the APIs definition and their [[structure, sequence and organization]] (SSO) in creating the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] to support the mobile device market. Oracle had sued Google in 2010 over both patent and copyright violations, but after two cycles, the case matter was narrowed down to whether Google's use of the definition and SSO of Oracle's Java APIs (determined to be copyrightable) was within fair use. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against Google, stating that while Google could defend its use in the nature of the copyrighted work, its use was not transformative, and more significantly, it commercially harmed Oracle as they were also seeking entry to the mobile market. The case, should this ruling hold, could have a significant impact on developing products for [[interoperability]] using APIs, such as with many [[open source]] projects.\n\n=== Documentary films ===\nIn April 2006, the filmmakers of the [[Loose Change]] series were served with a lawsuit by [[Jules and G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet]] over the film's use of their footage, specifically footage of the firefighters discussing the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].\nWith the help of an intellectual property lawyer, the creators of Loose Change successfully argued that a majority of the footage used was for historical purposes and was significantly transformed in the context of the film. They agreed to remove a few shots that were used as B-roll and served no purpose to the greater discussion. The case was settled and a potential multimillion-dollar lawsuit was avoided.\n\n[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]] also relied on fair use to feature several clips from copyrighted Hollywood productions. The director had originally planned to license these clips from their studio owners but discovered that studio licensing agreements would have prohibited him from using this material to criticize the entertainment industry. This prompted him to invoke the fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material to provide analysis and criticism of published works.\n\n=== File sharing ===\nIn 2009, fair use appeared as a defense in [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|lawsuits against filesharing]].

Arriba Soft Corp.]],'' provides and develops the relationship between [[thumbnails]], [[inline linking]] and fair use. In the lower District Court case on a motion for [[summary judgment]], Arriba Soft's use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from Kelly's website in Arriba Soft's image [[Web search engine|search engine]] was found not to be fair use. That decision was appealed and contested by Internet rights activists such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who argued that it was fair use.\n\nOn appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found in favour of the defendant, Arriba Soft. In reaching its decision, the court utilized the statutory four-factor analysis. First, it found the purpose of creating the thumbnail images as previews to be sufficiently transformative, noting that they were not meant to be viewed at high resolution as the original artwork was. Second, the photographs had already been published, diminishing the significance of their nature as creative works. Third, although normally making a \"full\" replication of a copyrighted work may appear to violate copyright, here it was found to be reasonable and necessary in light of the intended use. Lastly, the court found that the market for the original photographs would not be substantially diminished by the creation of the thumbnails. To the contrary, the thumbnail searches could increase the exposure of the originals. In looking at all these factors as a whole, the court found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on July 7, 2003. The remaining issues were resolved with a [[default judgment]] after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.\n\nIn August 2008, Judge [[Jeremy Fogel]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected \"fair use\" of the copyrighted material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz, a writer and editor from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who made a home video of her thirteen-month-old son dancing to Prince's song [[Let's Go Crazy]] and posted the video on [[YouTube]]. Four months later, [[Universal Music]], the owner of the copyright to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and she demanded that it be restored. YouTube complied after six weeks, rather than the two weeks required by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz then sued Universal Music in California for her legal costs, claiming the music company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video that represented fair use of the song.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Egelko|title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Woman-can-sue-over-YouTube-clip-de-posting-3199389.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 21, 2008|accessdate=2015-11-16}}</ref> On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a copyright owner must affirmatively consider whether the complained of conduct constituted fair use before sending a takedown notice under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], rather than waiting for the alleged infringer to assert fair use. 801 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2015). \"Even if, as Universal urges, fair use is classified as an 'affirmative defense,' we hold\u2014for the purposes of the DMCA\u2014fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses. We conclude that because 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is \"authorized by the law\" and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under \u00a7 512(c).\"\n\nIn June 2011, Judge [[Philip Pro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada|District of Nevada]] ruled in ''[[Righthaven v. Hoehn]]'' that the posting of an entire editorial article from the [[Las Vegas Review Journal]] in a comment as part of an online discussion was unarguably fair use. Judge Pro noted that \"Noncommercial, nonprofit use is presumptively fair. ... Hoehn posted the Work as part of an online discussion. ... This purpose is consistent with comment, for which 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 provides fair use protection. ... It is undisputed that Hoehn posted the entire work in his comment on the Website. ... wholesale copying does not preclude a finding of fair use. ... there is no genuine issue of material fact that Hoehn's use of the Work was fair and summary judgment is appropriate.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dmlp.org/sites/citmedialaw.org/files/2011-06-20-Order%20Granting%20Mot%20to%20Dismiss%20in%20Righthave%20v%20Hoehn%20Order.pdf|title=Righthaven v.

Such insurance protects against errors and omissions made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. Before the ''Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use'' was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain errors and omissions insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. This meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. In many cases, it was impossible to license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. Soon after the best practices statement was released, all errors and omissions insurers in the U.S. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.<ref name=Aufderheide>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226032283}}</ref>\n\n=== Music sampling ===\n{{further|Legal issues surrounding music sampling}}\nBefore 1991, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in certain genres of music was accepted practice and the copyright considerations were viewed as largely irrelevant.

Dimension Films |vol=230 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion= |pinpoint=841 |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}</ref> This left the door open for the ''[[de minimis]]'' doctrine, for short or unrecognizable samples; such uses would not rise to the level of copyright infringement, because under the ''de minimis'' doctrine, \"the law does not care about trifles.\" However, 3 years later, the Sixth Circuit effectively eliminated the ''de minimis'' doctrine in the ''[[Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films]]'' case, holding that artists must \"get a license or do not sample\".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Bridgeport Music, Inc. v.

These fair use cases distinguish between parodies, which use a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself and [[satire]], or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.\n\nFor example, when [[Tom Forsythe]] appropriated [[Barbie]] dolls for his photography project \"Food Chain Barbie\" (depicting several copies of the doll naked and disheveled and about to be baked in an oven, blended in a food mixer, and the like), [[Mattel]] lost its copyright infringement lawsuit against him because his work effectively parodies Barbie and the values she represents.<ref name=\"Mattel\">{{cite court|litigants=Mattel Inc v.

Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]''<ref name=\"510 US 569\"/> the U.S. Supreme Court recognized parody as a potential fair use, even when done for profit. [[Roy Orbison]]'s publisher, [[Acuff-Rose Music]], had sued [[2 Live Crew]] in 1989 for their use of Orbison's \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" in a mocking rap version with altered lyrics. The Supreme Court viewed 2 Live Crew's version as a ridiculing commentary on the earlier work, and ruled that when the parody was itself the product rather than mere advertising, commercial nature did not bar the defense. The ''Campbell'' court also distinguished parodies from [[satire]], which they described as a broader social critique not intrinsically tied to ridicule of a specific work and so not deserving of the same use exceptions as parody because the satirist's ideas are capable of expression without the use of the other particular work.\n\nA number of appellate decisions have recognized that a parody may be a protected fair use, including the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]] (''[[Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.]]''); the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] (''Mattel v. Walking Mountain Productions''); and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits (''[[Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.]]''). In the 2001 ''Suntrust Bank'' case, Suntrust Bank and the [[Margaret Mitchell]] estate unsuccessfully brought suit to halt the publication of ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which reused many of the characters and situations from ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' but told the events from the point of view of the enslaved people rather than the slaveholders. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]], applying ''Campbell'', found that ''The Wind Done Gone'' was fair use and vacated the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia|district court's]] injunction against its publication.\n\nCases in which a satirical use was found to be fair include ''Blanch v. Koons'' and ''Williams v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems''.<ref name=Unbundling />\n\n=== Text and data mining ===\nThe transformative nature of computer based analytical processes such as [[text mining]], [[web mining]] and [[data mining]] has led many to form the view that such uses would be protected under fair use. This view was substantiated by the rulings of Judge [[Denny Chin]] in ''[[Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'', a case involving mass digitisation of millions of books from research library collections. As part of the ruling that found the book digitisation project was fair use, the judge stated \"Google Books is also transformative in the sense that it has transformed book text into data for purposes of substantive research, including data mining and text mining in new areas\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosati|first1=Eleonora|title=A Closer Look at the Google Books Library Project Decision|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/a-closer-look-at-google-books-library.html|accessdate=November 15, 2014|publisher=The IPKAT|date=November 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name=GoogleVictory>{{cite web|title=Google's Fair Use Victory|url=http://www.lawdownunder.com/google-books-project-covered-fair-use-doctrine/|website=Law Down Under|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nText and data mining was subject to further review in ''[[Authors Guild v.

For widespread adoption it must also be able to fly without a qualified [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] at the controls and come at affordable purchase and running costs.\n\n===Lift===\nMany types of aircraft technologies and form factors have been tried. The simplest and earliest approach was to give a driveable car added, bolt-on fixed flying surfaces and propeller. However such a design must either tow its removable parts on a separate trailer behind it, or return to its last landing point before taking off again. Other conventional takeoff fixed-wing designs include folding wings, which the car carries with it when on the road.\n\nVertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) designs include [[rotorcraft]] with folding blades, as well as ducted-fan and [[tiltrotor]] vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/13/terrafugia_tfx_followup/|title=Your Flying Car?

To date, no vertical takeoff and landing ([[VTOL]]) vehicle has ever demonstrated adequate road capabilities.\n\nThe [[autogyro]] has an unpowered lifting rotor, relying on its forward airspeed to generate lift. For road use it requires a folding rotor. Designs such as the [[PAL-V]] are currently being explored.\n\n===Safety===\nAlthough statistically, commercial flying is much safer than driving, unlike commercial planes personal flying cars might not have as many safety checks and their pilots would not be as well trained. Humans already have problems with the aspect of driving in two dimensions (forward and backwards, side to side), adding in the up and down aspect would make \"driving\" or flying as it would be, much more difficult; however, this problem might be solved via the sole use of self-flying and [[Self-driving car|self-driving]] cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/5-reasons-you-dont-want-flying-car.htm#page=1|title=Top 5 Reasons You Don't Want a Flying Car: Flying Can Be a Scary Event|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref> In [[mid-air collision]]s and mechanical failures, the aircraft could fall from the sky or go through an emergency landing, resulting in deaths and property damage.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/5-reasons-you-dont-want-flying-car.htm#page=3 |title=Top 5 Reasons You Don't Want a Flying Car: Breaking Down Means Falling Out of the Sky|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref> In addition, poor weather conditions, such as low air density, lightning storms and heavy rain, snow or fog could be challenging and affect the aircraft's aerodynamics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/5-reasons-you-dont-want-flying-car.htm#page=4|title=Top 5 Reasons You Don't Want a Flying Car: Flying Cars Are Hard to Drive in Bad Weather|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nA major problem, which increases rapidly with wider adoption, is the risk of mid-air collisions. Another is the unscheduled or emergency landing of a flying car on an unprepared location beneath, including the possibility of accident debris. Regulatory regimes are being developed in anticipation of a large increase in the numbers of [[roadable aircraft]] and [[personal air vehicle]]s in the near future, and compliance with these regimes will be necessary for safe flight.\n\nMechanically, the challenges of flight are so strict that every opportunity must be taken to keep weight to a  minimum and a typical airframe is lightweight and easily damaged. On the other hand a road vehicle must be able to withstand significant impact loads from casual incidents as well as low-speed and high-speed impacts, and the high strength this demands can add considerable weight. A practical flying car must be both strong enough to pass road safety standards and light enough to fly.\n\n===Environment===\nA flying car capable of widespread use must operate safely within a heavily populated urban environment. The lift and propulsion systems must be quiet, and have safety shrouds around all moving parts such as rotors, and must not create excessive pollution.\n\n===Control===\nA basic flying car requires the person at the controls to be both a qualified road driver and aircraft pilot. This is impractical for the majority of people and so wider adoption will require computer systems to de-skill piloting. These include aircraft maneuvering, navigation and emergency procedures, all in potentially crowded airspace. [[Fly-by-wire]] computers can also make up for many deficiencies in flight dynamics, such as stability. A practical flying car may need to be a fully [[autonomous vehicle]] in which people are present only as passengers.\n\n===Cost===\nThe need for the propulsion system to be both small and powerful can at present only be met using advanced and expensive technologies. The cost of manufacture could therefore be as much as 10 million dollars.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Millennium Book: Your Essential All-purpose Guide to the Year 2000|author=Gail Collins|author2=Dan Collins|date=1 December 1990|publisher=Main Street Books|isbn=978-0-385-41165-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZGZPAAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nFlying cars would be used for shorter distances, at higher frequency, and at lower speeds and lower altitudes than conventional passenger aircraft. However optimal fuel efficiency for airplanes is obtained at high altitudes and high subsonic speeds, so a flying car's energy efficiency would be low compared to a conventional aircraft.<ref>Barney L.

The term is derived from the traditional process of working with [[film stock|film]] which increasingly involves the use of digital technology.\n\nThe '''film editor''' works with the raw [[footage]], selecting [[Shot (filming)|shots]] and combines them into [[Sequence (filmmaking)|sequences]] which create a finished [[Film|motion picture]]. Film editing is described as an art or skill, the only art that is unique to cinema, separating filmmaking from other art forms that preceded it, although there are close parallels to the editing process in other art forms such as poetry and novel writing. Film editing is often referred to as the \"invisible art\"<ref>Harris, Mark. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06harr.html \"Which Editing is a Cut Above?\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (January 6, 2008)</ref> because when it is well-practiced, the viewer can become so engaged that he or she is not aware of the editor's work.\n\nOn its most fundamental level, film editing is the [[art]], technique and practice of assembling shots into a coherent sequence. The job of an editor is not simply to mechanically put pieces of a film together, cut off film [[clapperboard|slates]] or edit dialogue scenes. A film editor must creatively work with the layers of images, story, dialogue, music, pacing, as well as the actors' performances to effectively \"re-imagine\" and even rewrite the film to craft a cohesive whole. Editors usually play a dynamic role in the making of a film. Sometimes, auteurist [[film director]]s edit their own films, for example, [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Bahram Beyzai]] and [[Coen brothers|the Coen Brothers]].\n\nWith the advent of digital editing, film editors and their assistants have become responsible for many areas of filmmaking that used to be the responsibility of others. For instance, in past years, picture editors dealt only with just that\u2014picture. Sound, music, and (more recently) visual effects editors dealt with the practicalities of other aspects of the editing process, usually under the direction of the picture editor and director. However, digital systems have increasingly put these responsibilities on the picture editor. It is common, especially on lower budget films, for the editor to sometimes cut in makeshift music, mock up visual effects and add temporary sound effects or other sound replacements. These temporary elements are usually replaced with more refined final elements produced by the sound, music and visual effects teams hired to complete the picture.\n\n==History==\nEarly films were short films that were one long, static, and [[locked-down]] shot. Motion in the shot was all that was necessary to amuse an audience, so the first films simply showed activity such as traffic moving on a city street. There was no story and no editing. Each film ran as long as there was film in the camera.\n\n[[File:M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Un homme de t\u00eates (Star Film 167 1898).jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot from ''[[The Four Troublesome Heads]]'', one of the first films to feature [[multiple exposure]]s.]]\n\nThe use of film editing to establish continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.<ref name=\"BFIso01\">{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref> In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1896 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. One of the first films to use this technique, [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]'s ''[[The Four Troublesome Heads]]'' from 1898, was produced with Paul's camera.\n\nThe further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899-1900 at the [[Brighton|Brighton School]] in[England, where it was definitively established by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]. In that year, Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene.\n\n[[File:Williamson Fire.ogv|thumb|left|250px|Excerpt from the movie ''Fire!'' directed by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]]]\n\nEven more remarkable was [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'', made around the same time in 1900. The first shot shows the gate to the mission station from the outside being attacked and broken open by Chinese [[Boxer rebellion|Boxer rebels]], then there is a cut to the garden of the [[Siege of the International Legations|mission station]] where a pitched battle ensues. An armed party of British sailors arrived to defeat the Boxers and rescue the missionary's family. The film used the first \"[[reverse angle]]\" cut in film history.\n\nJames Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'' and ''Fire!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two filmmakers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552|title=The Brighton School|accessdate=2012-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113027/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Great Train Robbery 0018.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Scene from ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), directed by [[Edwin Stanton Porter]]]]\nOther filmmakers then took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter worked on a number of minor films before making ''[[Life of an American Fireman]]'' in 1903. The film was the first American film with a plot, featuring action, and even a closeup of a hand pulling a fire alarm. The film comprised a continuous narrative over seven scenes, rendered in a total of nine shots.<ref name=\"musser\">Originally in ''Edison Films'' catalog, February 1903, 2\u20133; reproduced in Charles Musser, ''Before the Nickelodeon: Edwin S. Porter and the Edison Manufacturing Company'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 216\u201318.</ref> He put a dissolve between every shot, just as [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] editing method to show simultaneous action in different places.\n\nThese early film directors discovered important aspects of motion picture language: that the screen image does not need to show a complete person from head to toe and that splicing together two shots creates in the viewer's mind a contextual relationship. These were the key discoveries that made all non-live or non live-on-videotape narrative motion pictures and television possible\u2014that shots (in this case, whole scenes since each shot is a complete scene) can be photographed at widely different locations over a period of time (hours, days or even months) and combined into a narrative whole.<ref>[[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] (1957). p. 25.</ref> That is, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' contains scenes shot on sets of a telegraph station, a railroad car interior, and a dance hall, with outdoor scenes at a railroad water tower, on the train itself, at a point along the track, and in the woods. But when the robbers leave the telegraph station interior (set) and emerge at the water tower, the audience believes they went immediately from one to the other. Or that when they climb on the train in one shot and enter the baggage car (a set) in the next, the audience believes they are on the same train.\n\nSometime around 1918, [[Russians|Russian]] director [[Lev Kuleshov]] did an experiment that proves this point. (See [[Kuleshov Experiment]]) He took an old film clip of a head shot of a noted Russian actor and intercut the shot with a shot of a bowl of soup, then with a child playing with a teddy bear, then with a shot an elderly woman in a casket. When he showed the film to people they praised the actor's acting\u2014the hunger in his face when he saw the soup, the delight in the child, and the grief when looking at the dead woman.<ref>[[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] (1957). pp. 72\u201373.</ref> Of course, the shot of the actor was years before the other shots and he never \"saw\" any of the items. The simple act of juxtaposing the shots in a sequence made the relationship.\n\n[[Image:FirstMoviola.jpg|thumb|237px|The original editing machine: an upright [[Moviola]].]]\n\n===Film editing technology===\nBefore the widespread use of [[non-linear editing system]]s, the initial editing of all films was done with a positive copy of the film negative called a film [[workprint]] (cutting copy in UK) by physically cutting and pasting together pieces of film. Strips of footage would be hand cut and attached together with tape and then later in time, glue. Editors were very precise; if they made a wrong cut or needed a fresh positive print, it cost them money for the lab to reprint the footage and push the editing process back farther. With the invention of a splicer and threading machine with a viewer such as a [[Moviola]], or [[Flatbed editor|\"flatbed\" machine]] such as a K.-E.-M. or [[Steenbeck]], the editing process sped up a little bit and cut came out cleaner and more precise. Flatbed editing machines, particularly the Steenbeck, became industry standard equipment in film-based television production and were used extensively for documentary and drama production within the BBC's Film Department. Operated by a team of two, an editor and assistant editor, this tactile process required significant skill but allowed for editors to work extremely efficiently.<ref>Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare. Collection.https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1</ref>\n\n[[File:16mm editing synchroniser 1980's 1.jpg|thumbnail|Acmade Picsynch for sound and picture coordination]]\nToday, most films are edited digitally (on systems such as [[Avid Technology|Avid]], [[Final Cut Pro]] or [[Premiere Pro]]) and bypass the film positive workprint altogether. In the past, the use of a film positive (not the original negative) allowed the editor to do as much experimenting as he or she wished, without the risk of damaging the original. With digital editing, editors can experiment just as much as before except with the footage completely transferred to a computer hard drive.\n\nWhen the film workprint had been cut to a satisfactory state, it was then used to make an edit decision list (EDL). The negative cutter referred to this list while processing the negative, splitting the shots into rolls, which were then contact printed to produce the final film print or [[answer print]]. Today, production companies have the option of bypassing negative cutting altogether. With the advent of digital intermediate (\"DI\"), the physical negative does not necessarily need to be physically cut and hot spliced together; rather the negative is optically scanned into computer(s) and a cut list is conformed by a DI editor.\n\n=== Women in film editing ===\nIn the early years of film, editing was considered a technical job; editors were expected to \"cut out the bad bits\" and string the film together. Indeed, when the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] was formed, they chose to be \"below the line\", that is, not a creative guild, but a technical one. This was very helpful to women. Women were not usually able to break into the \"creative\" positions; directors, cinematographers, producers, and executives were almost always men. Editing afforded creative women a place to assert their mark on the film making process. The [[history of film]] has included many women editors such as [[Dede Allen]], [[Anne Bauchens]], [[Margaret Booth]], [[Barbara McLean]], [[Anne V. Coates]], [[Adrienne Fazan]], [[Verna Fields]], [[Blanche Sewell]] and [[Eda Warren]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://via.hypothes.is/http://critics-associated.com/a-tedious-job-women-and-film-editing/|title=\"A Tedious Job\" \u2013 Women and Film Editing|last=Galv\u00e3o|first=Sara|date=March 15, 2015|website=Critics Associated via.hypothes.is|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n\n== Post-production ==\n{{main|Post-production}}\n{{see also|Rough cut|Offline editing|Online editing}}\n\nPost-production editing may be summarized by three distinct phases commonly referred to as the [[editor's cut]], the [[director's cut]], and the [[final cut privilege|final cut]].\n\nThere are several editing stages and the editor's cut is the first. An editor's cut (sometimes referred to as the \"Assembly edit\" or \"Rough cut\") is normally the first pass of what the final film will be when it reaches [[picture lock]]. The film editor usually starts working while principal photography starts. Likely, prior to cutting, the editor and director will have seen and discussed \"[[dailies]]\" (raw footage shot each day) as shooting progresses. Screening dailies gives the editor a general idea of the director's intentions. Because it is the first pass, the editor's cut might be longer than the final film. The editor continues to refine the cut while shooting continues, and often the entire editing process goes on for many months and sometimes more than a year, depending on the film.\n\nWhen shooting is finished, the [[Film director|director]] can then turn his or her full attention to collaborating with the editor and further refining the cut of the film. This is the time that is set aside where the film editor's first cut is molded to fit the director's vision. In the United States, under the rules of the [[Directors Guild of America]], directors receive a minimum of ten weeks after completion of principal photography to prepare their first cut. While collaborating on what is referred to as the \"director's cut\", the director and the editor go over the entire movie in great detail; scenes and shots are re-ordered, removed, shortened and otherwise tweaked. Often it is discovered that there are [[plot hole]]s, missing shots or even missing segments which might require that new scenes be filmed. Because of this time working closely and collaborating&nbsp;&ndash; a period that is normally far longer and more intricately detailed than the entire preceding film production&nbsp;&ndash; many directors and editors form a unique artistic bond.\n\nOften after the director has had their chance to oversee a cut, the subsequent cuts are supervised by one or more producers, who represent the production company or [[movie studio]]. There have been several conflicts in the past between the director and the studio, sometimes leading to the use of the \"[[Alan Smithee]]\" credit signifying when a director no longer wants to be associated with the final release.\n\n== Methods of montage ==\n{{main|Montage (filmmaking)}}\nIn [[motion picture terminology]], a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] (from the French for \"putting together\" or \"assembly\") is a film editing technique.\n\nThere are at least three senses of the term:\n# In [[French film]] practice, \"montage\" has its literal French meaning (assembly, installation) and simply identifies editing.\n# In [[Soviet film]]making of the 1920s, \"montage\" was a method of juxtaposing shots to derive new meaning that did not exist in either shot alone.\n# In [[classical Hollywood cinema]], a \"[[montage sequence]]\" is a short segment in a film in which narrative information is presented in a condensed fashion.\n\nAlthough film director [[David Wark Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] was not part of the montage school, he was one of the early proponents of the power of editing&nbsp;\u2014 mastering [[cross-cutting]] to show parallel action in different locations, and codifying film grammar in other ways as well. Griffith's work in the teens was highly regarded by Kuleshov and other Soviet filmmakers and greatly influenced their understanding of editing.\n\n[[Lev Kuleshov]] was among the very first to [[Soviet montage theory|theorize about the relatively young medium of the cinema]] in the 1920s. For him, the unique essence of the cinema&nbsp;\u2014 that which could be duplicated in no other medium&nbsp;\u2014 is editing. He argues that editing a film is like constructing a building. Brick-by-brick (shot-by-shot) the building (film) is erected. His often-cited [[Kuleshov Experiment]] established that montage can lead the viewer to reach certain conclusions about the action in a film. Montage works because viewers infer meaning based on context. [[Sergei Eisenstein]] was briefly a student of Kuleshov's, but the two parted ways because they had different ideas of montage. Eisenstein regarded montage as a [[dialectic]]al means of creating meaning. By contrasting unrelated shots he tried to provoke associations in the viewer, which were induced by shocks.\n\nA [[montage sequence]] consists of a series of short shots that are edited into a sequence to condense narrative. It is usually used to advance the story as a whole (often to suggest the passage of time), rather than to create symbolic meaning. In many cases, a song plays in the background to enhance the mood or reinforce the message being conveyed. One famous example of montage was seen in the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', depicting the start of man's first development from apes to humans. Another example that is employed in many films is the sports montage. The sports montage shows the star athlete training over a period of time, each shot having more improvement than the last. Classic examples include Rocky and the Karate Kid.\n\n== Continuity editing and alternatives ==\n{{main|Continuity editing}}\n\nContinuity is a term for the consistency of on-screen elements over the course of a scene or film, such as whether an actor's costume remains the same from one scene to the next, or whether a glass of milk held by a character is full or empty throughout the scene.  Because films are typically shot out of sequence, the [[script supervisor]] will keep a record of continuity and provide that to the film editor for reference.  The editor may try to maintain continuity of elements, or may intentionally create a discontinuous sequence for stylistic or narrative effect.\n\nThe technique of continuity editing, part of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] style, was developed by early European and American directors, in particular, [[David Wark Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] in his films such as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]''. The classical style embraces temporal and spatial continuity as a way of advancing narrative, using such techniques as the [[180 degree rule]], [[Establishing shot]], and [[Shot reverse shot]].\n\nEarly Russian filmmakers such as [[Lev Kuleshov]] further explored and theorized about editing and its ideological nature. [[Sergei Eisenstein]] developed a system of editing that was unconcerned with the rules of the continuity system of classical Hollywood that he called [[Intellectual montage]].\n\nAlternatives to traditional editing were also explored by early [[surrealist]] and [[Dada]] filmmakers such as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] (director of the 1929 ''Un Chien Andalou'') and [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (director of 1924's ''Entr'acte'' which starred famous Dada artists [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]]).\n\nThe [[French New Wave]] filmmakers such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and their American counterparts such as [[Andy Warhol]] and [[John Cassavetes]] also pushed the limits of editing technique during the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s. French New Wave films and the [[non-narrative film]]s of the 1960s used a carefree editing style and did not conform to the traditional editing etiquette of Hollywood films. Like its Dada and surrealist predecessors, [[French New Wave]] editing often drew attention to itself by its lack of continuity, its demystifying self-reflexive nature (reminding the audience that they were watching a film), and by the overt use of [[jump cut]]s or the insertion of material not often related to any narrative.\n\nSince the late 20th century [[Post-classical editing]] has seen faster editing styles with nonlinear, discontinuous action.\n\n== Significance ==\n[[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] noted that the editing process is the one phase of production that is truly unique to motion pictures. Every other aspect of film making originated in a different medium than film (photography, art direction, writing, sound recording), but editing is the one process that is unique to film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] was quoted as saying: \"I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of film making. If I wanted to be frivolous, I might say that everything that precedes editing is merely a way of producing film to edit.\"<ref>Walker, Alexander (1972). ''Stanley Kubrick Directs'', New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich{{page?|date=September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to writer-director [[Preston Sturges]]: <blockquote>[T]here is a law of natural cutting and that this replicates what an audience in a legitimate theater does for itself.  The more nearly the film cutter approaches this law of natural interest, the more invisible will be his cutting. If the camera moves from one person to another at the exact moment that one in the legitimate theatre would have turned his head, one will not be conscious of a cut. If the camera misses by a quarter of a second, one will get a jolt. There is one other requirement: the two shots must be approximately of the same tone value. If one cuts from black to white, it is jarring. At any given moment, the camera must point at the exact spot the audience wishes to look at. To find that spot is absurdly easy: one has only to remember where one was looking at the time the scene was made.<ref>{{cite sturges}}, p. 275</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Assistant editors ==\n{{More citations needed|section|small=y|date=August 2016}}\nAssistant editors aid the editor and director in collecting and organizing all the elements needed to edit the film. When editing is finished, they oversee the various lists and instructions necessary to put the film into its final form. Editors of large budget features will usually have a team of assistants working for them. The first assistant editor is in charge of this team, and may do a small bit of picture editing as well, if necessary. The other assistants will have set tasks, usually helping each other when necessary to complete the many time-sensitive tasks at hand. In addition, an apprentice editor may be on hand to help the assistants. An apprentice is usually someone who is learning the ropes of assisting.\n\nTelevision shows typically have one assistant per editor. This assistant is responsible for every task required to bring the show to final form. Lower budget features and documentaries will also commonly have only one assistant.\n\nThe organizational aspects job could best be compared to database management. When a film is shot, every piece of picture or sound is coded with numbers and [[timecode]]. It is the assistant's job to keep track of these numbers in a database, which, in non-linear editing, is linked to the computer program. The editor and director cut the film using digital copies of the original film and sound, commonly referred to as an \"offline\" edit. When the cut is finished, it is the assistant's job to bring the film or television show \"online\". They create lists and instructions that tell the picture and sound finishers how to put the edit back together with the high quality original elements. Assistant editing can be seen as a career path to eventually becoming an editor. Many assistants, however, do not choose to pursue advancement to editor, and are very happy at the assistant level, working long and rewarding careers on many films and television shows.\n\n== See also ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Two Editing Tables\n| width     = 287\n| image1    = Film editing table (5201101743).jpg\n| image2    = Film editing table (5201693172).jpg\n}}\n\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[180 degree rule]]\n* [[30 degree rule]]\n* [[A Roll]] (Footage)\n* [[B Roll]]\n* [[Cinematic techniques]]\n*[[Clapperboard]]\n* [[Compositing]] (Keying)\n* [[Cut (transition)]], for the director's call ''Cut!'' or stop\n** [[Axial cut]]\n** [[Cross-cutting]]\n** [[Fast cutting]]\n** [[Jump cut]]\n** [[Long take]]\n** [[Match cut]]\n** [[Slow cutting]]\n* [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|Cutaway]]\n* ''[[The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Movie Editing]]''\n* [[Edit decision list]] (EDL)\n* '''[[Film transition]]'''\n** [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|Dissolve]]\n** [[L cut]] (split edit)\n** [[Wipe (transition)|Wipe]]\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Filmmaking]]\n* [[Kuleshov Effect]]\n* [[List of film topics|List of film-related topics]]\n* [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] (MPEG)\n* [[Motion picture terminology]]\n* [[Moviola]]\n* [[Negative cutting]]\n* [[Re-edited film]]\n* [[Scene (film)|Scene]]\n* [[Sequence (filmmaking)|Sequence]]\n* '''[[Shot (filmmaking)|Shot]]'''\n** [[Crane shot]]\n** [[Establishing shot]]\n** [[Insert (filmmaking)|Insert]]\n** [[Master shot]]\n** [[Point of view shot]]\n** [[Shot reverse shot]]\n* [[Video editing]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Dmytryk, Edward (1984).

In 1823 W\u00f6hler finished his study of medicine in [[Heidelberg]] at the laboratory of [[Leopold Gmelin]], who arranged for him to work under [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. He taught chemistry from 1826 to 1831 at the Polytechnic School in Berlin until 1839 when he was stationed at the [[Polytechnic School]] at [[Kassel]]. Afterwards, he became Ordinary Professor of Chemistry in the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], where he remained until his death in 1882. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\n==Contributions to chemistry==\nW\u00f6hler is regarded as a pioneer in [[organic chemistry]] as a result of his (accidentally) synthesizing  [[urea]] from [[ammonium cyanate]] in the [[W\u00f6hler synthesis]] in 1828.<ref name=Wohler/>\nThis discovery has become celebrated as a refutation of [[vitalism]], the hypothesis that living things are alive because of some special \"vital force\". However, contemporary accounts do not support that notion. This ''W\u00f6hler Myth'', as historian of science Peter J. Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, \"ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned W\u00f6hler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'\".<ref>{{harvnb|Cheng|2005|p=1}} cites {{harvnb|Ramberg|2000|pp=170\u2013195}}.</ref><ref>\"Ramberg (2000), following Rocke (1993), pp. 239\u2013241, traced back the origin to H. Kopp\u2019s ''Geschichte der Chemie'', Vol. 1 (1843), p. 442; vol. 4 (1847), p. 244. The myth was unmasked by McKie in 1944, followed by a series of papers quoted by Ramberg\"  {{harv|Schummer|2003 |p=718}}.</ref>  Nevertheless, it was the beginning of the end of one popular vitalist hypothesis, that of [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]], that \"organic\" compounds could be made only by living things.\n\n==Major works, discoveries and research==\nW\u00f6hler was also known for being a co-discoverer of [[beryllium]], [[silicon]] and [[silicon nitride]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Deville |first=H. |last2=Wohler |first2=F. | year =1857| title= Erstmalige Erw\u00e4hnung von Si3N4| journal = Liebigs Ann. Chem. | volume = 104| page = 256}}</ref> as well as the synthesis of [[calcium carbide]], among others. In 1834, W\u00f6hler and [[Justus Liebig]] published an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds. They proved by their experiments that a group of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] [[atom]]s can behave like an element, take the place of an element, and be exchanged for elements in [[chemical compound]]s. Thus the foundation was laid of the doctrine of [[Radical theory|compound radicals]], a doctrine which had a profound influence on the development of chemistry.\n\nSince the discovery of [[potassium]] by [[Humphry Davy]], it had been assumed that [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]], the basis of [[clay]], contained a metal in combination with oxygen. Davy, [[\u00d8rsted]], and [[Berzelius]] attempted the extraction of this metal, but failed. W\u00f6hler then worked on the same subject, and discovered the metal [[aluminium]] in 1827. To him also is due the isolation of the elements [[yttrium]], [[beryllium]], and [[titanium]], the observation that \"silicium\" ([[silicon]]) can be obtained in crystals, and that some meteoric stones contain organic matter. He analyzed [[meteorite]]s, and for many years wrote the digest on the literature of meteorites in the ''[[Jahresberichte \u00fcber die Fortschritte der Chemie]]''; he possessed the best private collection of meteoric stones and irons existing. W\u00f6hler and [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville|Sainte Claire Deville]] discovered the crystalline form of boron, and W\u00f6hler and Heinrich Buff discovered [[silane]] in 1856. W\u00f6hler also prepared urea, a constituent of urine, from ammonium cyanate in the laboratory without the help of a living cell.\n\n==Final days and legacy==\nW\u00f6hler's discoveries had great influence on the theory of chemistry. The journals of every year from 1820 to 1881 contain contributions from him. In the ''[[Scientific American]]'' supplement for 1882, it was remarked that \"for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain, but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming. Had he never lived, the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now\".<ref>[http://www.fullbooks.com/Scientific-American-Supplement-No-3621.html Scientific American Supplement No. 362, 9 Dec 1882].

Funk de-emphasizes [[melody]] and [[chord progressions]] used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic [[groove (music)|groove]] of a [[bass line]] played by an [[electric bass]]ist and a drum part played by a [[drum kit|drummer]] to the foreground. Like much of [[Music of Africa|African-inspired music]], funk typically consists of a complex groove with [[Rhythm section|rhythm instruments]] playing interlocking grooves. Funk uses the same richly colored [[extended chord]]s found in [[bebop]] jazz, such as [[minor chord]]s with added sevenths and elevenths, or [[dominant seventh]] chords with altered ninths.\n\nFunk originated in the mid-1960s, with [[James Brown]]'s development of a signature groove that emphasized the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]\u2014with heavy ''emphasis on the first beat'' of every [[Bar (music)|measure]] (\"The One\"), and the application of swung [[16th note]]s  and [[syncopation]] on all bass lines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs.<ref name=\"Slutsky, Allan 1997\">Slutsky, Allan, Chuck Silverman (1997). ''The Funkmasters-the Great James Brown Rhythm Sections''. {{ISBN|1-57623-443-6}}</ref> Other musical groups, including [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[the Meters]], and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], soon began to adopt and develop Brown's innovations. While much of the [[recorded history|written history]] of funk focuses on men, there have been notable funk women, including [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Lyn Collins]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], and [[Betty Davis]].\n\nFunk derivatives include the [[psychedelic funk]] eras of [[Sly Stone]] and [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]; the [[avant-funk]] of white groups such as [[Talking Heads]] and [[the Pop Group]]; [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], a form of [[post-disco]] dance music; [[electro music]], a hybrid of electronic music and funk; [[funk metal]] (e.g., [[Living Colour]], [[Faith No More]]); G-funk, a mix of [[gangsta rap]] and funk; [[Timba]], a form of funky Cuban popular dance music; and funk jam (e.g., [[Phish]]). Funk [[sampling (music)|samples]] and [[breakbeat]]s have been used extensively in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and various forms of [[electronic dance music]], such as [[house music]], old-school rave, [[breakbeat]], and [[drum and bass]]. It is also the main influence of [[go-go]], a subgenre associated with funk.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb-FBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One|last=Vincent|first=Rickey|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-312-13499-0|location=New York|pages=293\u2013297|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Wiktionary|funk}}\nThe word ''funk'' initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin \"fumigare\" (which means \"to smoke\") via Old French \"fungiere\" and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784 \"funky\" meaning \"musty\" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of \"earthy\" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something \"deeply or strongly felt\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=funk|title=Online Etymology Dictionary \u2013 Funk|last=|first=|date=|website=Etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=funky|title=Online Etymology Dictionary \u2013 funky|last=|first=|date=|website=Etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-fun2.htm|title=World Wide Words: Funk|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=October 27, 2001|website=World Wide Words|language=en-gb|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early [[jam session]]s, musicians would encourage one another to \"[[get down]]\" by telling one another, \"Now, put some ''stank'' on it!\". At least as early as 1907, [[jazz]] songs carried titles such as ''Funky''. The first example is an unrecorded number by [[Buddy Bolden]], remembered as either \"[[Buddy Bolden#.22Funky.22|Funky Butt]]\" or \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\" with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either \"comical and light\" or \"crude and downright obscene\" but, in one way or another, referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played.<ref>Donald M.

According to one source, [[New Orleans]]-born drummer [[Earl Palmer]] \"was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable.\"<ref name=Guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/23/popandrock.usa Obituary, ''[[Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]]''</ref> The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more carnal quality.

Pictured here is [[the Meters]].]]\nA great deal of funk is rhythmically based on a two-[[cell (music)|celled]] onbeat/offbeat structure, which originated in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]]. New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own.<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">Palmer, Robert (1979: 14), ''A Tale of Two Cities: Memphis Rock and New Orleans Roll. Brooklyn.</ref> New Orleans funk, as it was called, gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 293), \"Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music\", ''Popular Music'', v. 19, n. 3, October 2000), p.&nbsp;293\u2013318.</ref>\n\n[[File:Funk.tiff|thumb|center|upright=1.8|Simple kick and snare funk motif. The kick first sounds two onbeats, which are then answered by two offbeats. The snare sounds the backbeat.]]\n\nFunk creates an intense [[Groove (popular music)|groove]] by using strong guitar riffs and [[bass line]]s. Like Motown recordings, funk songs used bass lines as the centerpiece of songs. [[Slapping (music)|Slap]] bass's mixture of thumb-slapped low notes and finger \"popped\" (or plucked) high notes allowed the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk.\n\nIn funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, using a style of picking called the \"chank\" or \"chicken scratch\",  in which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the [[fingerboard]] and then quickly released just enough to get a muted \u201cscratching\u201d sound that is produced by rapid rhythmic strumming of the opposite hand near the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musical-u.com/learn/the-funky-ones-what-makes-funk-guitar-what-it-is/|title=The Funky Ones \u2014 What Makes Funk Guitar What It Is - Musical U|date=August 15, 2016|website=Musical-u.com|accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> The result of these factors was a rhythm guitar sound that seemed to float somewhere between the low-end thump of the [[Bass guitar|electric bass]] and the cutting tone of the [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[hi-hat]]s, with a rhythmically melodic feel that fell deep in the pocket. Guitarist [[Jimmy Nolen]] developed this technique. On James Brown's \"[[Give It Up or Turnit a Loose]]\" (1969), however, Jimmy Nolen's guitar part has a bare bones tonal structure. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. The guitar is used the way that an African drum, or idiophone would be used. Note that the measures alternate between beginning on the beat, and beginning on offbeats. Also often used was the application of the [[Wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]] sound effect and muting the notes in guitar riffs to create a percussive sound. Guitarist [[Ernie Isley]] of [[the Isley Brothers]] and [[Eddie Hazel]] of [[Funkadelic]] were notably influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s improvised solos. Eddie Hazel, who worked with [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], is one of the most notable guitar soloists in funk. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Jimi Hendrix himself, when he was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived in the attic at the Isleys' household.\n\n=== Harmony ===\n[[File:Thirteenth chord collapsed.png|thumb|A [[thirteenth chord]] (E 13, which also contains a flat 7th and a 9th). {{Audio|Thirteenth chord collapsed.mid|Play}}]]\nFunk uses the same richly coloured [[extended chord]]s found in [[bebop]] jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. However, unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord [[vamp (music)|vamps]] with [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|melodo-harmonic movement]] and a complex, driving rhythmic feel. Some of the best known and most skilful soloists in funk have [[jazz]] backgrounds. Trombonist [[Fred Wesley]] and saxophonist [[Pee Wee Ellis]] and [[Maceo Parker]] are among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, with both of them working with [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].\n\nThe chords used in funk songs typically imply a [[dorian mode|dorian]] or [[mixolydian mode]], as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the [[blues scale]]. In the 1970s, jazz music drew upon funk to create a new subgenre of [[jazz-funk]], which can be heard in recordings by [[Miles Davis]] (''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'', ''[[On the Corner]]''), and [[Herbie Hancock]] (''[[Head Hunters]]'').\n\n== History ==\nThe distinctive characteristics of [[African-American music]]al expression are rooted in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]], and find their earliest expression in spirituals, work chants/songs, praise shouts, gospel, blues, and \"body rhythms\" ([[Juba dance|hambone]], [[patting juba]], and [[ring shout]] clapping and stomping patterns). Funk music is an amalgam of [[soul music]], [[soul jazz]], [[R&B]], and Afro-Cuban rhythms absorbed and reconstituted in New Orleans.  Like other styles of African-American musical expression including jazz, soul music and R&B, funk music accompanied many protest movements during and after the Civil Rights Movement. Funk allowed everyday experiences to be expressed to challenge daily struggles and hardships fought by lower and working class communities.\n\n=== New Orleans ===\n[[Gerhard Kubik]] notes that with the exception of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex [[polyrhythm]]s, and there was a \"very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns ([[bell pattern|key patterns]]) in virtually all early twentieth century African-American music&nbsp;... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African time lines.\"<ref>Kubik (1999: 51). Africa and the Blues. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the two-celled time line structure was brought into [[New Orleans blues]]. New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to [[Afro-Cuban]] influences precisely at the time when R&B was first forming.<ref>\"Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans.\" Campbell, Michael, and James Brody (2007: 83). ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction''. Schirmer. {{ISBN|0-534-64295-0}}</ref> [[Dave Bartholomew]] and [[Professor Longhair]] (Henry Roeland Byrd) incorporated Afro-Cuban instruments, as well as the [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as \"Carnival Day\" (Bartholomew 1949) and \"Mardi Gras In New Orleans\" (Longhair 1949). [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and \"fell under the spell of [[Perez Prado]]'s [[mambo (music)|mambo]] records.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\"/> Professor Longhair's particular style was known locally as ''rumba-boogie''.<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 298). \"Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music.\" ''Popular Music'', v. 19, n. 3. Oct. 2000), p.&nbsp;293\u2013318.</ref>\n\nOne of Longhair's great contributions was his particular approach of adopting two-celled, clave-based patterns into [[New Orleans rhythm and blues]] (R&B). Longhair's rhythmic approach became a basic template of funk. According to [[Dr. John]] (Malcolm John \"Mac\" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor \"put funk into music&nbsp;... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.\"<ref>Dr. John quoted by Stewart (2000: 297).</ref> In his \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\", the pianist employs the [[clave (rhythm)|2-3 clave]] onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba-boogie \"[[guajeo]]\".<ref>Kevin Moore: \"There are two common ways that the three-side [of clave] is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Pe\u00f1alosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm. By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Pe\u00f1alosa calls the 'offbeat/onbeat motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common.\" Moore (2011). ''Understanding Clave and Clave Changes'' p. 32. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. {{ISBN|1466462302}}</ref>\n\nThe syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swung]] subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Stewart states: \"Eventually, musicians from outside of New Orleans began to learn some of the rhythmic practices [of the Crescent City]. Most important of these were James Brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed. Brown's early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms, and some of his most successful songs were 12/8 ballads (e.g. 'Please, Please, Please' (1956), 'Bewildered' (1961), 'I Don't Mind' (1961)). Brown's change to a funkier brand of soul required 4/4 metre and a different style of drumming.\"<ref>Stewart (2000: 302).</ref> Stewart makes the point: \"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2000-293\">Stewart (2000: 293).</ref>\n\n=== 1960s: James Brown ===\n[[File:JamesBrown.jpg|thumb|right|James Brown, a progenitor of funk music]]\n[[Little Richard]]'s saxophone-studded, mid-1950s R&B road band was credited by James Brown and others as being the first to put the funk in the rock'n'roll beat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/little-richard|title=Little Richard|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref> Following his temporary exit from secular music to become an evangelist in 1957, some of Little Richard's band members joined Brown and [[the Famous Flames]], beginning a long string of hits for them in 1958. By the mid-1960s, [[James Brown]] had developed his signature groove that emphasized the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]\u2014with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]] that typified African-American music.<ref>[http://www.anisman.com/steve/samd02.htm Lessons in listening \u2013 Concepts section: Fantasy, Earth Wind & Fire, The Best of Earth Wind & Fire Volume I, Freddie White.] (January 1998).

Retrieved January 21, 2007.</ref> Brown often cued his band with the command \"On the one!,\" changing the percussion emphasis/accent from the one-'''''two'''''-three-'''''four''''' backbeat of traditional soul music to the '''''one'''''-two-three-four downbeat \u2013 but with an even-note [[Syncopation|syncopated]] guitar rhythm (on quarter notes two and four) featuring a hard-driving, repetitive brassy [[Swung note|swing]]. This one-three beat launched the shift in Brown's signature music style, starting with his 1964 hit single, \"[[Out of Sight (song)|Out of Sight]]\" and his 1965 hits, \"[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]\" and \"[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]\".\n\nBrown's style of funk was based on interlocking, contrapuntal parts: funky [[bass line]]s, drum patterns, and syncopated guitar riffs.<ref name=\"Slutsky, Allan 1997\"/> The main guitar ostinatos for \"Ain't it Funky\" (c. late 1960s) is an example of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk\u2014 an irresistibly danceable riff, stripped down to its rhythmic essence. On \"Ain't it Funky\" the tonal structure is barebones. Brown's innovations led to him and his band becoming the seminal funk act; they also pushed the funk music style further to the forefront with releases such as \"[[Cold Sweat]]\" (1967), \"[[Mother Popcorn]]\" (1969) and \"[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine]]\" (1970), discarding even the twelve-bar blues featured in his earlier music. Instead, Brown's music was overlaid with \"catchy, anthemic vocals\" based on \"extensive vamps\" in which he also used his voice as \"a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts and with rhythm-section patterns&nbsp;...

[[Dyke and the Blazers]], based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], released \"[[Funky Broadway]]\" in 1967, perhaps the first record of the [[soul music]] era to have \"funky\" in the title. In 1969 [[Jimmy McGriff]] released ''[[Electric Funk]]'', featuring his distinctive organ over a blazing horn section.  Meanwhile, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]] was releasing funk tracks beginning with its first album in 1967, culminating in the classic single \"Express Yourself\" in 1971. Also from the West Coast area, more specifically [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], San Francisco,<!-- say what? --> came the band [[Tower of Power]] (TOP), which formed in 1968. Their debut album ''[[East Bay Grease]]'', released 1970, is considered an important milestone in funk. Throughout the 1970s, TOP had many hits, and the band helped to make funk music a successful genre, with a broader audience.\n\nIn 1970, [[Sly & the Family Stone]]'s \"[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]\" reached #1 on the charts, as did \"[[Family Affair (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]\" in 1971.  Notably, these afforded the group and the genre crossover success and greater recognition, yet such success escaped comparatively talented and moderately popular funk band peers. [[The Meters]] defined funk in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], starting with their top ten R&B hits \"Sophisticated Cissy\" and \"[[Cissy Strut]]\" in 1969. Another group who defined funk around this time were [[the Isley Brothers]], whose funky 1969 #1 R&B hit, \"[[It's Your Thing]]\", signaled a breakthrough in African-American music, bridging the gaps of the jazzy sounds of Brown, the [[psychedelic rock]] of [[Jimi Hendrix]], and the upbeat soul of Sly & the Family Stone and [[Mother's Finest]]. [[The Temptations]], who had previously helped to define the \"[[Motown Sound]]\" \u2013 a distinct blend of pop-soul \u2013 adopted this new [[psychedelic soul|psychedelic]] sound towards the end of the 1960s as well. Their producer, [[Norman Whitfield]], became an innovator in the field of psychedelic soul, creating hits with a newer, funkier sound for many [[Motown]] acts, including \"[[War (Edwin Star song)|War]]\" by [[Edwin Starr]], \"[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]\" by [[the Undisputed Truth]] and \"[[Papa Was A Rollin' Stone]]\" by the Temptations. Motown producers [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]] (\"[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep On Truckin']]\") and [[Hal Davis]] (\"[[Dancing Machine]]\") followed suit. [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Marvin Gaye]] also adopted funk beats for some of their biggest hits in the 1970s, such as \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" and \"[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]\", and \"[[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|I Want You]]\" and \"[[Got To Give It Up]]\", respectively.\n\n=== P-Funk: Parliament-Funkadelic ===\n{{Main|P-Funk}}\n[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006]]\nA new group of musicians began to further develop the \"funk rock\" approach.  Innovations were prominently made by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], with his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]]. Together, they produced a new kind of funk sound heavily influenced by [[jazz]] and [[psychedelic rock]].  The two groups shared members and are often referred to collectively as \"Parliament-Funkadelic.\" The breakout popularity of Parliament-Funkadelic gave rise to the term \"[[P-Funk]]\", which referred to the music by George Clinton's bands, and defined a new subgenre. Clinton played a principal role in several other bands, including [[Parlet]], the Horny Horns, and the Brides of Funkenstein, all part of the P-Funk conglomerate. \"P-funk\" also came to mean something in its quintessence, of superior quality, or ''[[sui generis]]''.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n{{see also|Disco}}\n\n[[File:Stone3.jpg|thumb|[[The Original Family Stone]] live, 2006. Jerry Martini, Rose Stone, and Cynthia Robinson]]\n\nThe 1970s were the era of highest mainstream visibility for funk music. In addition to [[Parliament Funkadelic]], artists like [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Rufus & Chaka Khan]], the [[Isley Brothers]], [[Ohio Players]], [[Con Funk Shun]], [[Kool and the Gang]], [[the Bar-Kays]], [[Commodores]], [[Roy Ayers]], [[Stevie Wonder]], among others, were successful in getting radio play. [[Disco]] music owed a great deal to funk. Many early disco songs and performers came directly from funk-oriented backgrounds. Some disco music hits, such as all of [[Barry White]]'s hits, \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" by [[Biddu]] and [[Carl Douglas]], [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love To Love You Baby]]\", [[Diana Ross]]' \"[[Love Hangover]]\", [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]'s \"[[I'm Your Boogie Man]]\", \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\" by [[Chaka Khan]] (also known as the Queen of Funk Soul), and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s \"Le Freak\" conspicuously include riffs and rhythms derived from funk.  In 1976, [[Rose Royce]] scored a number-one hit with a purely dance-funk record, \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\". Even with the arrival of Disco, funk became increasingly popular well into the early '80s.\n\nFunk music was also exported to Africa, and it melded with African singing and rhythms to form [[Afrobeat]]. Nigerian musician [[Fela Kuti]], who was heavily influenced by James Brown's music, is credited with creating the style and terming it \"Afrobeat\".\n\n=== Jazz funk ===\n{{Main|Jazz-funk}}\n\n==== ''Headhunters'' ====\nIn the 1970s, at the same time that jazz musicians began to explore blending jazz with rock to create [[jazz fusion]], major jazz performers began to experiment with funk. Jazz-funk recordings typically used [[electric bass]] and [[electric piano]] in the rhythm section, in place of the double bass and acoustic piano that were typically used in jazz up till that point. Pianist and [[bandleader]] [[Herbie Hancock]] was the first of many big jazz artists who embraced funk during the decade. Hancock's [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]] band (1973) played the jazz-funk style. The Headhunters' lineup and instrumentation, retaining only [[Wind instrument|wind]] player [[Bennie Maupin]] from Hancock's previous sextet, reflected his new musical direction. He used percussionist [[Bill Summers (musician)|Bill Summers]] in addition to a drummer. Summers blended African, Afro-Cuban, and Afro-Brazilian instruments and rhythms into Hancock's jazzy funk sound.\n\n==== ''On the Corner'' ====\n''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972) was jazz trumpeter-composer [[Miles Davis]]'s seminal foray into jazz-funk. Like his previous works though, ''On the Corner'' was experimental. Davis stated that ''On the Corner'' was an attempt at reconnecting with the young [[African American|black]] audience which had largely forsaken jazz for [[rock and roll|rock]] and funk. While there is a discernible funk influence in the [[timbre]]s of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas, and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. From a musical standpoint, the album was a culmination of sorts of the [[sound recording|recording studio]]-based ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' approach that Davis and [[Record producer|producer]] [[Teo Macero]] (who had studied with [[Otto Luening]] at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Computer Music Center]]) had begun to explore in the late 1960s. Both sides of the record featured heavy funk drum and bass grooves, with the melodic parts snipped from hours of jams and mixed in the studio.\n\nAlso cited as musical influences on the album by Davis were the contemporary composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].<ref>\"Miles Davis first heard Stockhausen's music in 1972, and its impact can be felt in Davis's 1972 recording ''On the Corner'', in which cross-cultural elements are mixed with found elements.\" Barry Bergstein \"Miles Davis and Karlheinz Stockhausen: A Reciprocal Relationship.\" The Musical Quarterly 76, no. 4. (Winter): p. 503.</ref><ref>In Davis' autobiography he states that \"I had always written in a circular way and through Stockhausen I could see that I didn't want to ever play again from eight bars to eight bars, because I never end songs: they just keep going on. Through Stockhausen I understood music as a process of elimination and addition\" (''Miles'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1989, p. 329)</ref>\n\n=== 1980s and synthesizer funk ===\n{{see also|Electro music}}\n\nIn the 1980s, largely as a reaction against what was seen as the over-indulgence of [[disco]], many of the core elements that formed the foundation of the P-Funk formula began to be usurped by [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]], [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. Horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were replaced by [[Synthesizer|synth]] [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], and the horns that remained were given simplified lines, and few horn solos were given to soloists. The classic electric keyboards of funk, like the [[Hammond B3]] organ, the Hohner [[Clavinet]] and/or the [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes piano]] began to be replaced by the new [[digital synthesizer]]s such as the [[Yamaha DX7]]. Electronic [[drum machines]] such as the [[Roland TR-808]] began to replace the \"[[funky drummer]]s\" of the past, and the [[Slapping (music)|slap]] and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by synth keyboard bass lines. Lyrics of funk songs began to change from suggestive [[double entendre]]s to more graphic and sexually explicit content.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO) began experimenting with electronic funk music, introducing \"[[Video game music|videogame]]-funk\" sounds with hits such as \"[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game]]\" (1978), which had a strong influence on the later [[Electro music|electro-funk]] genre.<ref name=\"dayal_interview\">{{cite web|last=Dayal|first=Gheeta|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra|url=http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/blog/archives/00000615.htm|work=Groove|publisher=The Original Soundtrack|accessdate=June 17, 2011|date=July 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002224518/http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/blog/archives/00000615.htm|archive-date=October 2, 2011|dead-url=yes}}</ref> In 1980, YMO was the first band to use the TR-808 programmable drum machine,<ref name=\"cbc_808\">{{cite news|title=Slaves to the rhythm: Kanye West is the latest to pay tribute to a classic drum machine|date=November 28, 2008|author=Jason Anderson|publisher=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2008/11/27/f-history-of-the-808.html|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> while YMO member [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'s \"[[:File:Riot in Lagos.ogg|Riot in Lagos]]\" developed the beats and sounds of electro-funk that same year,<ref name=\"wire_1996\">{{citation|title=A-Z Of Electro|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=145|date=March 1996|author=David Toop|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> influencing later electro-funk artists such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]]<ref name=\"wire_1996\"/> and [[Mantronix]].<ref>{{citation|title=Kurtis Mantronik Interview |work=Hip Hop Storage |date=July 2002 |url=http://www.cheebadesign.com/legends/articleX.html |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524234641/http://www.cheebadesign.com/legends/articleX.html |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Rick James]] was the first funk musician of the 1980s to assume the funk mantle dominated by P-Funk in the 1970s. His 1981 album ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', with the singles \"Give It to Me Baby\" and \"[[Super Freak]]\", resulted in James becoming a star, and paved the way for the future direction of explicitness in funk.\n\n[[File:Prince by jimieye.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was an influential multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, singer and songwriter.]]\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used a stripped-down, dynamic instrumentation similar to James. However, Prince went on to have as much of an impact on the sound of funk as any one artist since Brown; he combined eroticism, technology, an increasing musical complexity, and an outrageous image and stage show to ultimately create music as ambitious and imaginative as P-Funk. Prince formed [[The Time (band)|the Time]], originally conceived as an opening act for him and based on his \"[[Minneapolis sound]]\", hybrid mixture of funk, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]] & [[New wave music|new wave]].  Eventually, the band went on to define their own style of stripped-down funk based on tight musicianship and sexual themes.\n\nSimilar to Prince, other bands emerged during the P-Funk era and began to incorporate uninhibited sexuality, dance-oriented themes, [[synthesizer]]s and other electronic technologies to continue to craft funk hits. These included [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], the [[Gap Band]], the [[Bar-Kays]], and the [[Dazz Band]] all found their biggest hits in the early 1980s. By the latter half of the 80s, pure funk had lost its commercial impact; however, pop artists from [[Michael Jackson]] to [[Duran Duran]] often used funk beats.\n\nInfluenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra<ref name=\"wire_1996\"/> and [[Kraftwerk]], the American musician [[Afrika Bambaataa]] developed electro-funk, a minimalist machine-driven style of funk with his single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" in 1982. Also known simply as electro, this style of funk was driven by synthesizers and the electronic rhythm of the [[TR-808]] drum machine. The single \"[[Renegades of Funk]]\" followed in 1983.\n\n=== Late 1980s to present ===\nWhile funk was all but driven from the radio by slick commercial [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B]] and [[new jack swing]], its influence continued to spread. Artists like Steve Arrington and Cameo still received major airplay and had huge global followings.  Rock bands began copying elements of funk to their sound, creating new combinations of \"[[funk rock]]\" and \"[[funk metal]]\". [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Living Colour]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Fishbone]], [[Faith No More]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Infectious Grooves]], and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] spread the approach and styles garnered from funk pioneers to new audiences in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s. These bands later inspired the underground mid-1990s funkcore movement and current funk-inspired artists like [[Outkast]], [[Malina Moye]], [[Van Hunt]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]].\n\nIn the 1990s, artists like [[Me'shell Ndegeocello]] and the (predominantly UK-based) [[acid jazz]] movement including artists and bands such as [[Jamiroquai]], [[Incognito (band)|Incognito]], [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Omar Lye-Fook|Omar]], [[Los Tetas]] and the [[Brand New Heavies]] carried on with strong elements of funk. However, they never came close to reaching the commercial success of funk in its heyday, with the exception of Jamiroquai whose album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' sold about 11.5 million units worldwide. Meanwhile, in Australia and New Zealand, bands playing the pub circuit, such as [[Supergroove]], [[Skunkhour]] and [[The Truth (Australian band)|the Truth]], preserved a more instrumental form of funk.\n\nSince the late 1980s [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists have regularly [[sampling (music)|sampled]] old funk tunes. [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] is said to be the most sampled artist in the history of hip hop, while [[P-Funk]] is the second most sampled artist; samples of old [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] songs formed the basis of [[West Coast rap|West Coast]] [[G-funk]].\n\nOriginal beats that feature funk-styled bass or rhythm guitar riffs are also not uncommon. [[Dr. Dre]] (considered the progenitor of the G-funk genre) has freely acknowledged to being heavily influenced by George Clinton's psychedelic funk: \"Back in the 70s that's all people were doing: getting high, wearing [[Afro]]s, bell-bottoms and listening to Parliament-Funkadelic. That's why I called my album ''[[The Chronic]]'' and based my music and the concepts like I did: because his shit was a big influence on my music. Very big\".<ref>[http://www.musicstrands.com/artist/6599/biography Dr. Dre > Biography at MyStrands<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220104429/http://www.musicstrands.com/artist/6599/biography |date=February 20, 2006 }}</ref> [[Digital Underground]] was a large contributor to the rebirth of funk in the 1990s by educating their listeners with knowledge about the history of funk and its artists. George Clinton branded Digital Underground as \"[[Sons of the P]]\", as their second full-length release is also titled. DU's first release, [[Sex Packets]], was full of funk samples, with the most widely known \"[[The Humpty Dance]]\" sampling Parliament's \"Let's Play House\". A very strong funk album of DU's was their 1996 release ''[[Future Rhythm]]''. Much of contemporary club dance music, drum and bass in particular has heavily sampled funk drum breaks.\n\nFunk is a major element of certain artists identified with the [[jam band]] scene of the late 1990s and 2000s. [[Phish]] began playing funkier jams in their sets around 1996, and 1998's ''[[The Story of the Ghost]]'' was heavily influenced by funk. [[Medeski Martin & Wood]], [[Robert Randolph & the Family Band]], [[Galactic]], Widespread Panic, [[Jam Underground]], Diazpora, [[Soulive]], and [[Karl Denson's Tiny Universe]] all drawing heavily from the funk tradition. [[Lettuce (band)|Lettuce]], a band of [[Berklee College Of Music]] graduates, was formed in the late 1990s as a pure-funk emergence was being felt through the jam band scene.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Many members of the band including keyboardist Neal Evans went on to other projects such as [[Soulive]] or the Sam Kininger Band. [[Dumpstaphunk]] builds upon the New Orleans tradition of funk, with their gritty, low-ended grooves and soulful four-part vocals. Formed in 2003 to perform at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], the band features keyboardist [[Ivan Neville]] and guitarist Ian Neville of the famous Neville family, with two bass players and female funk drummer Nikki Glaspie (formerly of [[Beyonc\u00e9|Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]]'s world touring band, as well as the Sam Kininger Band), who joined the group in 2011.\n\nSince the mid-1990s the [[nu-funk]] scene, centered on the [[Deep Funk]] collectors scene, is producing new material influenced by the sounds of rare funk 45s. Labels include Desco, Soul Fire, [[Daptone Records|Daptone]], Timmion, Neapolitan, Bananarama, Kay-Dee, and Tramp. These labels often release on 45&nbsp;rpm records. Although specializing in music for rare funk DJs, there has been some crossover into the mainstream music industry, such as Sharon Jones' 2005 appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.\n\nIn the early 2000s, some [[Dance-punk|punk funk]] bands such as [[Out Hud]] and Mongolian MonkFish perform in the [[indie rock]] scene. Indie band [[Rilo Kiley]], in keeping with their tendency to explore a variety of rockish styles, incorporated funk into their song \"[[The Moneymaker]]\" on the album ''[[Under the Blacklight]]''. Prince, with his later albums, gave a rebirth to the funk sound with songs like \"The Everlasting Now\", \"[[Musicology (song)|Musicology]]\", \"Ol' Skool Company\", and \"[[Black Sweat]]\".\n\nFunk has also been incorporated into [[Contemporary R&B|modern R&B]] music by many female singers such as [[Beyonc\u00e9]] with her 2003 hit \"[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Crazy in Love]]\" (which samples [[the Chi-Lites]]' \"Are You My Woman\"), [[Mariah Carey]] in 2005 with \"[[Get Your Number]]\" (which samples \"[[Just an Illusion]]\" by British band [[Imagination (band)|Imagination]]), [[Jennifer Lopez]] in 2005 with \"[[Get Right (Jennifer Lopez song)|Get Right]]\" (which samples [[Maceo Parker]]'s \"[[Soul Power '74]]\" horn sound), and also [[Amerie]] with her song \"[[1 Thing]]\" (which samples [[the Meters]]' \"Oh, Calcutta!\"). [[Tamar Braxton]] in 2013 with \"[[The One (Tamar Braxton song)|The One]]\" (which samples \"[[Juicy Fruit (song)|Juicy Fruit]]\" by [[Mtume]]).\n\n[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the \"Queen of Funk.\"]]\n\n=== Women and funk ===\nDespite funk's popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of [[Women in music|funk women]]. Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], [[Lyn Collins]], [[Betty Davis]] and [[Teena Marie]]. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay \"She Was Too Black for Rock and Too Hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis,\" most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that \"Betty Davis is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cheryl Keyes|title=\"She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis\"|date=2013|journal=American Studies|volume=52|page=35|url=https://journals.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/4476}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Feminist Funk Power of Betty Davis and Ren\u00e9e Stout'', Nikki A.

Furthermore, this affected the young artist's ability to draw large audiences and commercial success. Greene also notes that Davis was never made an official spokesperson or champion for the civil rights and feminist movements of the time, although more recently{{when|date=October 2018}} her work has become a symbol of sexual liberation for women of color. Davis' song \"If I'm In Luck I Just Might Get Pick Up\", on her self-titled debut album, sparked controversy and was banned by the Detroit [[NAACP]].{{dubious|reason=The NAACP has no power to ban anything.|date=October 2018}} Maureen Mahan, a musicologist and anthropologist, examines Davis' impact on the music industry and the American public in her article \"They Say She's Different: Race Gender, Genre and the Liberated Black Femininity of Betty Davis.\" Mahan notes that Davis \"took pleasure in her frank and public exploration of a black woman's sexual agency, but she did so in a context that offered limited opportunities for black female-centered expressions\" (24).{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nLaina Dawes, the author of ''What Are You Doing Here: A Black Woman's Life and Liberation in Heavy Metal'', believes [[respectability politics]] is the reason artists like Davis do not get the same recognition as their male counterparts: \"I blame what I call respectability politics as part of the reason the funk-rock some of the women from the '70s aren't better known.{{vq|date=October 2018}} <!-- The preceding sentence was clearly mangled. Should it read \"the reason some of the funk-rock women from the '70s\"? Should it say something else?

Royster, in [[Rickey Vincent]]'s book ''Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One'', he analyzes the impact of Labelle but only in limited sections. Royster criticizes Vincent's analysis of the group, stating: \"It is a shame, then, that Vincent gives such minimal attention to Labelle's performances in his study. This reflects, unfortunately, a still consistent sexism that shapes the evaluation of funk music. In ''Funk'', Vincent's analysis of Labelle is brief\u2014sharing a single paragraph with the Pointer Sisters in his three-page sub chapter, 'Funky Women.' He writes that while '[[Lady Marmalade]]' 'blew the lid off of the standards of sexual innuendo and skyrocketed the group's star status,' the band's 'glittery image slipped into the disco undertow and was ultimately wasted as the trio broke up in search of solo status' (Vincent, 1996, 192).'<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royster|first=Francesca T.|date=2013|title=Labelle: Funk, Feminism, and the Politics of Flight and Fight|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/ams.2013.0120|journal=American Studies|volume=52|issue=4|pages=77\u201398|doi=10.1353/ams.2013.0120|issn=2153-6856}}</ref> Many female artists who are considered to be in the genre of funk, also share songs in the [[disco]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] genres; Labelle falls into this category of women who are split among genres due to critical view of music theory and the history of sexism in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/08/01/on-the-difference-between-funk-and-disco/25fcc5c6-1a13-4d64-9e99-a67dbd004b9a/|title=On the Difference Between Funk and Disco|date=August 1, 1979|work=The Washington Post|access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years,{{when|date=October 2018}} artists like [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] have opened the doors for more scholarship and analysis on the female impact on the funk music genre.{{dubious|reason=Mon\u00e1e causes scholarship and analysis?

Inspired by singers such as [[Chuck Brown]], the \"Godfather of Go-go\", it is a blend of funk, [[rhythm and blues]], and early [[hip hop music|hip hop]], with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person [[jam band|jamming]] in place of [[Sampling (music)|dance tracks]].  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience [[call and response]].  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.\n\n=== Boogie ===\n{{Main|Boogie (genre)}}\nBoogie (or electro-funk) is an electronic music mainly influenced by funk and post-disco. The minimalist approach of boogie, consisting of synthesizers and keyboards, helped to establish electro and house music.  Boogie, unlike electro, emphasises the slapping techniques of bass guitar but also bass synthesizers. Artists include [[Vicky D|Vicky \"D\"]], [[Komiko]], [[Peech Boys]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and later [[Evelyn King (singer)|Evelyn King]].\n\n=== Electro funk ===\n{{Main|Electro funk}}\nElectro funk is a hybrid of electronic music and funk. It essentially follows the same form as funk, and retains funk's characteristics, but is made entirely (or partially) with a use of electronic instruments such as the [[TR-808]]. [[Vocoder]]s or [[talkbox]]es were commonly implemented to transform the vocals. The pioneering Electro band [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] commonly used such instruments in their music. Other artists include [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Egyptian Lover]], [[Vaughan Mason & Crew]], [[Midnight Star]] and [[Cybotron (American band)|Cybotron]].\n\n=== Funk metal ===\n{{Main|Funk metal}}\nFunk metal (sometimes typeset differently such as ''funk-metal'') is a [[fusion genre]] of [[music]] which emerged in the 1980s, as part of the [[alternative metal]] movement. It typically incorporates elements of funk and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (often [[thrash metal]]), and in some cases other styles, such as [[hardcore punk|punk]] and [[experimental rock|experimental]] music. It features hard-driving heavy metal [[guitar]] riffs, the pounding [[bass guitar|bass]] rhythms characteristic of funk, and sometimes [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-style [[rhyme]]s into an [[alternative rock]] approach to songwriting. A primary example is the all-African-American rock band [[Living Colour]], who have been said to be \"funk-metal pioneers\" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fricke|first=David|title=Living Colour \u2013 Collideoscope|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/livingcolour/albums/album/290616/review/6209668/collideoscope|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=December 11, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412062112/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/livingcolour/albums/album/290616/review/6209668/collideoscope|archivedate=April 12, 2009|date=November 13, 2003|quote=Black-funk-metal pioneers return in righteous form when black-rock warriors Living Colour broke up in 1995,}}</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the style was most prevalent in [[California]] \u2013 particularly [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Primus: Nice and Cheesy |journal=Hot Metal |location=Sydney, Australia |last=Potter |first=Valerie |date=July 1991 |volume=29}}</ref><ref name=\"Spin Jan 91\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9fMwxwJ7tkC&pg=PA39 |page=39 |title=The Thrash-Funk scene proudly presents Primus |last=Darzin |first=Daina |last2=Spencer |first2=Lauren |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=January 1991 |volume=6 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== G-funk ===\n{{Main|G-funk}}\nG-funk is a [[fusion genre]] of music which combines [[gangsta rap]] and funk. It is generally considered to have been invented by west coast rappers and made famous by [[Dr. Dre]]. It incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as [[EPMD]] and [[the Bomb Squad]]), G-funk often used fewer, unaltered samples per song.\n\n=== Timba funk ===\n{{Main|Timba}}\n[[Timba]] is a form of funky Cuban popular dance music. By 1990, several Cuban bands had incorporated elements of funk and hip-hop into their arrangements, and expanded upon the instrumentation of the traditional conjunto with American drum set, saxophones and a two-keyboard format. Timba bands like La Charanga Habanera or Bamboleo often have horns or other instruments playing short parts of tunes by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Kool and the Gang]] or other U.S. funk bands.  While many funk motifs exhibit a [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]-based structure, they are created intuitively, without a conscious intent of aligning the various parts to a [[bell pattern|guide-pattern]]. Timba incorporates funk motifs into an overt and intentional clave structure.\n\n=== Funk jam ===\nFunk jam is a [[fusion genre]] of music which emerged in the 1990s. It typically incorporates elements of funk and often exploratory guitar, along with extended cross genre improvisations; often including elements of [[jazz]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] including improvised lyrics. [[Phish]], [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]], [[Galactic]], [[Soulive]] are all examples of funk bands that play funk jam.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|R&B and Soul Music|African-American}}\n* [[Chanking]]\n* [[List of funk musicians]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Vincent | first = Rickey\n | title=Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One\n | year=1996\n | publisher=St. Martin's Press\n | isbn=0-312-13499-1\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Thompson | first = Dave\n | title=Funk | year=2001\n | publisher=Backbeat Books\n | isbn=0-87930-629-7\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Wermelinger | first = Peter\n | title=Funky & Groovy Music Records Lexicon | year=2005\n | publisher=-\n | isbn=3-9522773-1-2\n }}\n\n{{Funkmusic}}\n{{Rhythm and blues}}\n{{Music industry}}\n\n[[Category:Funk| ]]\n[[Category:African-American culture]]\n[[Category:African-American music]]\n[[Category:African-American history]]\n[[Category:American styles of music]]\n[[Category:Popular music]]\n[[Category:1960s in music]]\n[[Category:1970s in music]]", "sha1": "eugo7kg42u4u9bupr51s260z6mrc3lg"}}, {"title": "Frequency", "ns": "0", "id": "10779", "revision": {"id": "864556886", "parentid": "864556881", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T00:26:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/2601:192:8800:CA90:6496:6E14:EA01:2A05|2601:192:8800:CA90:6496:6E14:EA01:2A05]] to version by JackintheBox.

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]] disciplines, such as [[optics]], [[acoustics]], and [[radio]], frequency is usually denoted by a Latin letter ''f'' or by the Greek letter ''<math>\\nu</math>'' or [[Nu (letter)|''\u03bd'' (nu)]] (see e.g. [[Planck constant|Planck's formula]]).\n\nThe relation between the frequency and the period <math>T</math> of a repeating event or oscillation is given by\n:<math>f = \\frac{1}{T}.</math>\n\n== Units ==\nThe [[SI derived unit]] of frequency is the [[hertz]] (Hz), named after the German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]]. One hertz means that an event repeats once per [[second]]. A previous name for this unit was [[Cycle per second|cycles per second]] (cps). The [[SI]] unit for period is the second.\n\nA traditional unit of measure used with rotating mechanical devices is [[revolutions per minute]], abbreviated r/min or rpm. 60&nbsp;rpm equals one hertz.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Davies\n  | first = A.\n  | authorlink =\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = New York\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-412-61320-3\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=j2mN2aIs2YIC&pg=RA1-PA275\n  | title = Handbook of Condition Monitoring: Techniques and Methodology}}</ref>\n\n== Period versus frequency ==\nAs a matter of convenience, longer and slower waves, such as [[ocean surface wave]]s, tend to be described by wave period rather than frequency.

Angular frequency (in radians) is larger than regular frequency (in Hz) by a factor of 2\u03c0.\n\n* [[Spatial frequency]] is analogous to temporal frequency, but the time axis is replaced by one or more spatial displacement axes. E.g.:\n\n::<math>y(t) = \\sin\\left( \\theta(t,x) \\right) = \\sin(\\omega t + kx)</math>\n\n::<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\mathrm{d} x} = k</math>\n\n: [[Wavenumber]], ''k'', is the spatial frequency analogue of angular temporal frequency and is measured in radians per [[meter (unit)|meter]]. In the case of more than one spatial dimension, wavenumber is a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] quantity.\n\n== In wave propagation {{anchor|Frequency of waves}} ==\n{{further|Wave propagation}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Hearing impairment]] -->\nFor periodic waves in [[Dispersion relation|nondispersive media]] (that is, media in which the wave speed is independent of frequency), frequency has an inverse relationship to the [[wavelength]], ''\u03bb'' ([[lambda]]). Even in dispersive media, the frequency ''f'' of a sinusoidal wave is equal to the [[phase velocity]] ''v'' of the [[wave]] [[division (mathematics)|divided]] by the wavelength ''\u03bb'' of the wave:\n:<math>\nf = \\frac{v}{\\lambda}.\n</math>\n\nIn the [[special case]] of electromagnetic waves moving through a [[vacuum]], then ''v = c'', where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, and this expression becomes:\n:<math>\nf = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}.\n</math>\n\nWhen [[wave]]s from a [[monochrome]] source travel from one [[medium (optics)|medium]] to another, their frequency remains the same\u2014only their [[wavelength]] and [[phase speed|speed]] change.\n\n== Measurement ==\n{{see also|Frequency meter}}\n\nMeasurement of frequency can done in the following ways,\n\n=== Counting ===\nCalculating the frequency of a repeating event is accomplished by counting the number of times that event occurs within a specific time period, then dividing the count by the length of the time period. For example, if 71 events occur within 15 seconds the frequency is:\n:<math>f = \\frac{71}{15 \\,\\text{s}} \\approx 4.73 \\, \\text{Hz}</math>\nIf the number of counts is not very large, it is more accurate to measure the time interval for a predetermined number of occurrences, rather than the number of occurrences within a specified time.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Bakshi| first = K.A. |author2=A.V.

This is called ''gating error'' and causes an average error in the calculated frequency of <math>\\Delta f=\\frac{1}{2T_m}</math>, or a fractional error of <math>\\frac{\\Delta f}{f}=\\frac{1}{2fT_m}</math> where <math>T_m</math> is the timing interval and <math>f</math> is the measured frequency. This error decreases with frequency, so it is generally a problem at low frequencies where the number of counts '''''N''''' is small.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header   = \n| image1   = Resonant reed frequency meter.jpg\n| caption1 = \n| image2   = Czestosciomierz-49.9Hz.jpg\n| caption2 = \n| width    = 300\n| footer   = A resonant-reed frequency meter, an obsolete device used from about 1900 to the 1940s for measuring the frequency of alternating current.  It consists of a strip of metal with reeds of graduated lengths, vibrated by an [[electromagnet]].  When the unknown frequency is applied to the electromagnet, the reed which is [[resonance|resonant]] at that frequency will vibrate with large amplitude, visible next to the scale.\n}}\n\n=== Stroboscope ===\nAn older method of measuring the frequency of rotating or vibrating objects is to use a [[stroboscope]]. This is an intense repetitively flashing light ([[strobe light]]) whose frequency can be adjusted with a calibrated timing circuit. The strobe light is pointed at the rotating object and the frequency adjusted up and down. When the frequency of the strobe equals the frequency of the rotating or vibrating object, the object completes one cycle of oscillation and returns to its original position between the flashes of light, so when illuminated by the strobe the object appears stationary. Then the frequency can be read from the calibrated readout on the stroboscope. A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integral multiple of the strobing frequency will also appear stationary.\n\n=== Frequency counter ===\n{{main|Frequency counter}}\n[[File:Frequency counter.jpg|thumb|left|Modern frequency counter]]\n\nHigher frequencies are usually measured with a [[frequency counter]]. This is an [[electronic instrumentation|electronic instrument]] which measures the frequency of an applied repetitive electronic [[signal (electronics)|signal]] and displays the result in hertz on a [[digital display]]. It uses [[digital logic]] to count the number of cycles during a time interval established by a precision [[quartz clock|quartz]] time base. Cyclic processes that are not electrical in nature, such as the rotation rate of a shaft, mechanical vibrations, or [[sound wave]]s, can be converted to a repetitive electronic signal by [[transducer]]s and the signal applied to a frequency counter. Frequency counters can currently cover the range up to about 100&nbsp;GHz. This represents the limit of direct counting methods; frequencies above this must be measured by indirect methods.\n\n=== Heterodyne methods ===\nAbove the range of frequency counters, frequencies of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly by means of [[heterodyning]] ([[frequency changer|frequency conversion]]). A reference signal of a known frequency near the unknown frequency is mixed with the unknown frequency in a nonlinear mixing device such as a [[diode]]. This creates a [[heterodyne]] or \"beat\" signal at the difference between the two frequencies.  If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter. This process only measures the difference between the unknown frequency and the reference frequency. To reach higher frequencies, several stages of heterodyning can be used. Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies ([[optical heterodyne detection]]).\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Light ===\n{{main article|Light|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n<!--Linked from [[Neil Harbisson]]-->\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|Complete spectrum of [[electromagnetic radiation]] with the visible portion highlighted]]\n\nVisible light is an [[electromagnetic wave]], consisting of oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s traveling through space. The frequency of the wave determines its color: {{val|4|e=14|ul=Hz}} is red light, {{val|8|e=14|u=Hz}} is violet light, and between these (in the range 4-{{val|8|e=14|u=Hz}}) are all the other colors of the [[visible spectrum]]. An electromagnetic wave can have a frequency less than {{val|4|e=14|u=Hz}}, but it will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called [[infrared]] (IR) radiation. At even lower frequency, the wave is called a [[microwave]], and at still lower frequencies it is called a [[radio wave]]. Likewise, an electromagnetic wave can have a frequency higher than {{val|8|e=14|u=Hz}}, but it will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation. Even higher-frequency waves are called [[X-ray]]s, and higher still are [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nAll of these waves, from the lowest-frequency radio waves to the highest-frequency gamma rays, are fundamentally the same, and they are all called [[electromagnetic radiation]]. They all travel through a vacuum at the same speed (the [[speed of light]]), giving them [[wavelength]]s inversely proportional to their frequencies.\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle c=f\\lambda</math>\n\nwhere ''c'' is the speed of light (''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum, or less in other media), ''f'' is the frequency and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nIn [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive media]], such as glass, the speed depends somewhat on frequency, so the wavelength is not quite inversely proportional to frequency.\n\n=== Sound ===\n{{main article|Audio frequency}}\n[[File:Ultrasound range diagram.svg|thumb|425px|right|The [[sound wave]] spectrum, with rough guide of some applications]]\n\n[[Sound]] propagates as mechanical vibration waves of pressure and displacement, in air or other substances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sound|title=Definition of SOUND|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>.

The [[audible frequency]] range for humans is typically given as being between about 20&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz (20&nbsp;kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other [[species]] have different hearing ranges.

According to the [[Film Arts Foundation]] in San Francisco, \"''The Chris Awards'' (is) one of the most prestigious documentary, educational, business and informational competitions in the U.S; (it is) the oldest of its kind in North America and celebrating its 54th year.\" It was followed four years later by the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], held in March 1957, which emphasized feature-length dramatic films. The festival played a major role in introducing foreign films to American audiences. Films in the first year included [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' and [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]''.\n\nToday, thousands of film festivals take place around the world\u2014from high-profile festivals such as [[Sundance Film Festival]] and [[Slamdance Film Festival]] ([[Park City, Utah]]), to horror festivals such as Terror Film Festival ([[Philadelphia]]), and the Park City Film Music Festival, the first U.S. film festival dedicated to honoring music in film.\n\nFilm Funding competitions such as Writers and Filmmakers were introduced when the cost of production could be lowered significantly and internet technology allowed for the collaboration of film production.\n\n== Festival administration ==\n\n=== Business model ===\nAlthough there are notable for-profit festivals such as [[South by Southwest|SXSW]], most festivals operate on a nonprofit membership-based model, with a combination of ticket sales, membership fees, and corporate sponsorship constituting the majority of revenue. Unlike other arts nonprofits (performing arts, museums, etc.), film festivals typically receive few donations from the general public and are occasionally organized as nonprofit business associations instead of public charities. Film industry members often have significant curatorial input, and corporate sponsors are given opportunities to promote their brand to festival audiences in exchange for cash contributions. Private parties, often to raise investments for film projects, constitute significant \"fringe\" events. Larger festivals maintain year-round staffs often engaging in community and charitable projects outside festival season.\n\n=== Entry fee ===\nWhile entries from established filmmakers are usually considered pluses by the organizers, most festivals require new or relatively unknown filmmakers to pay an entry fee to have their works considered for screening. This is especially so in larger film festivals, such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Sundance Film Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], [[Montreal World Film Festival]], and even smaller \"boutique\" festivals such as the [[Miami International Film Festival]], [[British Urban Film Festival]] in London and [[Mumbai Women's International Film Festival]] in India.\n\nOn the other hand, some festivals\u2014usually those accepting fewer films, and perhaps not attracting as many \"big names\" in their audiences as do [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] and [[Telluride Film Festival|Telluride]]\u2014require no entry fee. [[Rotterdam Film Festival]], [[Mumbai]] Film Festival, and many smaller film festivals in the United States (the [[Stony Brook Film Festival]] on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], the [[Northwest Filmmakers' Festival]], and the Sicilian Film Festival in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]), are examples.\n \nThe [[Portland International Film Festival]] charges an entry fee, but waives it for filmmakers from the [[Northwestern United States]], and some others with regional focuses have similar approaches.\n\nSeveral film festival submission portal websites exist to streamline filmmakers' entries into multiple festivals. They provide databases of festival calls for entry and offer filmmakers a convenient \"describe once, submit many\" service.\n\n=== Screening out of competition ===\nThe core tradition of film festivals is competition, that is, the consideration of films with the intention of judging which are most deserving of various forms of recognition. In contrast to those films, some festivals may screen (i.e., [[projector|project]] onto a [[Projection screen|movie screen]] before an audience) some films without treating them as part of the competition; the films are said to be \"screened out...\" (or \"outside...\") \"of competition\".\n\n== Notable festivals ==\n\n[[File:AIRSCREEN inflatable screen USA.JPG|thumb|right|[[Traverse City Film Festival]] and their giant [[inflatable movie screen]]]]\nThe three most prestigious film festivals are generally considered to be [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], and [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Global Studies|editors=Anheier, Helmut K. and Mark Juergensmeyer|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|year=2012|isbn=9781412994224|page=566|quote=Cannes, Venice, and Berlin\u2014still hold the most prestigious status as cultural institutions that officially endorse the aesthetic and cinematic values of movies and critical currencies of film directors.}}</ref> These festivals are sometimes called the \"Big Three.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Figures Traced in Light: On Cinematic Staging|author=[[David Bordwell|Bordwell, David]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2005|isbn=9780520241978|page=144|quote=Because reputations were made principally on the festival circuit, the filmmaker had to find international financing and distribution and settle for minor festivals before arriving at one of the Big Three (Berlin, Cannes, Venice).}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Film Festivals: Culture, People, and Power on the Global Screen|last=Wong|first=Cindy Hing-Yuk|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|page=5|year=2011|isbn=9780813551104|quote=Whether we talk about the Big Three festivals\u2014Cannes, Venice, Berlin\u2014look at Sundance, Tribeca, and Toronto in North America, or examine other significant world festivals in Hong Kong, Pusan, Locarno, Rotterdam, San Sebasti\u00e1n, and Mar del Plata, the insistent global icons of all festivals are films, discoveries, auteurs, stars, parties, and awards.}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=The Foreign Film Renaissance on American Screens, 1946\u20131973|last=Balio|first=Tino|page=250|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]]|isbn=9780299247935|year=2010|quote=Unlike the big three international film festivals\u2014Cannes, Venice, and Berlin\u2014the New York Film Festival, like its London model, would be noncompetitive.}}</ref> Polish director [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]'s ''[[The Three Colors Trilogy]]'' were each made for these festivals, with ''[[Three Colors: Blue|Blue]]'' for Venice, ''[[Three Colors: White|White]]'' for Berlin, and ''[[Three Colors: Red|Red]]'' for Cannes.<ref name=dearcinema>{{cite web|url=http://dearcinema.com/international-film-festivals-and-india |title=International film festivals and India |publisher=[[DearCinema.com]] |author=Jugu Abraham |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121120848/http://dearcinema.com/article/international-film-festivals-and-india/0728 |archivedate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is North America's most popular festival.

There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re into a worldwide success.\n\nSoon film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry.\n\nThe earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long and without recorded sound.\n\nDuring the 1890s films became several minutes long and started to consist of several shots. The first film studios were built in 1897. The first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built in 1898. Special effects were introduced and film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, began to be used.\n\nIn the 1900s, continuity of action across successive shots was achieved and the first close-up shot was introduced (some claim [[D. W. Griffith]] was the inventor). Most films of this period were what came to be called \"chase films\". The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was \"The Nickelodeon\" in Pittsburgh in 1905. The first feature length multi-reel film was a 1906 Australian production. By 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, opening the way for the creation of film stars. Regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news. From about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in Australia and in all European countries except France.\n\nNew film techniques were introduced in this period including the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes. As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel and be easier to be understood by the audience{{snd}} an audience that was new to this form of storytelling. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama but these categories were further subdivided. During the [[First World War]] there was a complex transition for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programs to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices. By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another.\n\n[[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing among American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. The American film industry, or \"[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]\", as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries. By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,<ref name=\"filmsite.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html|title=Film History of the 1920s|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997).  During late 1927, Warner's released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', with the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Sound saved the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995).\n\nThe desire for wartime propaganda created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas. The onset of American involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. During the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by [[television]] and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The 1950s was considered a \"Golden Age\" for non-English [[world cinema|cinema]].\n\n''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'' is an 1888 [[short film|short]] [[silent film]] recorded by French inventor [[Louis Le Prince]].

Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include:\n* [[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]], probably used since prehistoric times\n* [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times\n* [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]], possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China\n* [[magic lantern]], developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s\n* [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] \"[[persistence of vision]]\" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868)\n\nSome ancient sightings of gods and spirits may have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or unknown projectors. By the 16th century [[necromancy|necromantic]] ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan \"magicians\" and \"witches\" seemed commonplace.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|last=Ruffles|first=Tom|pages=15\u201317}}</ref> The very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures. Around 1790 this was developed into multi-media ghost shows known as [[phantasmagoria]] that could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, [[superimposition]], [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. Similar spooky subject matter would form the basis of the [[horror film]] genre that emerged soon after the introduction of cinema.\n\nMoving images were possibly projected with the magic lantern since its invention; [[Christiaan Huygens]]' 1659 sketches for slides show a skeleton taking his skull off his neck and placing it back. Techniques to add motion to the painted glass slides were described since circa 1700. These usually involved parts (for instance limbs) painted on one or more extra pieces of glass, moved by hand or small mechanisms across a stationary slide which showed the rest of the picture.<ref name=Rossell2005>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/341263/The_Magic_Lantern_and_Moving_Images_before_1800|first=Deac|last=Rossell|title=The Magic Lantern and Moving Images before 1800|year=2005}}</ref> While the first magic lantern images seem to have been intended to scare audiences, soon all sorts of subjects appeared and the lantern was not only used for storytelling but also for education. In the 19th century several new and popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, etc.) or that showed for instance falling snow, or the planets and their moons revolving.\n\n==Early period==\n{{Main|Silent film|Sound film}}\n[[File:Kinetoscope.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interior view of [[Kinetoscope]] with peephole viewer at top of cabinet.]]\nIn the 1890s, films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or [[slapstick]]. There was little to no cinematic technique, the film was usually black and white and it was without sound.\n\n[[File:Fratelli_Lumiere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re]]\nThe novelty of realistic moving photographs was enough for a motion picture industry to blossom before the end of the century, in countries around the world. \"The Cinema\" was to offer a cheaper, simpler way of providing entertainment to the masses. Filmmakers could record actors' performances, which then could be shown to audiences around the world. Travelogues would bring the sights of far-flung places, with movement, directly to spectators' hometowns. Movies would become the most popular visual art form of the late Victorian age.<ref>Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. (2003) ''Film History An Introduction''. New York: McGraw-Hill Company Inc.p.13</ref>\n\nThe [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Berlin Wintergarten theater]] hosted an early movie presentation in front of an audience, shown by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in 1895. The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] started to screen movies in 1896. [[Movie theater]]s became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century, much like [[cabaret]]s and other theaters.\n\n[[File:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]].]]\nUntil 1927, motion pictures were produced without sound. This era is referred to as the [[Silent film|silent era of film]]. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film, thus dispensing with narrators, but in Japanese cinema human narration remained popular throughout the silent era. The technical problems were resolved by 1923.\n\n[[Illustrated song]]s were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in [[vaudeville]] houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters.<ref name=\"The House of Witmark\">{{Cite book|title=The House of Witmark| last=Witmark| first=Isidore|author2=Goldberg, Isaac| year=1939| page=116| publisher=New York OOO| location=New York| id=ASIN B001DZ8MP6|isbn=0-306-70686-5}}</ref> Live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass [[Magic lantern (projector)|slides]] projected through [[stereopticon]]s and similar devices. In this way, song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development. The main purpose of illustrated songs was to encourage [[sheet music]] sales, and they were highly successful with sales reaching into the millions for a single song. Later, with the birth of film, illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during [[Film reel|reel changes]].<ref name=\"The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14\">{{Cite book| last=Abel| first=Richard| chapter=That Most American of Attractions, The Illustrated Song| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wADgG_d-PSAC&pg=PA143| title=The Sounds of Early Cinema| editor1-last=Abel| editor1-first=Richard| editor2-first=Rick| editor2-last=Altman| year=2001| pages=143\u2013153| publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=0-253-33988-X}}</ref>\n\nThe 1914 ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' was a non-commercial attempt to combine the motion picture with a combination of slides and synchronize the resulting moving picture with audio. The film included hand-painted slides as well as other previously used techniques. Simultaneously playing the audio while the film was being played with a projector was required. Produced by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] (Jehovah's Witnesses), this eight\u2013hour bible drama was being shown in 80 cities every day and almost eight million people in the United States and Canada saw the presentation.<ref>''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics'' {{ISBN|978-1-438-13020-0}} p. 22</ref>\n\n== Birth of movies ==\nWithin eleven years of motion pictures, the films moved from a novelty show to an established large-scale entertainment industry. Films moved from a single shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions.\n\nBy 1900, the first motion pictures that can be considered as \"films\"{{snd}} emerged, and film-makers began to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wichm.home.xs4all.nl/myth.html|title=The genesis of cinematography distinguishes two dates: in 1888 the technology became available and from 1900 onwards film language developed.|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Invention and advancement of the camera ===\n[[Image:Melstud2.gif|thumb|200px|[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio.]]\nEarly movie cameras were fastened to the head of a tripod with only simple levelling devices provided. These cameras were effectively fixed during the course of a shot, and the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] shot a scene from the back of a train in 1896.\n\nThe first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built by [[Robert W. Paul]] in 1897, on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]]. He used his camera to shoot the procession in one shot. His device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a \"panning\" head were also referred to as 'panoramas' in the film catalogues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/robert-w-paul-cinematograph-camera-30th-birthday-countdown/|title=The cine camera which began the National Cinematography Collection|publisher=National Media Museum}}</ref>\n\n[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] built one of the first film studios in May 1897. It had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct rays of the sun on sunny days.<ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 747\u2013765.</ref> Beginning in 1896, M\u00e9li\u00e8s would go on to produce, direct, and distribute over 500 short films. The majority of these films were short, one-shot films completed in one take. M\u00e9li\u00e8s drew many comparisons between film and the stage, which was apparent in his work. He realized that film afforded him the ability (via his use of time lapse photography) to \"produce visual spectacles not achievable in the theater.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\">Gazetas, Aristides. ''An Introduction to World Cinema''. Jefferson: McFarland Company, Inc, 2000. Print.</ref>\n\n''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]'', produced by the Edison Company for viewing with the [[Kinetoscope]], showed [[Mary Queen of Scots]] being executed in full view of the camera. The effect was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|title=The execution of Mary Stuart 1895}}</ref> Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s also utilized this technique in the making of ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)''. The woman is seen to vanish through the use of [[stop motion]] techniques.\n\n[[Image:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|200px|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a \"dream vision\" in ''Santa Claus'' (1899).]]\nThe other basic technique for trick cinematography was the [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera. This was pioneered by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in England. The set was draped in black, and after the main shot, the negative was re-exposed to the overlaid scene. His ''The Corsican Brothers'' was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]] in 1900: \"By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow.\u201d\n\nG.A. Smith also initiated the special effects technique of [[reverse motion]]. He did this by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/725468/|title=Santa Claus (1898)|publisher=BFI Screenonline}}</ref> The first films made using this device were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter''. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''[[The House That Jack Built (1900 film)|The House That Jack Built]]'', made before September 1900.\n\n[[Cecil Hepworth]] took this technique further, by printing the [[negative (photography)|negative]] of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a \"projection printer\", and eventually an \"[[optical printer]]\".\n\nThe use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of [[Robert W. Paul]] and Hepworth. Paul shot scenes from ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899) with the camera turning very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder|Seidlitz Powder]]'' (1901). The Chief's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second. This gives what we would call a \"[[slow motion]]\" effect.\n\n=== Film editing and continuous narrative ===\nThe first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century, a notable example was the French film of the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], ''La vie du Christ (The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ)'',<ref>{{Citation|last=Guy|first=Alice|title=The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ|date=January 1907|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139714/|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref> by [[Alice Guy]]. These weren't represented as a continuous film, the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides, a lecture, and live choral numbers, to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes. Another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war]], made by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] in 1897. Although each scene was sold separately, they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors. Even M\u00e9li\u00e8s' ''Cendrillon (Cinderella)'' of 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one. To understand what was going on in the film the audience had to know their stories beforehand, or be told them by a presenter.\n\n[[File:Paul3.gif|thumb|center|600px|The two scenes making up ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'']]\nReal film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.<ref name=\"BFIso01\">{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref> In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. This technique was first used in his 1901 film ''[[Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost]]''.\n\nThe further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899 at the [[Brighton]] School in [[England]]. In the latter part of that year, [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] made ''The Kiss in the Tunnel''. This started with a shot from a \"phantom ride\" at the point at which the train goes into a tunnel, and continued with the action on a set representing the interior of a railway carriage, where a man steals a kiss from a woman, and then cuts back to the phantom ride shot when the train comes out of the tunnel. A month later, the Bamforth company in Yorkshire made a restaged version of this film under the same title, and in this case they filmed shots of a train entering and leaving a tunnel from beside the tracks, which they joined before and after their version of the kiss inside the train compartment.\n\n[[File:Telesc4.gif|thumb|center|600px|The first two shots of ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' (1900), with the telescope POV simulated by the circular mask.]]\nIn 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]], who also worked in [[Brighton]]. In that year Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'' (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the [[balcony]], who come and rescue them. The film also used the first \"reverse angle\" cut in film history.\n\nG.A Smith pioneered the use of the close-up shot in his 1900 films ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' and ''[[Grandma's Reading Glass]]''. He further developed the ideas of breaking a scene shot in one place into a series of shots taken from different camera positions over the next couple of years, starting with ''The Little Doctors'' of 1901. In a series of films he produced at this time, he also introduced the use of subjective and objective point-of-view shots, the creation of dream-time and the use of reversing. He summed up his work in ''Mary Jane's Mishap'' of 1903, with repeated cuts in to a close shot of a housemaid fooling around, along with superimpositions and other devices, before abandoning film-making to invent the Kinemacolor system of colour cinematography. His films were the first to establish the basics of coherent narrative and what became known as film language, or \"[[film grammar]]\".<ref name=\"BFIso001\">{{cite web |title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444530/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"BF01\">{{cite web|title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=David |last=Fisher |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |accessdate=2011-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002732/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nJames Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two film makers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552 \n |title=The Brighton School \n |accessdate=2012-12-17 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113027/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552 \n |archivedate=2013-12-24 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nMost films of this period were what came to be called \"chase films\". These were inspired by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''[[Stop Thief!]]'' of 1901, which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butcher's boy in the first shot, then being chased through the second shot by the butcher's boy and assorted dogs, and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot. Several British films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction. These included ''An Elopement \u00e0 la Mode'' and ''The Pickpocket: A Chase Through London'', made by Alf Collins for the British branch of the French [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont company]], ''Daring Daylight Burglary'', made by [[Frank Mottershaw]] at the Sheffield Photographic Company, and ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'', made by [[William Haggar]]. Haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots; the [[poaching|poachers]] are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along, creating a sense of urgency and speed.<ref name=\"Affray\">{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444205/ | title=Desperate Poaching Affray (1903) | work=[[British Film Institute]] | author= | accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> His films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges, while film academic [[No\u00ebl Burch]] praised Haggar's effective use of off-screen space.<ref name=\"BFI\">Hayes, Christian.

Accessed 30 August 2011.</ref> He was also one of the first film makers to purposefully introduce violence for entertainment; in ''Desperate Poaching Affray'' the villains are seen firing guns at their pursuers.\n\n[[Image:The Great Train Robbery 0018.jpg|thumb|left|Still from ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', produced by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]].]]\nOther filmmakers took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter, a projectionist, was hired by Thomas Edison to develop his new projection model known as the [[Vitascope]]. Porter wanted to develop a style of filmmaking that would move away from the one-shot short films into a \"story-telling [narrative]\" style.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\"/> When he began making longer films in 1902, he put a dissolve between every shot, just as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] [[film editing|editing]] method to show simultaneous action in different places. The time continuity in ''The Great Train Robbery'' was actually more confusing than that in the films it was modeled on, but nevertheless it was a greater success than them due to its [[American Old West|Wild West]] violence. ''The Great Train Robbery'' served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\"/>\n\nThe Path\u00e9 company in France also made imitations and variations of Smith and Williamson's films from 1902 onwards using cuts between the shots, which helped to standardize the basics of film construction. An influential French film of the period was M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 14-minute-long ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.<ref name=Hammond>{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Marvellous M\u00e9li\u00e8s|year=1974|publisher=Gordon Fraser|location=London|isbn=0900406380|page=141}}</ref> It was extremely popular at the time of its release, and is the best-known of the hundreds of films made by M\u00e9li\u00e8s. It was one of the first known [[science fiction film]]s, and used innovative [[animation]] and [[special effects]], including the well-known image of the spaceship landing in the Moon's eye. The sheer volume of Path\u00e9's production led to their filmmakers giving a further precision and polish to the details of film continuity.\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe first use of animation in movies was in 1899, with the production of the short film Matches: An Appeal by British film pioneer [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]]- a thirty-second long stop-motion animated piece intended to encourage the audience to send matches to British troops fighting the [[Boer War]]. The film contains an appeal to send money to [[Bryant and May]] who would then send matches to the troops fighting in South Africa. It was shown in December 1899 at The Empire Theatre in London. This film is the earliest known example of stop-motion animation. Little puppets, constructed of matchsticks, are writing the appeal on a black wall. Their movements are filmed frame by frame, movement by movement.\n\n[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A single frame from the ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' animation, showing the use of [[cutout animation|cut-out]] technique]]\nThe relative sophistication of this piece was not followed up for some time, with subsequent works in animation being limited to short, two or three frame effects, such as appeared in [[Edwin Stanton Porter]]'s 1902 short ''Fun in a Bakery Shop'', where a lump of dough was made to smile over the course of a three-frame sequence. Works rivaling the British short in length did not appear until 1905, when Edwin Porter made ''How Jones Lost His Roll'', and ''The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog''. Both of these films had intertitles which were formed by the letters moving into place from a random scattering to form the words of the titles. This was done by exposing the film one frame at a time, and moving the letters a little bit towards their final position between each exposure. This is what has come to be called \"single frame [[animation]]\" or \"object animation\", and it needs a slightly adapted camera that exposes only one frame for each turn of the crank handle, rather than the usual eight frames per turn.\n\n[[File:Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Ernst Lubitsch]] known as the master of kostumfilme]]\nIn 1906, [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert Edward Smith]] and [[J.

This is done for most of the length of this film by moving jointed cut-outs of the figures frame by frame between the exposures, just as Porter moved his letters. However, there is a very short section of the film where things are made to appear to move by altering the drawings themselves from frame to frame, which is how [[traditional animation|standard animated cartoons]] have since been made up to today.\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'', the world's first animated feature film, and ''[[Pelud\u00f3polis]]'', the first animated feature film with sound, were produced in cutout animation by Italian-born cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\n\nThe technique of single frame animation was further developed in 1907 by Edwin S. Porter in ''The Teddy Bears'' and by J. Stuart Blackton with ''Work Made Easy''. In the first of these the toy bears were made to move, apparently on their own, and in the latter film building tools were made to perform construction tasks without human intervention, by using frame-by-frame animation. The technique got to Europe almost immediately, and Segundo de Chomon and others at Path\u00e9 took it further, adding [[clay animation]], in which sculptures were deformed from one thing into another thing frame by frame in ''Sculpture moderne'' (1908), and then Path\u00e9 made the next step to the animation of silhouette shapes. Also in France, [[\u00c9mile Cohl]] fully developed drawn animation in a series of films starting with ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908), in which humans and objects drawn as outline figures went through a series of remarkable interactions and transformations. In the United States the response was from the famous strip [[Cartoonist|cartoon artist]] [[Winsor McCay]], who drew much more realistic animated figures going through smoother, more naturalistic motion in a series of films starting with the film ''Little Nemo'', made for Vitagraph in 1911. In the next few years various others took part in this development of [[animated cartoon]]s in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nThe world's first animated feature film was ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (1917), made by Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] utilizing cutout animation.{{sfn|Finkielman|2004}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=378}} Cristiani also directed the first animated feature film with sound, ''[[Pelud\u00f3polis]]'', released with a vitaphone sound-on-disc synchronization system soundtrack.

By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors in the United States quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s in operation. The American experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards.\n\nBy 1907 purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the United States, Britain and France. The films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist, though there could be more musicians. There were also a very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities. Initially, the majority of films in the programmes were [[Path\u00e9]] films, but this changed fairly quickly as the American companies cranked up production. The programme was made up of just a few films, and the show lasted around 30 minutes. The reel of film, of maximum length {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, which usually contained one individual film, became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period. The programme was changed twice or more a week, but went up to five changes of programme a week after a couple of years. In general, cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities. In 1907, Path\u00e9 began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chemulpo Bay edison.ogv|thumb|right|An early film, depicting a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Chemulpo Bay]] (Film produced in 1904 by [[Edison Studios]])|alt=A film of a re-enactment of a naval battle, depicting Russians firing at a Japanese ship with a cannon]]\nBy about 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened. Films were increasingly longer, and began to feature proper plots and development.\n\nThe litigation over patents between all the major American film-making companies led to the formation of a trust to control the American film business, with each company in the trust being allocated production quotas (two reels a week for the biggest ones, one reel a week for the smaller). However, although 6,000 exhibitors signed up to the trust, about 2,000 others did not and began to fund new film producing companies. By 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market and the government defeated the trust by initiating [[Antitrust|anti-trust]] action at the same time.\n\nIn the early 20th century, before [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], the motion picture industry was based in [[America's first motion picture industry|Fort Lee, New Jersey]] across the Hudson River from New York City.<ref>Kannapell, Andrea.

Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including [[Metro Pictures]] (later [[MGM]]), [[Edison Studios]], Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, [[Vim Comedy Company]], [[Norman Studios]], [[Gaumont Studios]] and the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]]. Comedic actor and Georgia native [[Oliver Hardy|Oliver \"Babe\" Hardy]] began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to [[Jacksonville]] in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in [[Technicolor]] and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, [[The Gulf Between]], was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.\n\nJacksonville was especially important to the [[African-American art|African American film]] industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of [[Oscar Micheaux]] and the [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]]. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as [[The Birth of a Nation]], Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed \"splendidly assuming different roles.\"\n\nJacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat [[John W. Martin]] was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern [[California]] was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like [[William Selig]] and [[D.W. Griffith]] to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.\n\nAnother factor for the industry's move west was that up until 1913, most American film production was still carried out around New York, but due to the monopoly of [[Thomas A. Edison, Inc.]]'s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it, many filmmakers moved to Southern California, starting with [[William Nicholas Selig|Selig]] in 1909. The sunshine and scenery was important for the production of Westerns, which came to form a major American film genre with the first cowboy stars, [[Broncho Billy Anderson|G.M. Anderson (\"Broncho Billy\")]] and [[Tom Mix]]. Selig pioneered the use of (fairly) wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures, with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals. [[Kalem Company]] sent film crews to places in America and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened. Kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912, with [[Ruth Roland]] playing starring roles in their Westerns.\n\nIn France, Path\u00e9 retained its dominant position, followed still by Gaumont, and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom. A film company with a different approach was Film d'Art. This was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature. Their declared programme was to make films using only the best dramatists, artists and actors. The first of these was ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise]]'' (''The Assassination of the Duc de Guise''), a historical subject set in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henri III]]. This film used leading actors from the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and had a special accompanying score written by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]. The other French majors followed suit, and this wave gave rise to the English-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as [[art film|\"art films\"]]. By 1910, the French film companies were starting to make films as long as two, or even three reels, though most were still one reel long. This trend was followed in Italy, Denmark, and Sweden.\n\nIn Britain, the [[Cinematograph Act 1909]] was the first [[primary legislation]] to specifically regulate the [[film industry]]. [[Cinematograph|Film exhibitions]] often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] for film, combined with [[limelight]] illumination, created a significant fire hazard. The Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = Juliet | title = The Thirties \u2013 an Intimate History | chapter = Prologue | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-00-724076-0}}</ref>\n\nRegular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news{{snd}} the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\u201313|British Antarctic Expedition]] to the [[South Pole]] was filmed for the newsreels as were the [[suffragette]] demonstrations that were happening at the same time.

In Italy, production was spread over several centres, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, [[Ambrosio Film|Ambrosio]] was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. Its most substantial rival was [[Cines]] in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian industry]] was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s two-reel ''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger glasses like ''[[Quo Vadis?]]'' (1912), which ran for 90 minutes, and Pastrone's ''[[Cabiria]]'' of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.\n\n[[File:cadutaW1.gif|thumb|300px|''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' (1911).]]\nItalian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy, with actors like [[Andr\u00e9 Deed]], known locally as \"Cretinetti\", and elsewhere as \"Foolshead\" and \"Gribouille\", achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags.\n\nThe most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk]] company was set up there in 1906 by [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]], a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like ''Den hvide Slavinde (The White Slave)'', ''Isbj\u00f8rnenjagt (Polar Bear Hunt)'' and ''L\u00f8vejagten (The Lion Hunt)''. By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slave trade]], they contributed other new subjects. The most important of these finds was [[Asta Nielsen]] in ''[[The Abyss (1910 film)|Afgrunden]] (The Abyss)'', directed by [[Urban Gad]] for Kosmorama, This combined the circus, sex, jealousy and murder, all put over with great conviction, and pushed the other Danish filmmakers further in this direction. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film industry]] was smaller and slower to get started than the Danish industry. Here, the important man was [[Charles Magnusson]], a newsreel cameraman for the Svenskabiografteatern cinema chain. He started fiction film production for them in 1909, directing a number of the films himself. Production increased in 1912, when the company engaged [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] and [[Mauritz Stiller]] as directors. They started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the Danish film industry, but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work, which sold very well.\n\nRussia began its film industry in 1908 with Path\u00e9 shooting some fiction subjects there, and then the creation of real Russian film companies by [[Aleksandr Drankov]] and [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]. The Khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest Russian film company, and remained so until 1918.\n\nIn Germany, [[Oskar Messter]] had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant number of films per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when [[Paul Davidson (producer)|Paul Davidson]], the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, Projektions-AG \"Union\" ([[PAGU]]), for them, that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Another of the growing German film producers just before World War I was the German branch of the French [[Eclair (company)|\u00c9clair]] company, Deutsche \u00c9clair. This was expropriated by the German government, and turned into DECLA when the war started. But altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.\n\nOverall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in all European countries except France, and even in France, the American films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of World War I. So even if the war had not happened, American films may have become dominant worldwide. Although the war made things much worse for European producers, the technical qualities of American films made them increasingly attractive to audiences everywhere.\n\n===Film technique===\n[[File:A.E. Smith filming The Bargain Fiend.gif|thumb|left|[[A.E. Smith]] filming ''The Bargain Fiend'' in the [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1907. Arc floodlights hang overhead.]]\nNew film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[Low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes.\n\nContinuity of action from shot to shot was also refined, such as in Path\u00e9's ''le Cheval emball\u00e9 (The Runaway Horse)'' (1907) where [[cross cutting|cross-cutting between parallel actions]] is used. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] also began using cross-cutting in the film ''[[The Fatal Hour (1908 film)|The Fatal Hour]]'', made in July 1908. Another development was the use of the [[point of view shot|Point of View shot]], first used in 1910 in Vitagraph's ''Back to Nature''. Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film ''La mala planta (The Evil Plant)'', directed by [[Mario Caserini]] had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the \"Evil Plant\".\n\nAs films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided.\n\n[[Intertitles]] containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards, such as in Vitagraph's ''An Auto Heroine; or, The Race for the Vitagraph Cup and How It Was Won''. The dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912. The introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative. When dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking, and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking, then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film.\n\n==During World War I==\n\n===Industry===\n[[Image:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The visual style of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' included deliberately distorted forms, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. It uses [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]]]\nThe years of the [[First World War]] were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.\n\nIn the United States, these changes brought destruction to many film companies, the Vitagraph company being an exception. Film production began to shift to [[Los Angeles]] during World War I. The [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company. New entrants included the [[Jesse L. Lasky|Jesse Lasky]] Feature Play Company, and Famous Players, both formed in 1913, and later amalgamated into [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. The biggest success of these years was [[David Wark Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Griffith followed this up with the even bigger ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), but, due to the high quality of film produced in the US, the market for their films was high.\n\nIn France, film production shut down due to the general [[Mobilization|military mobilization]] of the country at the start of the war. Although film production began again in 1915, it was on a reduced scale, and the biggest companies gradually retired from production. Italian film production held up better, although so called \"diva films\", starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure. In Denmark, the Nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films, which led to a very sharp decline in Danish production, and the end of Denmark's importance on the world film scene.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Germany|German film industry]] was seriously weakened by the war. The most important of the new film producers at the time was [[Joe May]], who made a series of thrillers and [[adventure film]]s through the war years, but [[Ernst Lubitsch]] also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas.\n\n===New techniques===\n[[File:Die Austernprinzessin screenshot.gif|thumb|300px|Complex vignette shot in ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]] (The Oyster Princess)''.]]\nAt this time, studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight. This was replaced with floodlights and spotlights. The widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period. This is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask, which gradually gets larger until it expands beyond the frame. Other shaped slits were used, including vertical and diagonal apertures.\n\nA new idea taken over from still photography was \"[[soft focus]]\". This began in 1915, with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect, as in [[Mary Pickford]] starrer ''[[Fanchon the Cricket]]''.\n\nIt was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established. These could now be done as Point of View ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots, as in Sidney Drew's ''The Story of the Glove'' (1915), where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the POV of a drunken man. The use of anamorphic (in the general sense of distorted shape) images first appears in these years with [[Abel Gance]] directed ''[[la Folie du Docteur Tube]] (The Madness of Dr. Tube)''. In this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a [[Curved mirror|distorting mirror]] of the fair-ground type.\n\nSymbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years. In D. W. Griffith's ''[[The Avenging Conscience]]'' (1914), the title \"The birth of the evil thought\" precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider, and ants eating an insect. Symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in Italy and Russia. The supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art, and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well.\n\n[[File:Screenshot from Old Wives for New.gif|thumb|600px|Insert shot in ''[[Old Wives for New]]'' ([[Cecil B. DeMille]], 1918)]]\nThe use of [[Insert (filmmaking)|insert shots]], i.e. close-ups of objects other than faces, had already been established by the Brighton school, but were infrequently used before 1914. It is really only with Griffith's ''The Avenging Conscience'' that a new phase in the use of the Insert Shot starts. As well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned, the film also made extensive use of large numbers of Big Close Up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension.\n\nAtmospheric inserts were developed in Europe in the late 1910s. This kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story, nor is a Point of View shot seen by one of them. An early example is in [[Maurice Tourneur]] directed ''[[The Pride of the Clan]]'' (1917), in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk. [[Maurice Elvey]]'s ''[[Nelson (1918 film)|Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero]]'' (1919) has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to a peacock, and then to a battleship.\n\nBy 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another. Cutting to ''different'' angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in American films. If the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees, it is called a reverse-angle cutting. The leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was [[Ralph Ince]] in his films, such as ''The Right Girl'' and ''His Phantom Sweetheart''\n\nThe use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flash-back]] structures continued to develop in this period, with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve. The Vitagraph company's ''The Man That Might Have Been'' ([[William J. Humphrey]], 1914), is even more complex, with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonist's real passage through life with what might have been, if his son had not died.\n\nAfter 1914, [[cross cutting]] between parallel actions came to be used{{snd}} more so in American films than in European ones. Cross-cutting was often used to get new effects of contrast, such as the cross-cut sequence in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Whispering Chorus]]'' (1918), in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a Chinese prostitute in an opium den, while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church.\n\n===Film art===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | width     = 300\n | image1    = \n | caption1  = The New [[Tower of Babel]], Fredersen's headquarters in [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]].\n | image2    = Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg\n | caption2  = The Tower of Babel in Maria's recounting of the fable was modeled after [[The Tower of Babel (Brueghel)|this 1563 painting]] by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]].{{sfn|Bukatman|1997|pp=62-3}}\n}}\nThe general trend in the development of cinema, led from the United States, was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories, and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing amongst American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than Griffith. DeMille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary American life. [[Maurice Tourneur]] was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films, together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy, while at the same time he was capable of getting greater [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] from his actors at appropriate moments, as in ''[[A Girl's Folly]]'' (1917).\n\n[[Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]] was the leader in developing \"polite comedy\", while slapstick was refined by [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]], who both started with [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone company. They reduced the usual frenetic pace of Sennett's films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement, and the cleverness of their gags. By 1917 Chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films, and mixing the comedy with sentiment.\n\nIn Russia, [[Yevgeni Bauer]] put a slow intensity of acting combined with Symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way.\n\nIn Sweden, [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] made a series of films that combined the realities of people's lives with their surroundings in a striking manner, while Mauritz Stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level.\n\nIn Germany, [[Ernst Lubitsch]] got his inspiration from the stage work of [[Max Reinhardt (director)|Max Reinhardt]], both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle, and applied this to his films, culminating in his ''[[The Doll (1919 film)|die Puppe]]'' (''The Doll''), ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]]'' (''The Oyster Princess'') and ''[[Madame DuBarry (1919 film)|Madame DuBarry]]''.\n\n===Hollywood triumphant===\n[[File:Charlie_Chaplin_with_doll.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Charlie Chaplin]]]]\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. The American industry, or \"Hollywood\", as it was becoming known after [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|its new geographical center in California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth.\n\nBy the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,<ref name=\"filmsite.org\"/> or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], the [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] adventures of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the romances of [[Clara Bow]], to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical [[continuity editing]] was developed and exported \u2013 although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong [[realism (arts)|realist]] traditions in art and drama, such as [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].\n\nThis development was contemporary with the growth of the [[studio system]] and its greatest publicity method, the [[star system (film)|star system]], which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios' efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system's commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous [[escapism]] discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the late teens and the 1920s.\n\n==Sound era==\n{{Main|Sound film}}\n{{See also|1930s in film}}\n[[File:DonJuanPoster2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]] is the first feature-length film to utilize the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it has no spoken dialogue.]]\nDuring late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; but this process was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]''. This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with [[phonograph]] records of talks and music. The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as [[Vitaphone]] were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods like Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].\n\nThe change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like [[Cinema of China|China]] and [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (China, 1934) and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''[[I Was Born, But...]]'' (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the [[benshi]], the live narrator who was a major part of Japanese silent cinema, found his acting career was ending.\n\nSound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called \"The Golden Age of Hollywood\", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer [[Shirley Temple]].\n\n===Creative impact of sound===\n[[File:Poster - Gone With the Wind 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]|alt=A screencap of the title card from the trailer of Gone with the Wind.]]\n\nCreatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days. The late '20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended.\n\nThis awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: [[William Wellman]] with ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' and ''[[The Man I Love (1929 film)|The Man I Love]]'', [[Rouben Mamoulian]] with ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (Britain's first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound (Eyman, 1997). In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical advances in microphones and cameras, and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming).\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the seven dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' theatrical trailer.]]\nSound films emphasized black history and benefited different [[genres]] more so than silents did. Most obviously, the [[musical film]] was born; the first classic-style Hollywood musical was ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' (1929) and the form would find its first major creator in [[choreographer]]/director [[Busby Berkeley]] (''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', 1933, ''[[Dames]]'', 1934). In France, [[avant-garde]] director [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] made [[surrealism|surreal]] use of song and dance in comedies like ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930) and ''[[Le Million]]'' (1931). [[Universal Pictures]] begin releasing [[gothic horror]] films like ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931)|Frankenstein]]'' (both 1931). In 1933, [[RKO Pictures]] released [[Merian C. Cooper]]'s classic \"giant monster\" film ''[[King Kong (1933)|King Kong]]''. The trend thrived best in [[Cinema of India|India]], where the influence of the country's traditional song-and-dance drama made the musical the basic form of most sound films (Cook, 1990); virtually unnoticed by the Western world for decades, this Indian popular cinema would nevertheless become the world's most prolific. (''See also [[Bollywood]].'')\n\nAt this time, American [[gangster film]]s like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and Wellman's ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931) became popular. Dialogue now took precedence over \"slapstick\" in Hollywood comedies: the fast-paced, witty banter of ''[[The Front Page]]'' (1931) or ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), the sexual double entrendres of [[Mae West]] (''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', 1933) or the often subversively anarchic nonsense talk of the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', 1933). [[Walt Disney]], who had previously been in the short cartoon business, stepped into feature films with the first English-speaking animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; released by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1937. 1939, a major year for American cinema, brought such films as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with The Wind]]''.\n\n== Color in cinema ==\nPreviously, it was believed that color films were first projected in 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London (the main problem with the color being that the technique, created by George Smith, ([[Kinemacolor]]) only used two colors: green and red, which were mixed additively). But in fact, it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created. This untitled film was directed by photographer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] and his patron [[Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1871)|Frederick Marshall Lee]]. The way they did it was to use black and white film rolls, but have green, red, and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot. To complete the film, they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector. However, both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that, eventually, sank the idea.\n\nSubsequently, in 1916, the [[technicolor]] technique arrived (trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue). Its use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions). The first audiovisual piece that was completely realized with this technique was the short of [[Walt Disney]] \"[[Flowers and Trees]]\", directed by [[Burt Gillett]] in 1932. Even so, the first film to be performed with this technique will be \"The Vanities Fair\" (1935) by Rouben Mamoulian. Later on, the technicolor was extended mainly in the musical field as \"[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]\" or \"[[Singin' in the Rain|Singing in the rain]]\", in films such as \"[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]\" or the animation film, \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\".<ref name=\"esquire1\"/>\n\n==World War II and its aftermath==\n{{Main|1940s in film}}\nThe desire for wartime propaganda against the opposition created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas like ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942), ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944) and [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s celebrated naval film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' in 1942, which won a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. These existed alongside more flamboyant films like [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944) and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), as well as [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[1944 in film|1944 film]] ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'', based on the [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespearean history]] ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. The success of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' allowed Disney to make more animated features like ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941) and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942).\n\nThe onset of US involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. American propaganda films included ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942), ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''  (1942), ''[[Forever and a Day (1943 film)|Forever and a Day]]'' (1943) and ''[[Objective, Burma!]]'' (1945). Notable American films from the war years include the anti-Nazi ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]'' (1943), scripted by [[Dashiell Hammett]]; ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's direction of a script by [[Thornton Wilder]]; the [[George M. Cohan]] [[biopic]], ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), starring [[James Cagney]], and the immensely popular ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart would star in 36 films between 1934 and 1942 including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), one of the first films now considered a classic [[film noir]]. In 1941, [[RKO Pictures]] released ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' made by [[Orson Welles]]. It is often considered the greatest film of all time. It would set the stage for the modern motion picture, as it revolutionized film story telling.\n\nThe strictures of wartime also brought an interest in more fantastical subjects. These included Britain's [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] melodramas (including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]''), and films like ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', ''I Married a Witch'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|Blithe Spirit]]''. [[Val Lewton]] also produced a series of atmospheric and influential small-budget [[horror film|horror]] films, some of the more famous examples being ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'', ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. The decade probably also saw the so-called \"women's pictures\", such as ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'' and ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' at the peak of their popularity.\n\n1946 saw RKO Radio releasing ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' directed by [[Frank Capra]]. Soldiers returning from the war would provide the inspiration for films like ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', and many of those in the film industry had served in some capacity during the war. [[Samuel Fuller]]'s experiences in World War II would influence his largely autobiographical films of later decades such as ''[[The Big Red One]]''. [[The Actor's Studio]] was founded in October 1947 by [[Elia Kazan]], [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], and the same year [[Oskar Fischinger]] filmed ''[[Motion Painting No. 1]]''.\n\nIn 1943, ''Ossessione'' was screened in Italy, marking the beginning of [[Italian neorealism]]. Major films of this type during the 1940s included ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', and ''[[La Terra Trema]]''. In 1952 ''[[Umberto D]]'' was released, usually considered the last film of this type.\n\nIn the late 1940s, in Britain, [[Ealing Studios]] embarked on their series of celebrated comedies, including ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore!]]'', ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]'', and [[Carol Reed]] directed his influential thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', ''[[The Fallen Idol (film)|The Fallen Idol]]'' and ''[[The Third Man]]''. [[David Lean]] was also rapidly becoming a force in world cinema with ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and his [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', and [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] would experience the best of their creative partnership with films like ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''.\n\n==1950s==\n{{Main|1950s in film}}\n[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|300px|A production scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].]]\nThe [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. Protested by the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] before the committee, the hearings resulted in the [[blacklist]]ing of many actors, writers and directors, including Chayefsky, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Dalton Trumbo]], and many of these fled to Europe, especially the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Cold War|Cold War era]] [[zeitgeist]] translated into a type of near-[[paranoia]] manifested in [[theme (literature)|theme]]s such as [[alien invasion|invading armies of evil aliens]], (''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''); and [[communism|communist]] [[fifth column]]ists, (''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'').\n\nDuring the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television, and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The demise of the \"studio system\" spurred the [[Criticism|self-commentary]] of films like ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1950, the [[Lettrists]] avante-gardists caused riots at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], when [[Isidore Isou]]'s ''Treatise on Slime and Eternity'' was screened. After their criticism of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and split with the movement, the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new [[hypergraphics|hypergraphical]] techniques.\nThe most notorious film is [[Guy Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' of 1952.\n\nDistressed by the increasing number of closed theatres, studios and companies would find new and innovative ways to bring audiences back. These included attempts to widen their appeal with new screen formats. [[Cinemascope]], which would remain a [[20th Century Fox]] distinction until 1967, was announced with 1953's ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. [[VistaVision]], [[Cinerama]], and [[Todd-AO]] boasted a \"bigger is better\" approach to [[marketing]] films to a dwindling US audience. This resulted in the revival of epic films to take advantage of the new big screen formats. Some of the most successful examples of these [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[history|historical]] spectaculars include ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Also during this period a number of other significant films were produced in [[Todd-AO]], developed by [[Mike Todd]] shortly before his death, including [[Oklahoma!]] (1955), [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]] (1956), [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]] (1958) and [[Cleopatra]] (1963) plus many more.\n\n[[Gimmick]]s also proliferated to lure in audiences. The fad for [[3-D film]] would last for only two years, 1952\u20131954, and helped sell ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. Producer [[William Castle]] would tout films featuring \"Emergo\" \"Percepto\", the first of a series of gimmicks that would remain popular marketing tools for Castle and others throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the U.S., a post-WW2 tendency toward questioning the establishment and societal norms and the early [[activism]] of the [[civil rights movement]] was reflected in Hollywood films such as ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' (1955), ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' and [[Reginald Rose]]'s ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957). Disney continued making animated films, notably; ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). He began, however, getting more involved in live action films, producing classics like ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), and ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957). Television began competing seriously with films projected in theatres, but surprisingly it promoted more filmgoing rather than curtailing it.\n\n''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' is probably a unique film in at least one interesting respect. Its two leads, [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Claire Bloom]], were in the industry in no less than three different centuries. In the 19th Century, Chaplin made his theatrical debut at the age of eight, in 1897, in a clog dancing troupe, The Eight Lancaster Lads. In the 21st Century, Bloom is still enjoying a full and productive career, having appeared in dozens of films and television series produced up to and including 2013.  She received particular acclaim for her role in ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010).\n\n===Golden age of Asian cinema===\n{{Main|Asian cinema}}\n[[File:Satyajit Ray.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Satyajit Ray]], [[India]]n [[Bengali people|Bengali]] film director.]]\nFollowing the end of World War II in the 1940s, the following decade, the 1950s, marked a 'golden age' for non-English [[world cinema]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Age of the Foreign Film |publisher=[[Film Forum]] |url=http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/golden.html |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619154125/http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/golden.html |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name=Daniels>{{cite web|title=Hybrid Cinematics: Rethinking the role of filmmakers of color in American Cinema|author=Tracy K.

''Rashomon'' was also remade as ''[[The Outrage]]'' (1964), and inspired films with \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" storytelling methods, such as ''[[Andha Naal]]'' (1954), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002).

South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy ''Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)'', had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 films were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|first=Darcy|last=Paquet|title=1945\u20131959|publisher=Korean Film Page|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm45-59.html|accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s was also a 'Golden Age' for [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]], with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included [[Gerardo de Leon]], [[Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez (director)|Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Eddie Romero]], [[Lamberto Avellana]], and [[Cirio Santiago]].<ref name=\"curtain\">[http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?].

Accessed January 22, 2009.</ref>\n\n==1960s==\n{{Main|1960s in film}}\nDuring the 1960s, the studio system in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] declined, because many films were now being made on location in other countries, or using studio facilities abroad, such as [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] in the UK and [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in Rome. \"Hollywood\" films were still largely aimed at family audiences, and it was often the more old-fashioned films that produced the studios' biggest successes. Productions like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) were among the biggest money-makers of the decade. The growth in independent producers and production companies, and the increase in the power of individual actors also contributed to the decline of traditional Hollywood studio production.\n\nThere was also an increasing awareness of foreign language cinema in America during this period. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the [[French New Wave]] directors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] produced films such as ''[[The 400 Blows|Les quatre cents coups]]'', ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' and ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' which broke the rules of Hollywood cinema's [[narrative structure]]. As well, audiences were becoming aware of Italian films like [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' and the stark dramas of Sweden's [[Ingmar Bergman]].\n\nIn Britain, the \"Free Cinema\" of [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Tony Richardson]] and others lead to a group of realistic and innovative dramas including ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' and ''[[This Sporting Life]]''. Other British films such as ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (all in 1965\u20131966) helped to reduce prohibitions sex and nudity on screen, while the casual sex and violence of the [[James Bond]] films, beginning with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 would render the series popular worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne]] produced several French- and [[Wolof language|Wolof-language]] films and became the \"father\" of [[African Cinema]]. In Latin America, the dominance of the \"Hollywood\" model was challenged by many film makers. [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]] called for a politically engaged [[Third Cinema]] in contrast to Hollywood and the European [[auteur]] cinema.\n\nFurther, the nuclear paranoia of the age, and the threat of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange (like the 1962 close-call with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]]) prompted a reaction within the film community as well. Films like [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] were produced in a Hollywood that was once known for its overt patriotism and wartime propaganda.\n\nIn [[documentary film]] the sixties saw the blossoming of [[Direct Cinema]], an observational style of film making as well as the advent of more overtly partisan films like ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]'' about the [[Vietnam War]] by [[Emile de Antonio]]. By the late 1960s however, Hollywood filmmakers were beginning to create more innovative and groundbreaking films that reflected the social revolution taken over much of the western world such as ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' is often considered the beginning of the so-called [[New Hollywood]].\n\nIn Japanese cinema, Academy Award-winning director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), which like his previous films also had a profound influence around the world. The influence of this film is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend.\n\n==1970s==\n{{Main|1970s in film}}\nThe [[New Hollywood]] was the period following the decline of the [[studio system]] during the 1950s and 1960s and the end of the [[production code]], (which was replaced in 1968 by the [[MPAA film rating system]]). During the 1970s, filmmakers increasingly depicted explicit sexual content and showed gunfight and battle scenes that included graphic images of bloody deaths{{snd}} a good example of this is [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).\n\nPost-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling of the New Hollywood producers. The new methods of [[drama]] and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired during the classical/Golden Age period: story chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature unsettling \"[[twist ending]]s\", main characters may behave in a morally ambiguous fashion, and the lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The beginnings of post-classical storytelling may be seen in 1940s and 1950s [[film noir]] films, in films such as ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. 1971 marked the release of controversial films like ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. This sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a new group of American filmmakers emerged, such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Terrence Malick]], and [[Robert Altman]]. This coincided with the increasing popularity of the [[auteur theory]] in film literature and the media, which posited that a film director's films express their personal vision and creative insights. The development of the auteur style of filmmaking helped to give these directors far greater control over their projects than would have been possible in earlier eras. This led to some great critical and commercial successes, like Scorsese's ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' films, [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', Altman's ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', Allen's ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', Malick's ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' and ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and Polish immigrant [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. It also, however, resulted in some failures, including [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' and [[Michael Cimino]]'s hugely expensive Western epic ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which helped to bring about the demise of its backer, [[United Artists]].\n\nThe financial disaster of ''Heaven's Gate'' marked the end of the visionary \"auteur\" directors of the \"New Hollywood\", who had unrestrained creative and financial freedom to develop films. The phenomenal success in the 1970s of [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' originated the concept of the modern \"[[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]\". However, the enormous success of George Lucas' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' led to much more than just the popularization of blockbuster film-making. The film's revolutionary use of special effects, sound editing and music had led it to become widely regarded as one of the single most important films in the medium's history, as well as the most influential film of the 1970s. Hollywood studios increasingly focused on producing a smaller number of very large budget films with massive marketing and promotional campaigns. This trend had already been foreshadowed by the commercial success of [[disaster film]]s such as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]''.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, more pornographic theatres, euphemistically called \"adult cinemas\", were established, and the legal production of [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films began. Porn films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and its star [[Linda Lovelace]] became something of a popular culture phenomenon and resulted in a spate of similar sex films. The porn cinemas finally died out during the 1980s, when the popularization of the home [[VCR]] and pornography videotapes allowed audiences to watch sex films at home. In the early 1970s, English-language audiences became more aware of the new [[West German]] cinema, with [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and [[Wim Wenders]] among its leading exponents.\n\nIn [[world cinema]], the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of [[martial arts film]]s, largely due to its reinvention by [[Bruce Lee]], who departed from the artistic style of traditional [[Chinese martial arts]] films and added a much greater sense of realism to them with his [[Jeet Kune Do]] style. This began with ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which was a major success across [[Asian cinema|Asia]]. However, he didn't gain fame in the [[Western world]] until shortly after his death in 1973, when ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' was released. The film went on to become the most successful martial arts film in cinematic history, popularized the martial arts film genre across the world, and cemented Bruce Lee's status as a cultural icon. [[Hong Kong action cinema]], however, was in decline due to a wave of \"[[Bruceploitation]]\" films. This trend eventually came to an end in 1978 with the martial arts [[comedy film]]s, ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and starring [[Jackie Chan]], laying the foundations for the rise of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s.\n\nWhile the [[musical film]] genre had declined in Hollywood by this time, musical films were quickly gaining popularity in the [[cinema of India]], where the term \"[[Bollywood]]\" was coined for the growing [[Hindi]] film industry in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that ended up dominating [[South Asian cinema]], overtaking the more critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] in popularity. Hindi filmmakers combined the Hollywood musical formula with the conventions of ancient [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] to create a new film genre called \"[[Masala (film genre)|Masala]]\", which dominated Indian cinema throughout the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K. Moti Gokulsing|first=K. Gokulsing, Wimal Dissanayake|publisher=Trentham Books|year=2004|isbn=1-85856-329-1|pages=98\u201399}}</ref> These \"Masala\" films portrayed [[Action film|action]], comedy, [[Drama film|drama]], [[Romance film|romance]] and [[melodrama]] all at once, with \"[[filmi]]\" song and dance routines thrown in. This trend began with films directed by [[Manmohan Desai]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who remains one of the most popular [[film star]]s in South Asia. The most popular Indian film of all time was ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), a \"Masala\" film inspired by a real-life [[Dacoity|dacoit]] as well as Kurosawa's ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and the [[Spaghetti Western]]s.\n\nThe end of the decade saw the first major international marketing of [[Australia]]n cinema, as [[Peter Weir]]'s films ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[The Last Wave]]'' and [[Fred Schepisi]]'s ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' gained critical acclaim. In 1979, Australian filmmaker [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] also garnered international attention for his violent, low-budget action film ''[[Mad Max]]''.\n\n==1980s==\n{{Main|1980s in film}}\n[[File:The_Expendables_2_Cast_Roster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ensemble cast of action stars of the 80s, including (left to right) [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Terry Crews]]]]\nDuring the 1980s, audiences began increasingly watching films on their home [[VCR]]s. In the early part of that decade, the [[film studio]]s tried legal action to ban home ownership of VCRs as a violation of [[copyright]], which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, the sale and rental of films on [[home video]] became a significant \"second venue\" for exhibition of films, and an additional source of revenue for the film industries.\n\nThe [[George Lucas|Lucas]]\u2013[[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] combine would dominate \"Hollywood\" cinema for much of the 1980s, and lead to much imitation. Two follow-ups to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', three to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and three ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films helped to make sequels of successful films more of an expectation than ever before. Lucas also launched [[THX|THX Ltd]], a division of [[Lucasfilm]] in 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |title=THX Milestones |accessdate=2006-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109131348/http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |archivedate=2006-11-09 |df= }}</ref> while Spielberg enjoyed one of the decade's greatest successes in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' the same year. 1982 also saw the release of Disney's ''[[Tron]]'' which was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively. American independent cinema struggled more during the decade, although [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983) helped to establish him as one of the most critically acclaimed American film makers of the era. Also during 1983 ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' was released, which was very profitable and resulted in even greater fame for its leading actor [[Al Pacino]]. Probably{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} the most successful film commercially was [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 version of [[Bob Kane]]'s creation, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which broke box-office records. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of the demented [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] earned him a total of $60,000,000 after figuring in his percentage of the gross.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBritish cinema was given a boost during the early 1980s by the arrival of [[David Puttnam]]'s company [[Goldcrest Films]]. The films ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' and ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'' appealed to a \"middlebrow\" audience which was increasingly being ignored by the major Hollywood studios. While the films of the 1970s had helped to define modern [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion pictures, the way \"Hollywood\" released its films would now change. Films, for the most part, would premiere in a wider number of theatres, although, to this day, some films still premiere using the route of the [[Roadshow theatrical release|limited/roadshow release system]]. Against some expectations, the rise of the multiplex cinema did not allow less mainstream films to be shown, but simply allowed the major blockbusters to be given an even greater number of screenings. However, films that had been overlooked in cinemas were increasingly being given a second chance on home video.\n\n[[File:Cannes_2014_2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ensemble cast of action stars end of the 80's \t\n[[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Jet Li]], [[Wesley Snipes]],\n[[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Glen Powell]], [[Victor Ortiz]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]]]\nDuring the 1980s, [[Japanese cinema]] experienced a revival, largely due to the success of [[anime]] films. At the beginning of the 1980s, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1973) and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' (1979), both of which were unsuccessful as television series, were remade as films and became hugely successful in Japan. In particular, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' sparked the [[Gundam]] franchise of [[Real Robot]] [[mecha]] anime. The success of ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' also sparked a [[Macross]] franchise of mecha anime. This was also the decade when [[Studio Ghibli]] was founded. The studio produced [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s first [[fantasy film]]s, ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984) and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986), as well as [[Isao Takahata]]'s ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' (1988), all of which were very successful in Japan and received worldwide critical acclaim. [[Original video animation]] (OVA) films also began during this decade; the most influential of these early OVA films was [[Noboru Ishiguro]]'s [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' (1985). The most famous anime film of this decade was [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s cyberpunk film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988), which although initially unsuccessful at Japanese theaters, went on to become an international success.\n\n[[Hong Kong action cinema]], which was in a state of decline due to endless [[Bruceploitation]] films after the death of [[Bruce Lee]], also experienced a revival in the 1980s, largely due to the reinvention of the [[action film]] genre by [[Jackie Chan]]. He had previously combined the [[comedy film]] and [[martial arts film]] genres successfully in the 1978 films ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]''. The next step he took was in combining this comedy martial arts genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and highly dangerous [[stunt]]s, reminiscent of the [[silent film]] era. The first film in this new style of action cinema was ''[[Project A]]'' (1983), which saw the formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] as well as the \"Three Brothers\" (Chan, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]). The film added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and [[slapstick]] humor, and became a huge success throughout the [[Far East]]. As a result, Chan continued this trend with martial arts action films containing even more elaborate and dangerous stunts, including ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985), ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'' (1986), ''[[Project A Part II]]'' (1987), ''[[Police Story 2]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'' (1988). Other new trends which began in the 1980s were the \"[[girls with guns]]\" subgenre, for which [[Michelle Yeoh]] gained fame; and especially the \"[[heroic bloodshed]]\" genre, revolving around [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]], largely pioneered by [[John Woo]] and for which [[Chow Yun-fat]] became famous. These Hong Kong action trends were later adopted by many Hollywood action films in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n==1990s==\n{{Main|1990s in film}}\nThe early 1990s saw the development of a commercially successful independent cinema in the United States. Although cinema was increasingly dominated by special-effects films such as ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), the latter of which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time up until ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), also directed by James Cameron, independent films like [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989) and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) had significant commercial success both at the cinema and on home video. Filmmakers associated with the Danish film movement [[Dogme 95]] introduced a manifesto aimed to purify filmmaking. Its first few films gained worldwide critical acclaim, after which the movement slowly faded out.\n\n[[File:1995cinema admissions.png|thumb|250px|right|Cinema admissions in 1995]]\nMajor American studios began to create their own [[independent film|\"independent\" production companies]] to finance and produce non-mainstream fare. One of the most successful independents of the 1990s, [[Miramax Films]], was bought by Disney the year before the release of Tarantino's runaway hit ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' in 1994. The same year marked the beginning of film and video distribution online. Animated films aimed at family audiences also regained their popularity, with Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). During 1995, the first feature length [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] feature, ''[[Toy Story]]'', was produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by Disney. After the success of Toy Story, computer animation would grow to become the dominant technique for feature length animation, which would allow competing film companies such as [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[20th Century Fox]] to effectively compete with Disney with successful films of their own. During the late 1990s, another cinematic transition began, from physical film stock to [[digital cinema]] technology. Meanwhile, [[DVD]]s became the new standard for consumer video, replacing VHS tapes.\n\n==Recent years==\n{{Main|2000s in film|2010s in film}}\nThe [[documentary film]] also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time, with the success of films such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. A new genre was created with [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq, transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers. The success of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' led to a revival of interest in [[epic film|epic cinema]], and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' renewed interest in [[musical film|musical cinema]]. [[home cinema|Home theatre]] systems became increasingly sophisticated, as did some of the special edition [[DVD]]s designed to be shown on them. ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]'' was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences.\n\nIn 2001, the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] began, and by its end in 2011, it had become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time until the Marvel Cinematic Universe passed it in 2015.\n\nMore films were also being released simultaneously to [[IMAX]] cinema, the first was in 2002's Disney animation ''[[Treasure Planet]]''; and the first live action was in 2003's ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and a re-release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Later in the decade, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was the first major feature film to have been at least partially shot in IMAX technology.\n\nThere has been an increasing globalization of cinema during this decade, with foreign-language films gaining popularity in English-speaking markets. Examples of such films include ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (Mandarin), ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (French), ''[[Lagaan]]'' (Hindi), ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japanese), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (Brazilian Portuguese), ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (Aramaic), ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (Mayan) and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (multiple European languages). Italy is the most awarded country at the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|nominations]].\n\nIn 2003 there was a revival in 3D film popularity the first being James Cameron's ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' which was released as the first full-length 3-D IMAX feature filmed with the [[Reality Camera System]]. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Emmy nominated Director of Photography Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film ''[[Spy Kids 3D: Game Over]]'' (2003), ''[[Aliens of the Deep]]'' IMAX (2005), and ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]'' (2005).\n\nAfter James Cameron's 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the highest-grossing film of all time, 3D films gained brief popularity with many other films being released in 3D, with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation such as [[Universal Pictures]]/[[Illumination Entertainment]]'s ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[How To Train Your Dragon (film)|How To Train Your Dragon]]'', ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and ''[[Megamind]]''. ''Avatar'' is also note-worthy for pioneering highly sophisticated use of motion capture technology and influencing several other films such as ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''. However the popularity of 3D steadily declined over the subsequent seven years to 2017.<ref>https://variety.com/2018/film/news/3d-box-office-1202743603/</ref>\n\n{{as of|2010}}, the largest film industries by number of feature films produced were those of India, the United States, China, Nigeria and Japan.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2044888,00.html| title=As Its Box Office Booms, Chinese Cinema Makes a 3-D Push | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Brenhouse, Hillary|date=2011-01-31| accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> Beginning in 2008 with ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', [[superhero film]]s have greatly increased in popularity and financial success, with films based on [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC comics]] regularly being released every year up to the present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Helmore|first1=Edward|title=They're here to save the world: but how many superhero movies can we take?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/01/superhero-movies-black-panther-captain-marvel|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=1 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[B movie]]\n*[[Culture-historical archaeology]]\n*[[Experimental film]]\n*[[Fictional film]]\n*''[[Film & History]]''\n*[[Film noir]]\n*''[[History of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope, and Kinetophonograph]]''\n*[[History of science fiction films]]\n*''[[Kammerspielfilm]]''\n*[[List of books on films]]\n*[[List of cinematic firsts]]\n*[[List of cinema of the world]]\n*[[List of color film systems]]\n*[[List of film formats]]\n*[[List of years in film]]\n*[[List of the first films by country]]\n*[[Newsreel]]\n*[[Outline of film]]\n*[[Runaway production]]\n*[[Silent film]]\n*[[Sound film]]\n*''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey]]''\n*[[Women's cinema]]\n*[[Visual effects]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|last=Munslow|first=Alun|title=Film and history: Robert A.

It is noted for having a particularly strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the [[French government]].<ref name=\"NYT 1995-02-28\" />\n\nApart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as [[Poland]] ([[Roman Polanski]], [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and [[Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski]]), [[Argentina]] ([[Gaspar No\u00e9]] and [[Edgardo Cozarinsky]]), [[Russia]] ([[Alexandre Alexeieff]], [[Anatole Litvak]]), Austria ([[Michael Haneke]]), and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[G\u00e9la Babluani]], [[Otar Iosseliani]]) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as [[Luc Besson]], [[Jacques Tourneur]], or [[Francis Veber]] in the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]].\n\nAnother element supporting this fact is that [[Paris]] has the highest density of cinemas in the world, measured by the  number of [[movie theaters]] per inhabitant,<ref>[http://old.campusfrance.org/en/a-etudier/faq.htm 20 questions about studying in France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504080519/http://old.campusfrance.org/en/a-etudier/faq.htm |date=2011-05-04 }}</ref> and that in most \"downtown Paris\" movie theaters, foreign movies which would be secluded to \"art houses\" cinemas in other places are shown alongside \"mainstream\" works.

[[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re]] invented the [[cin\u00e9matographe]] and their ''[[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]'' in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography.\n\nThe early days of the industry, from 1896 to 1902, saw the dominance of four firms:  [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]], the [[Gaumont Film Company]], the [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] company, and [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|the Lumi\u00e8res]].<ref name=\"Town 1914\">The Cin\u00e9 Goes to Town:  French Cinema 1896\u20131914, Richard Abel</ref>  M\u00e9li\u00e8s invented many of the techniques of cinematic grammar, and among his fantastic, surreal short subjects is the first [[science fiction film]] ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (''Le Voyage dans la Lune'') in 1902).\n\nIn 1902 [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|the Lumi\u00e8res]] abandoned everything but the production of film stock, leaving M\u00e9li\u00e8s as the weakest player of the remaining three.  (He would retire in 1914.)  From 1904 to 1911 the [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]] company led the world in film production and distribution.<ref name=\"Town 1914\" />\n\nAt Gaumont, pioneer [[Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9]] (M. Gaumont's former secretary) was made head of production and oversaw about 400 films, from her first, ''[[La F\u00e9e aux Choux]]'', in 1896, through 1906.  She then continued her career in the United States, as did [[Maurice Tourneur]] and [[L\u00e9once Perret]] after World War I.\n\nIn 1907 Gaumont owned and operated the biggest movie studio in the world, and along with the boom in construction of \"luxury cinemas\" like the Gaumont-Palace and the Path\u00e9-Palace (both 1911), cinema became an economic challenger to legitimate theater by 1914.<ref name=\"Town 1914\" />\n\n=== After World War I ===\nAfter World War I, the French film industry suffered because of a lack of capital, and film production decreased as it did in most other European countries. This allowed the United States film industry to enter the European cinema market, because American films could be sold more cheaply than European productions, since the studios already had recouped their costs in the home market. When film studios in Europe began to fail, many European countries began to set import barriers. France installed an import quota of 1:7, meaning for every seven foreign films imported to France, one French film was to be produced and shown in French cinemas.<ref>L'Estrange Fawcett: Die Welt des Films. Amalthea-Verlag, Z\u00fcrich, Leipzig, Wien 1928, p. 149 (German translation of Fawcett's book of 1928: ''Film, Facts and Forecasts'')</ref>\n\nDuring the period between World War I and World War II, [[Jacques Feyder]] and [[Jean Vigo]] became two of the founders of [[poetic realism]] in French cinema. They also dominated [[French impressionist cinema]], along with [[Abel Gance]], [[Germaine Dulac]] and [[Jean Epstein]].\n\nIn 1931, [[Marcel Pagnol]] filmed the first of his great trilogy ''[[Marius (film)|Marius]]'', ''Fanny'', and ''C\u00e9sar''. He followed this with other films including ''[[The Baker's Wife (film)|The Baker's Wife]]''. Other notable films of the 1930s included [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]]'s ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930), Jean Vigo's ''[[L'Atalante]]'' (1934), Jacques Feyder's ''[[Carnival in Flanders (film)|Carnival in Flanders]]'' (1935), and [[Julien Duvivier]]'s ''La belle equipe'' (1936). In 1935, renowned playwright and actor [[Sacha Guitry]] directed his first film and went on to make more than 30 films that were precursors to the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] era. In 1937, [[Jean Renoir]], the son of painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], directed ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (''The Grand Illusion''). In 1939, Renoir directed ''[[The Rules of the Game|La R\u00e8gle du Jeu]]'' (''The Rules of the Game'').  Several critics have cited this film as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest of all-time]], particularly for its innovative camerawork, cinematography and sound editing.\n\n[[Marcel Carn\u00e9]]'s ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' (''Children of Paradise'') was filmed during World War II and released in 1945. The three-hour film was extremely difficult to make due to the [[Nazi occupation of France|Nazi occupation]]. Set in Paris in 1828, it was voted Best French Film of the Century in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals in the late [[1990s in film|1990s]].\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n\n==== 1940s\u20131970s ====\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Alain Delon in Belgrade, 1962 (1).JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Alain Delon]] was known as much for his beauty as for his acting career and holds an enduring status as a leading man in French cinema.]]\nIn the magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', founded by [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] and two other writers in 1951, film critics raised the level of discussion of the cinema, providing a platform for the birth of modern [[film theory]].  Several of the ''Cahiers'' critics, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jacques Rivette]] and [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]], went on to make films themselves, creating what was to become known as the [[French New Wave]]. Some of the first films of this new movement were Godard's ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (''\u00c0 bout de souffle'', 1960), starring [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], Rivette's ''[[Paris Belongs to Us]]'' (''Paris nous appartient'', 1958 \u2013 distributed in 1961), starring [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] and Truffaut's ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (''Les Quatre Cent Coups'', 1959) starring [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]]. \n\nMany contemporaries of Godard and Truffaut followed suit, or achieved international critical acclaim with styles of their own, such as the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] films of [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], the Hitchcockian-like thrillers of [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and other New Wave films by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] and [[Alain Resnais]]. The movement, while an inspiration to other national cinemas and unmistakably a direct influence on the future [[New Hollywood]] directors, slowly faded by the end of the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Bardot - 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Brigitte Bardot]] was one of the most famous French actresses in the 1960s.]]\n[[File:Leslie Caron - Maruice Chevalier - 1957.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The French actress [[Leslie Caron]] with [[Maurice Chevalier]] on the set of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).]]\nDuring this period, French commercial film also made a name for itself. Immensely popular French comedies with [[Louis de Fun\u00e8s]] topped the French box office. The war comedy ''[[La Grande Vadrouille]]'' (1966), from [[G\u00e9rard Oury]] with [[Bourvil]] and [[Terry-Thomas]], was the most successful film in French theaters for more than 30 years. Another example was ''[[Delusions of Grandeur (film)|La Folie des grandeurs]]'' with [[Yves Montand]]. French cinema also was the birthplace for many subgenres of the [[crime film]], most notably the modern [[caper film]], starting with 1955's ''[[Rififi]]'' by American-born director [[Jules Dassin]] and followed by a large number of serious, noirish heist dramas as well as playful caper comedies throughout the sixties, and the \"polar,\" a typical French blend of [[film noir]] and [[detective fiction]]. In addition, French movie stars began to claim fame abroad as well as at home. Popular actors of the period included [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Yves Montand]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[Jean Gabin]]. Since the Sixties and Seventies they are completed and followed by [[Michel Piccoli]], [[Philippe Noiret]], [[Annie Girardot]], [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]], [[Claude Jade]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Anny Duperey]], [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], [[Patrick Dewaere]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Miou-Miou]], [[Brigitte Fossey]], [[St\u00e9phane Audran]] and [[Isabelle Adjani]].\n\nThe 1979 film ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' ran for well over a year at the [[Paris Theatre]], an [[arthouse cinema]] in New York City, and was a commercial success at theaters throughout the country, in both urban and rural areas. It won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and for years it remained the most successful foreign film to be released in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=foreign.htm |title=Foreign Languages Movies |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724001435/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=foreign.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n[[File:DARRIEUX Danielle-24x30-2008b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danielle Darrieux]] (pictured in 2008) was a French centenarian,  who had one of the longest careers in French cinema, spanning eight decades]]\n\n==== 1980s ====\n[[Jean-Jacques Beineix]]'s ''[[Diva (1981 film)|Diva]]'' (1981) sparked the beginning of the 1980s wave of French cinema. Movies which followed in its wake included ''[[Betty Blue]]'' (''37\u00b02 le matin'', 1986) by Beineix, ''[[The Big Blue]]'' (''Le Grand bleu'', 1988) by [[Luc Besson]], and ''[[The Lovers on the Bridge]]'' (''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'', 1991) by [[L\u00e9os Carax]]. These films, made with a slick commercial style and emphasizing the alienation of its main characters, was known as [[Cinema du look]].\n\n''[[Camille Claudel (film)|Camille Claudel]]'', directed by newcomer [[Bruno Nuytten]] and starring [[Isabelle Adjani]] and [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], was a major commercial success in 1988, earning Adjani, who was also the film's co-producer, a [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for best actress. The [[historical fiction|historical drama]] film ''[[Jean de Florette]]'' (1986) and its sequel ''[[Manon des Sources (1986 film)|Manon des Sources]]'' (1986) were among the highest grossing French films in history and brought Daniel Auteuil international recognition.\n\nAccording to [[Rapha\u00ebl Bassan]], in his article \u00ab''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'': Un m\u00e9t\u00e9ore dans le ciel de l'animation,\u00bb ''La Revue du cin\u00e9ma'', n\u00b0 393, avril 1984. {{fr icon}}, [[Patrick Bokanowski]]'s ''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'', shown in [[1982 in film|1982]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], can be considered the beginnings of contemporary animation. The masks erase all human personality in the characters. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] would thus have total control over the \"matter\" of the image and its optical composition. This is especially noticeable throughout the film, with images taken through distorted objectives or a plastic work on the sets and costumes, for example in the scene of the designer. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] creates his own universe and obeys his own aesthetic logic. It takes us through a series of distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses and synthetic objects. Indeed, in the film, the human may be viewed as a fetish object (for example, the doll hanging by a thread), with reference to [[Franz Kafka#\"Kafkaesque\"|Kafkaesque]] and [[Siegmund Freud|Freudian]] theories on [[automaton|automata]] and the fear of man faced with something as complex as him. The ascent of the stairs would be the liberation of the ideas of death, culture, and sex that makes us reach the emblematic figure of the angel.\n\n==== 1990s ====\n[[File:Palmed'or.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palme d'Or]] (\"Golden Palm\"), the most prestigious award given out at [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]\nJean-Paul Rappeneau's ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1990 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' was a major box-office success in 1990, earning several [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s, including best actor for [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], as well as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for best foreign picture.\n\n[[Luc Besson]] made ''[[Nikita (film)|Nikita]]'' in 1990, a movie that inspired remakes in both United States and in Hong Kong. In 1994, he also made ''[[L\u00e9on: The Professional|L\u00e9on]]'' and in 1997 ''[[The Fifth Element]]'', which both became a cult favorite and launched the careers of [[Natalie Portman]] and [[Milla Jovovich]].\n\n[[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] made ''[[Delicatessen (film)|Delicatessen]]'' and ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' (''La Cit\u00e9 des enfants perdus''), both of which featured a distinctly fantastical style.\n\nIn 1992, [[Claude Sautet]] co-wrote (with Jacques Fieschi) and directed ''[[Un Coeur en Hiver]]'', considered by many to be a masterpiece. [[Mathieu Kassovitz]]'s 1995 film ''Hate'' (''[[La Haine]]'') received critical praise and made [[Vincent Cassel]] a star, and in 1997, [[Juliette Binoche]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.\n\nThe success of [[Michel Ocelot]]'s ''[[Kirikou and the Sorceress]]'' in 1998 rejuvenated the production of original feature-length animated films by such filmmakers as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laguionie]] and [[Sylvain Chomet]].\n\n==== 2000s ====\n[[File:Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System, Mark V, Paris, 2000 - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|First [[digital cinema]] projection in Paris with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]] (2000).]]\nIn 2000, Philippe Binant realized the first [[digital cinema]] projection in [[Europe]], with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]], in Paris.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"google.com\"/>\n\nIn 2001, after a brief stint in Hollywood, [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] returned to France with ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (''Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain'') starring [[Audrey Tautou]]. It became the highest-grossing French-language film ever released in the United States. The following year, ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980 and went on to gross more than $70 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, [[Marion Cotillard]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her portrayal of legendary French singer [[\u00c9dith Piaf]] in ''[[La Vie en Rose (film)|La Vie en Rose]]'', the first French-language performance to be so honored. The film won two Oscars and four [[BAFTA]]s and became the third-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980. Cotillard was the first female and second person to win both an Academy Award and [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for the same performance.\n\nAt the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Entre les murs]]'' (''The Class'') won the [[Palme d'Or]], the 6th French victory at the festival. The 2000s also saw an increase in the number of individual competitive awards won by French artists at the Cannes Festival, for [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|direction]] ([[Tony Gatlif]], ''[[Exils]]'', 2004), [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|screenplay]] ([[Agn\u00e8s Jaoui]] and [[Jean-Pierre Bacri]], ''[[Look at Me (film)|Look at Me]]'', 2004), [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|female acting]] ([[Isabelle Huppert]], ''[[The Piano Teacher (film)|The Piano Teacher]]'', 2001; [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', 2009) and male acting ([[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Samy Naceri]], [[Roschdy Zem]], [[Sami Bouajila]] and [[Bernard Blancan]], ''[[Days of Glory (2006 film)|Days of Glory]]'', 2006).\n\nThe 2008 rural comedy ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'' drew an audience of more than 20 million, the first French film to do so. Its $193 million gross in France puts it just behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' as the most successful film of all time in French theaters.\n\nIn the 2000s, several French directors made international productions, often in the action genre. These include [[G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s]] (''[[Steal (film)|Riders]]'', 2002), [[Pitof]] (''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'', 2004), [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet]] (''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (2005 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'', 2005), [[Florent Emilio Siri]] (''[[Hostage (2005 film)|Hostage]]'', 2005), [[Christophe Gans]] (''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', 2006), [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] (''[[Babylon A.D.]]'', 2008), [[Louis Leterrier]] (''[[The Transporter]]'', 2002; ''[[Transporter 2]]'', 2005; [[Olivier Megaton]] directed ''[[Transporter 3]]'', 2008), [[Alexandre Aja]] (''[[Mirrors (film)|Mirrors]]'', 2008), and [[Pierre Morel]] (''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'', 2009).\n\nSurveying the entire range of French filmmaking today, Tim Palmer calls contemporary cinema in France a kind of eco-system, in which commercial cinema co-exists with artistic radicalism, first-time directors (who make up about 40% of all France's directors each year) mingle with veterans, and there even occasionally emerges a fascinating pop-art hybridity, in which the features of intellectual and mass cinemas are interrelated (as in filmmakers like Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, Olivier Assayas, Ma\u00efwenn, Sophie Filli\u00e8res, Serge Bozon, and others).<ref>Palmer, Tim (2011).

The [[Canal+]] TV channel has a broadcast license requiring it to support the production of movies. Some taxes are levied on movies and TV channels for use as subsidies for movie production. Some tax breaks are given for investment in movie productions, as is common elsewhere [[Movie production incentives in the United States|including in the United States]].

Most prolific in their republican films, after the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], were [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], and, to a lesser degree, [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarus]] and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]].  At the same time, the nation's film industry, which was fully nationalized throughout most of the country's history, was guided by philosophies and laws propounded by the monopoly [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] which introduced a new view on the cinema, [[socialist realism]], which was different from the one before or after the existence of the Soviet Union.\n\n==Historical outline==\nUpon the establishment of the [[Russian Soviet Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Socialist Republic (RSFSR)]] on November 7, 1917 (although the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] did not officially come into existence until December 30, 1922), what had formerly been the [[Russian Empire]] began quickly to come under the domination of a Soviet reorganization of all its institutions.  From the outset, the leaders of this new state held that film would be the most ideal [[propaganda film|propaganda tool]] for the Soviet Union because of its widespread popularity among the established citizenry of the new land. [[Vladimir Lenin]], in fact, reportedly even declared it the most important medium for educating the masses in the ways, means and successes of [[communism]], a position which was later echoed by [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nHowever, between [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the Russian film industry and the infrastructure needed to support it (e.g., electrical power) had deteriorated to the point of unworkability.  The majority of [[movie theater|cinemas]] had been in the corridor between [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], and most were out of commission.  Additionally, many of the performers, producers, directors and other artists of pre-Soviet Russia had fled the country or were moving ahead of [[Red Army]] forces as they pushed further and further south into what remained of the Russian Empire.  Furthermore, the new government did not have the funds to spare for an extensive reworking of the system of filmmaking.  Thus, they initially opted for project approval and censorship guidelines while leaving what remained of the industry in private hands.  As this amounted mostly to cinema houses, the first Soviet films consisted of recycled films of the Russian Empire and its imports, to the extent that these were not determined to be offensive to the new [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet ideology]].  Ironically, the first new film released in Soviet Russia did not exactly fit this mold:  this was ''[[Father Sergius (film)|Father Sergius]]'', a religious film completed during the last weeks of the Russian Empire but not yet exhibited.  It appeared on Soviet screens in 1918.\n\nBeyond this, the government was principally able to fund only short, educational films, the most famous of which were the [[agitki]] \u2013 propaganda films intended to \"agitate\", or energize and enthuse, the masses to participate fully in approved Soviet activities, and deal effectively with those who remained in opposition to the new order.  These short (often one small reel) films were often simple visual aids and accompaniments to live lectures and speeches, and were carried from city to city, town to town, village to village (along with the lecturers) to educate the entire countryside, even reaching areas where film had not been previously seen.\n\nNewsreels, as documentaries, were the other major form of earliest Soviet cinema.  [[Dziga Vertov]]'s newsreel series ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'', the best known of these, lasted from 1922 to 1925 and had a propagandistic bent; Vertov used the series to promote [[socialist realism]] but also to experiment with cinema.\n\nStill, in 1921, there was not one functioning cinema in Moscow until late in the year.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Its rapid success, utilizing old Russian and imported feature films, jumpstarted the industry significantly, especially insofar as the government did not heavily or directly regulate what was shown, and by 1923 an additional 89 cinemas had opened.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Despite extremely high taxation of ticket sales and film rentals, there was an incentive for individuals to begin making feature film product again \u2013 there were places to show the films - albeit they now had to conform their subject matter to a Soviet world view.  In this context, the directors and writers who were in support of the objectives of communism assumed quick dominance in the industry, as they were the ones who could most reliably and convincingly turn out films that would satisfy government censors.\n\n[[File:Ballada2.jpg|thumb|Still from [[Grigori Chukhrai]]'s ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]'' (1959)]]\nNew talent joined the experienced remainder, and an artistic community assembled with the goal of defining \"Soviet film\" as something distinct and better from the output of \"decadent [[capitalism]]\".  The leaders of this community viewed it essential to this goal to be free to experiment with the entire nature of film, a position which would result in several well-known creative efforts but would also result in an unforeseen counter-reaction by the increasingly solidifying administrators of the government-controlled society.\n\n[[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' was released to wide acclaim in 1925; the film was heavily fictionalized and also propagandistic, giving the party line about the virtues of the [[proletariat]].\n\nOne of the most popular films released in the 1930s was ''[[Circus (1936 film)|Circus]]''.  Immediately after the end of the [[Second World War]], [[Color motion picture film|color movies]] such as ''[[The Stone Flower (1946 film)|The Stone Flower]]'' (1946), ''[[Ballad of Siberia]]'' (1947), and ''[[Cossacks of the Kuban]]'' (1949) were released.\nOther notable films from the 1940s include ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' and ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]''.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s Soviet cinema produced ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]'', which won the 1961 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]], and ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]''.\n\n''[[Height (film)|Height]]'' is considered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to be one of the best films of the 1950s (it also became the foundation of the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|bard movement]]).\n\nIn the 1980s there was a diversification of subject matter. Touchy issues could now be discussed openly. The results were films like ''[[Repentance (1987 film)|Repentance]]'',  which dealt with repression in [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], and the allegorical [[science fiction]] movie ''[[Kin-dza-dza!]]''.\n\n==Censorship==\nAfter the [[death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], Soviet filmmakers were given a freer hand to film what they believed audiences wanted to see in their film's characters and stories.  The industry remained a part of the government and any material that was found politically offensive or undesirable, was either removed, edited, reshot, or shelved. The definition of \"socialist realism\" was liberalized to allow development of more human characters, but communism still had to remain uncriticized in its fundamentals.  Additionally, the degree of relative artistic liberality was changed from administration to administration.\n\nExamples created by censorship include:\n\n*The first chapter of the epic film [[Liberation (film series)|''Liberation'']] was filmed 20 years after the subsequent three parts. The film's director, [[Yuri Ozerov (director)|Yuri Ozerov]], had refused to minimize the errors of the [[Stavka|Soviet high command]] during the first year of the war, and instead waited for a time when he could film this portion accurately.\n*Sergei Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible'' Part II was completed in 1945 but was not released until 1958; 5 years after Stalin's death.\n*Eisenstein's ''Alexander Nevsky'' was censored before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] due to its depiction of a strong Russian leader defying an invading army of German [[Teutonic Knights]].  After the invasion, the film was released for propaganda purposes to considerable critical acclaim.\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Rzhevsky.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Yury Yakovlev]] as [[Poruchik Rzhevsky]] in [[Eldar Ryazanov]]'s musical comedy ''[[Hussar Ballad]]'' (1962).]] -->\n\n==Revolution and Civil War==\nThe first Soviet Russian state film organization, the Film Subdepartment of the [[People's Commissariat for Education]], was established in 1917. The work of the nationalized motion-picture studios was administered by the All-Russian Photography and Motion Picture Department, which was recognized in 1923 into [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino]], which in 1926 became Sovkino. The world's first state-filmmaking school, the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|First State School of Cinematography]], was established in Moscow in 1919.\n\nDuring the [[Russian Civil War]], [[agit-train|agitation trains]] and ships visited soldiers, workers, and peasants. Lectures, reports, and political meetings were accompanied by newsreels about events at the various fronts.\n\n==1920s==\nIn the 1920s, the documentary film group headed by [[Dziga Vertov]] blazed the trail from the conventional newsreel to the \"image centered publicistic film\", which became the basis of the Soviet film documentary. Typical of the 1920s were the topical news serial ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'' and the film ''Forward, Soviet!'' by Vertov, whose experiments and achievements in documentary films influenced the development of Russian and world cinematography. Other important films of the 1920s were [[Esfir Shub]]'s historical-revolutionary films such as ''The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty''. The film ''Hydropeat'' by [[Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky]] marked the beginning of popular science films. Feature-length agitation films in 1918-21 were important in the development of the film industry. Innovation in Russian filmmaking was expressed particularly in the work of Eisenstein. ''Battleship Potemkin'' was noteworthy for its innovative montage and metaphorical quality of its film language. It won world acclaim. Eisenstein developed concepts of the revolutionary epic in the film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]''. Also noteworthy was [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s [[Mother (1926 film)|adaptation]] of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[Mother (Gorky novel)|Mother]]'' to the screen in 1926. Pudovkin developed themes of revolutionary history in the film ''[[The End of St. Petersburg]]'' (1927). Other noteworthy silent films were films dealing with contemporary life such as [[Boris Barnet]]'s ''[[The House on Trubnaya]]''. The films of [[Yakov Protazanov]] were devoted to the revolutionary struggle and the shaping of a new way of life, such as ''[[Don Diego and Pelagia]]'' (1928). Ukrainian director [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] was noteworthy for the historical-revolutionary epic ''[[Zvenigora]]'', ''[[Arsenal (1929 film)|Arsenal]]'' and the poetic film ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]''.<ref name=\"GSE\">{{cite web|last = Yakubovich-Yasny|first = Odysseus|script-title=ru:\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|work = [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|publisher = [[Yandex|Yandex.Slovari]]|url = http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00075/36400.htm?text=%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE&encid=bse&stpar1=1.6.1|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-10-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n==1930s==\nIn the early 1930s, Russian filmmakers applied [[socialist realism]] to their work. Among the most outstanding films was ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', a film about Russian revolutionaries and society during the Revolution and Civil War. Revolutionary history was developed in films such as ''[[Golden Mountains (film)|Golden Mountains]]'' by [[Sergei Yutkevich]], ''[[Outskirts (1933 film)|Outskirts]]'' by [[Boris Barnet]], and the Maxim trilogy by [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]]: ''[[The Youth of Maxim]]'', ''[[The Return of Maxim]]'', and ''[[The Vyborg Side]]''. Also notable were biographical films about [[Vladimir Lenin#Film|Vladimir Lenin]] such as [[Mikhail Romm]]'s ''[[Lenin in October]]'' and ''[[Lenin in 1918]]''. The life of Russian society and everyday people were depicted in films such as ''[[Courageous Seven]]'' and ''[[City of Youth]]'' by [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov]]. The comedies of [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] such as ''[[Circus (1936 film)|Circus]]'', ''[[Volga-Volga]]'', and ''[[Tanya (1940 film)|Tanya]]'' as well as ''[[The Rich Bride]]'' by [[Ivan Pyryev]] and ''[[By the Bluest of Seas]]'' by Boris Barnet focus on the psychology of the common person, enthusiasm for work and intolerance for remnants of the past. Many films focused on national heroes, including ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' by [[Sergei Eisenstein]], ''[[Minin and Pozharsky (film)|Minin and Pozharsky]]'' by [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]], and ''[[Bogdan Khmelnitsky (film)|Bogdan Khmelnitsky]]'' by [[Igor Savchenko]]. There were adaptations of literary classics, particularly [[Mark Donskoy]]'s trilogy of films about [[Maxim Gorky]]: ''[[The Childhood of Maxim Gorky]]'', ''[[My Apprenticeship (film)|My Apprenticeship]]'', and ''[[My Universities (film)|My Universities]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s the Stalin wing of the Communist Party consolidated its authority and set about transforming the Soviet Union on both the economic and cultural fronts. The economy moved from the market-based [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) to a system of central planning. The new leadership declared a \"cultural revolution\" in which the party would exercise control over cultural affairs, including artistic expression. Cinema existed at the intersection of art and economics; so it was destined to be thoroughly reorganized in this episode of economic and cultural transformation.\n\nTo implement central planning in cinema, the new entity [[Soyuzkino]] was created in 1930. All the hitherto autonomous studios and distribution networks that had grown up under NEP's market would now be coordinated in their activities by this planning agency. Soyuzkino's authority also extended to the studios of the national republics such as [[VUFKU]], which had enjoyed more independence during the 1920s. Soyuzkino consisted of an extended bureaucracy of economic planners and policy specialists who were charged to formulate annual production plans for the studios and then to monitor the distribution and exhibition of finished films.\n\nWith central planning came more centralized authority over creative decision making. Script development became a long, torturous process under this bureaucratic system, with various committees reviewing drafts and calling for cuts or revisions. In the 1930s censorship became more exacting with each passing year. Feature film projects would drag out for months or years and might be terminated at any point.\n\n[[Alexander Dovzhenko]] drew from Ukrainian folk culture in such films as ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]'' (1930)\nalong the way because of the capricious decision of one or another censoring committee.\nThis redundant oversight slowed down production and inhibited creativity. Although central planning was supposed to increase the film industry's productivity, production levels declined steadily through the 1930s. The industry was releasing over one-hundred features annually at the end of the NEP period, but that figure fell to seventy by 1932 and to forty-five by 1934. It never again reached triple digits during the remainder of the Stalin era. Veteran directors experienced precipitous career declines under this system of control; whereas Eisenstein was able to make four features between 1924 and 1929, he completed only one film, ''Alexander Nevsky'' (1938) during the entire decade of the 1930s. His planned adaptation of the [[Ivan Turgenev]] story ''[[Bezhin Meadow]]'' (1935\u201337) was halted during production in 1937 and officially banned, one of many promising film projects that fell victim to an exacting censorship system.\n\nMeanwhile, the USSR cut off its film contacts with the West. It stopped importing films after 1931 out of concern that foreign films exposed audiences to capitalist ideology. The industry also freed itself from dependency on foreign technologies. During its industrialization effort of the early 1930s, the USSR finally built an array of factories to supply the film industry with the nation's own technical resources.\n\nTo secure independence from the West, industry leaders mandated that the USSR develop its own sound technologies, rather than taking licenses on Western sound systems. Two Soviet scientists, [[Alexander Shorin]] in Leningrad (present-day St. Petersburg) and [[Pavel Tager]] in Moscow, conducted research through the late 1920s on complementary sound systems, which were ready for use by 1930. The implementation process, including the cost of refitting movie theaters, proved daunting, and the USSR did not complete the transition to sound until 1935. Nevertheless, several directors made innovative use of sound once the technology became available. In ''[[Enthusiasm (film)|Enthusiasm: The Symphony of Donbass]]'' (1930), his documentary on coal mining and heavy industry, [[Dziga Vertov]] based his soundtrack on an elegantly orchestrated array of industrial noises. In ''[[The Deserter (1933 film)|The Deserter]]'' (1933) Pudovkin experimented with a form of \"sound counterpoint\" by exploiting tensions and ironic dissonances between sound elements and the image track. And in ''Alexander Nevsky'', Eisenstein collaborated with the composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] on an \"operatic\" film style that elegantly coordinated the musical score and the image track.\n\nAs Soviet cinema made the transition to sound and central planning in the early 1930s, it was also put under a mandate to adopt a uniform film style, commonly identified as \"socialist realism\". In 1932 the party leadership ordered the literary community to abandon the avant-garde practices of the 1920s and to embrace socialist realism, a literary style that, in practice, was actually close to 19th-century realism. The other arts, including cinema, were subsequently instructed to develop the aesthetic equivalent. For cinema, this meant adopting a film style that would be legible to a broad audience, thus avoiding a possible split between the avant-garde and mainstream cinema that was evident in the late 1920s. The director of Soyuzkino and chief policy officer for the film industry, [[Boris Shumyatsky]] (1886\u20131938), who served from 1931 to 1938, was a harsh critic of the montage aesthetic. He championed a \"cinema for the millions\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, which would use clear, linear narration. Although American movies were no longer being imported in the 1930s, the Hollywood model of [[continuity editing]] was readily available, and it had a successful track record with Soviet movie audiences. Soviet socialist realism was built on this style, which assured tidy storytelling. Various guidelines were then added to the doctrine: positive heroes to act as role models for viewers; lessons in good citizenship for spectators to embrace; and support for reigning policy decisions of the Communist Party.\n\nSuch aesthetic policies, enforced by the rigorous censorship apparatus of Soyuzkino, resulted in a number of formulaic films. Apparently, they did succeed in sustaining a true \"cinema of the masses\". The 1930s witnessed some stellar examples of popular cinema. The single most successful film of the decade, in terms of both official praise and genuine affection from the mass audience, was ''[[Chapayev (film)|Chapayev]]'' (1934), directed by the [[Vasilyev brothers]]. Based on the life of a martyred Red Army commander, the film was touted as a model of socialist realism, in that [[Vasily Chapayev|Chapayev]] and his followers battled heroically for the revolutionary cause. The film also humanized the title character, giving him personal foibles, an ironic sense of humour, and a rough peasant charm. These qualities endeared him to the viewing public: spectators reported seeing the film multiple times during its first run in 1934, and ''Chapayev'' was periodically re-released for subsequent generations of audiences.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nA genre that emerged in the 1930s to consistent popular acclaim was the musical comedy, and a master of that form was [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] (1903\u20131984). He effected a creative partnership with his wife, the brilliant comic actress and chanteuse [[Lyubov Orlova]] (1902\u20131975), in a series of crowd-pleasing musicals. Their pastoral comedy ''[[Volga-Volga]]'' (1938) was surpassed only by ''Chapayev'' in terms of box-office success. The fantasy element of their films, with lively musical numbers reviving the montage aesthetic, sometimes stretched the boundaries of socialist realism, but the genre could also allude to contemporary affairs. In Aleksandrov's 1940 musical ''[[Tanya (1940 film)|Tanya]]'', Orlova plays a humble servant girl who rises through the ranks of the Soviet industrial leadership after developing clever labour-saving work methods. Audiences could enjoy the film's comic turn on the ''[[Cinderella]]'' story while also learning about the value of efficiency in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Russia-and-Soviet-Union-THE-CINEMA-OF-STALINISM-1930-1941.html|title=THE CINEMA OF STALINISM: 1930\u20131941|publisher=Advameg, Inc.}}</ref>\n\n==1940s==\nImmediately after the end of the [[Second World War]], [[Color motion picture film|color movies]] such as ''[[The Stone Flower (1946 film)|The Stone Flower]]'' (1946), ''[[Ballad of Siberia]]'' (1947), and ''[[Cossacks of the Kuban]]'' (1949) were released.\nOther notable films from the 1940s include the black and white films, ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'', ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'' and the ''[[Encounter at the Elbe]]''.\n\nThe Soviet film industry suffered during the period after World War II.  On top of dealing with the severe physical and monetary losses of the war, Stalin's regime tightened social control and censorship in order to manage the effects recent exposure to the West had on the people.  The postwar period was marked by an end of almost all autonomy in the Soviet Union.  The ''Catalogue of Soviet Films'' recorded remarkably low numbers of films being produced from 1945 to 1953, with as few as nine films produced in 1951 and a maximum of twenty-three produced in 1952.  These numbers do not, however, include many of the works which are not generally considered to be \"film\" in an elitist sense, such as filmed versions of theatrical works and operas, feature-length event documentaries and travelogues, short films for children, and [[Stereoscopic film|experimental stereoscopic films]].  But compared to the four hundred to five hundred films produced every year by Hollywood, the Soviet film industry was practically dead.\n\nEven as the economy of the Soviet Union strengthened, film production continued to decrease.  A resolution passed by the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] in 1948 further crippled the film industry.  The resolution criticized the work of the industry, saying that an emphasis placed on quantity over quality had ideologically weakened the films.  Instead, the council insisted that every film produced must be a masterpiece for promoting communist ideas and the Soviet system.  Often, Stalin had the ultimate decision on whether a newly produced film was appropriate for public viewing.  In private screenings after meetings of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], the Minister of the Film Industry {{ill|Ivan Bolshakov|ru|\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} privately screened films for Stalin and top members of Soviet government. The strict limitations on content and complex, centralized process for approval drove many screenwriters away, and studios had much difficulty producing any of the quality films mandated by the 1948 resolution.<ref>Peter Kenez, ''Cinema and Soviet Society: From the Revolution to the Death of Stalin'' (London: I.B. Tauris & Co Ltd., 2001), 187\u2013191.</ref>\n\n===Trophy films===\nMovie theaters in the postwar period faced the problem of satisfying the growing appetites of Soviet audiences for films while dealing with the shortage of newly produced works from studios.  In response, cinemas played the same films for months at a time, many of them the works of the late 1930s.  Anything new drew millions of people to the box office, and many theaters screened foreign films to attract larger audiences.  Most of these foreign films were \"trophy films\", two thousand films brought into the country by the [[Red Army]] after the [[Military occupations by the Soviet Union|occupation]] of Germany and Eastern Europe in World War II.<ref>Peter Kenez, ''Cinema'', 191-192.</ref>   In the top secret minutes for the [[CPSU Central Committee|CPSU Committee]] Meeting on August 31, 1948, the committee permitted the Minister of the Film Industry to release fifty of these films in the Soviet Union.  Of these fifty, Bolshakov was only allowed to release twenty-four for screening to the general public, mainly films made in Germany, Austria, Italy, and France.  The other twenty-six films, consisting almost entirely of American films, were only allowed to be shown in private screenings.  The minutes also include a separate list of permitted German musical films, which were mainly German and Italian film adaptations of famous operas.<ref>Richard Taylor, ''Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany'' (New York: I.B.Tauris, 1998), 212-214.</ref>   Most of the trophy films were released in 1948\u201349, but somewhat strangely, compiled lists of the released films include ones not previously mentioned in the official minutes of the Central Committee.<ref>M. Turovskaia et al. (eds), ''Kino totalitarnoi epokhi'' (1933-1945) (Moscow, 1989), 45-46, quoted in Taylor, ''Film Propaganda'', 238.</ref>\n\nThe public release of these trophy films seems contradictory in the context of the 1940s Soviet Union.  The Soviet government allowed the exhibition of foreign films which contained far more subversive ideas than any a Soviet director would have ever attempted putting in a film at a time when Soviet artists found themselves unemployed because of censorship laws.  Historians hypothesize many possible reasons why the Soviet government showed such seemingly inexplicable leniency toward the foreign films.  The government may have granted cinemas the right to show the films so they could stay in business after the domestic film industry had declined.  A second hypothesis speculates that the government saw the films as an easy source of money to help rebuild the nation after the war.<ref>Kenez, Cinema, 191-192.</ref>   The minutes of the CPSU Central Committee meeting seem to support the latter idea with instructions that the films are to bring in a net income of at least 750 million rubles to the State coffers over the course of a year from public and private screenings, and 250 million rubles of this were supposed to come from rentals to the trade union camera network.<ref>Taylor, ''Film Propaganda'', 213.</ref>\n\nIn addition to releasing the films, the committee also charged Bolshakov and the Agitation and Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee \"with making the necessary editorial corrections to the films and with providing an introductory text and carefully edited subtitles for each film.\"<ref>Quoted in Taylor, ''Film Propaganda'', 212.</ref>   In general, the captured [[Nazism and cinema|Nazi films]] were considered apolitical enough to be shown to the general populace.  Still the Propaganda and Agitation Section of the Central Committee ran into trouble with the censoring of two films slated for release.  The censors found it impossible to remove the \"[[Zionism|Zionist]]\" ideas from [[Jud Suss (1940 film)|''Jud Suss'']], an anti-Semitic, Nazi propaganda film.  The censors also had trouble with a film adaptation of [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|''Of Mice and Men'']] because of the representation of the poor as a detriment to society.\n\nThere is very little direct evidence of how Soviet audiences received the trophy films.  Soviet magazines or newspapers never reviewed the films, there were no audience surveys, and no records exist of how many people viewed the films.  In order to judge the reception and popularity of these foreign films, historians have mainly relied on anecdotal evidence.  The German musical comedy ''[[The Woman of My Dreams (1944 film)|The Woman of My Dreams]]'' has received mixed reviews according to this evidence. ''{{ill|Kultura i Zhizn|ru|\u041a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c}}'' published a supposed survey compiled of readers' letters to the editor in March, 1947 which criticize the film for being idealess, low brow, and even harmful.  [[Bulat Okudzhava]] wrote a contradicting viewpoint in ''Druzhba narodov'' in 1986, saying that everyone in the city of [[Tbilisi]] was crazy about the film.  According to him, everywhere he went people were talking about the film and whistling the songs.  Of the two accounts, film historians generally consider Okudzhava's more reliable than the one presented by ''Kultura i Zhizn''.  Films such as ''[[His Butler's Sister]]'', ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'', ''[[Waterloo Bridge (1940 film)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' and ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'', although not technically trophies as they had been purchased legally during the wartime alliance with America, were highly popular with Soviet audiences.  In [[Vechernyaya Moskva|''Vecherniaia Moskva'']] (October 4, 1946), M. Chistiakov reprimanded theaters and the Soviet film industry for the fact that over a six-month timespan, sixty of the films shown had been tasteless Western films rather than Soviet ones.  Even in criticism of the films and the crusading efforts of the [[Rootless cosmopolitan|anti-cosmopolitan campaign]] against the trophy films, it is clear to see they had quite an impact on Soviet society.<ref>Kenez, ''Cinema'', 192-193.</ref>\n\n==1950s==\nWith the start of the [[Cold War]], writers, still considered the primary [[auteurs]], were all the more reluctant to take up script writing, and the early 1950s saw only a handful of feature films completed during any year.  The death of Stalin was a relief to some people, and all the more so was the official trashing of his public image as a benign and competent leader by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] two years later.  This latter event gave filmmakers the margin of comfort they needed to move away from the narrow stories of socialist realism, expand its boundaries, and begin work on a wider range of entertaining and artistic Soviet films.\n\nNotable films include:\n*''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', directed at Mosfilm by the Georgian-born director [[Mikhail Kalatozov]] in 1957. It won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1958 Cannes Film Festival]].\n*''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]'', directed at Mosfilm by [[Grigori Chukhrai]] in 1959.  It won [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]] Special Jury Prize as well as [[15th British Academy Film Awards|1961 BAFTA Award]] for Best Film from any Source along with many other awards.  It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] ([[34th Academy Awards|1961]]).\n\n==1960s\u201370s==\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw the creation of many films, many of which molded Soviet and post-Soviet culture. They include:\n* ''[[Five Days, Five Nights (1960 film)|Five Days, Five Nights]]'' (1960), the first of the joint Soviet-German films\n*''[[Walking the Streets of Moscow]]'' (1963)\n*''[[Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures]]'' (1965) and its sequel, ''[[Kidnapping, Caucasian Style]]'' (1966)\n*''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'' (1966\u201367) [[Sergei Bondarchuk]]'s adaption of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s [[War and Peace|novel]], with a budget of 8.5 million rubles, a running time of seven hours, and utilizing thousands of extras. It was the first Russian film to receive an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n*''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966) won various international awards, such as [[FIPRESCI]].\n*''[[The Diamond Arm]]'' (1968), the last four comedies, especially ''Diamond Arm'', have contributed a lot of humorous quotes.\n*''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'' (1969) had a limited release inside the Soviet Union and wasn't seen abroad until years later, but has received critical acclaim since.\n*''[[White Sun of the Desert]]'' (1970), a classic \"[[Ostern|Eastern]]\", although with dubious stereotyping of central Asians. It is ritually watched by [[cosmonaut]]s before launches, and has contributed many quotes to the Russian language such as 'The East is a delicate matter'. Its theme tune became a huge hit.\n*''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Gentlemen of Fortune]]'' (1972) starring [[Yevgeny Leonov]]\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Batalov.jpg|right|frame|[[Aleksey Batalov]] as Gosha in ''[[Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears]]''.]] -->\n*''[[The Irony of Fate|The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Office Romance]]'' (1977)\n*''[[Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears]]'' (1979) won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1980.\nSoviet films tend to be rather culture-specific and are difficult for many foreigners to understand without having been exposed to the culture first. Various Soviet directors were more concerned with artistic success than with economical success (They were paid by the academy, and so money was not a critical issue). This contributed to the creation of a large number of more philosophical and poetical films. Most well-known examples of such films are those by directors [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], [[Sergei Parajanov]] and [[Nikita Mikhalkov]]. In keeping with Russian culture, tragi-comedies were very popular. These decades were also prominent in the production of the [[Ostern|Eastern]] or Red Western.\n\n[[History of Russian animation|Animation]] was a respected genre, with many directors experimenting with technique. ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (1979) by [[Yuriy Norshteyn]] was twice given the title of \"Best Animated Film of All Eras and Nations\" by animation professionals from around the world, in 1984 and 2002.\n\nIn the year of the 60th anniversary of the Soviet cinema (1979), on April 25, a decision of the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] established a commemorative \"{{ill|Russian Cinema Day|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|lt=Soviet Cinema Day}}\". It was then celebrated in the USSR each year on August 27, the day on which [[Vladimir Lenin]] signed a decree to [[nationalization|nationalise]] the country's cinematic and photographic industries.\n\n==1980s==\nThe policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] saw a loosening of the censorship of earlier eras.<ref>Butenko, I.

Since the development of the Italian film industry in the early 1900s, Italian filmmakers and performers have, at times, experienced both domestic and international success, and have influenced film movements throughout the world.  As of 2017, Italian films have won 14 [[List of countries by number of Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], the most of any country, as well as 12 [[Palme d'Or|Palmes d'Or]], the second-most of any country.\n\nEarly Italian films were typically adaptations of books or stage plays.  By the 1910s, Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs, lavish costumes, and record budgets, to produce pioneering films such as [[Enrico Guazzoni]]'s ''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1913) and [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914).  One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements, [[Italian Futurism (cinema)|Italian Futurism]], took place in Italy in the late 1910s.  After a period of decline in the 1920s, the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of [[sound film]].  A popular Italian genre during this period, the ''[[Telefoni Bianchi]]'', consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds.<ref name=katz>Katz, Ephraim, \"Italy,\" ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (New York: HarperResource, 2001), pp. 682-685.</ref>\n\nWhile Italy's [[National Fascist Party|Fascist government]] provided financial support for the nation's film industry, most notably the construction of the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios (the largest film studio in Europe), it also engaged in censorship, and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films.  Post-World War II Italy saw the rise of the influential [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] movement, which launched the directorial careers of [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], and [[Vittorio De Sica]].  Neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favor of lighter films, such as those of the ''[[Commedia all'italiana]]'' genre and important directors like [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]].  Actresses such as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Giulietta Masina]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] achieved international stardom during this period.<ref name=katz />\n\nThe [[Spaghetti Western]] achieved popularity in the mid-1960s, peaking with [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'', which featured enigmatic [[film score|scores]] by composer [[Ennio Morricone]].  Erotic Italian thrillers, or ''[[giallo]]s'', produced by directors such as [[Mario Bava]] and [[Dario Argento]] in the 1970s, influenced the horror genre worldwide.  During the 1980s and 1990s, directors such as [[Ermanno Olmi]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Giuseppe Tornatore]], [[Gabriele Salvatores]] and [[Roberto Benigni]] brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema.<ref name=katz />\n\nThe country is also famed for its prestigious [[Venice Film Festival]], the oldest film festival in the world, held annually since 1932 and awarding the [[Golden Lion]].<ref>{{cite web| title = La Biennale di Venezia \u2013 The origin | url = http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/history/origin.html?back=true | accessdate = 9 September 2018 }}</ref> In [[65th Venice International Film Festival|2008]] the Venice Days (\"Giornate degli Autori\"), a section held in parallel to the Venice Film Festival, has produced in collaboration with Cinecitt\u00e0 studios and the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Ministry of Cultural Heritage]] a list of 100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978, the \"[[100 film italiani da salvare|100 Italian films to be saved]]\".\n\n==Early years==\n{{See also|Italian Futurism (cinema)}}\nThe French [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] commenced public screenings in Italy in 1896: in March 1896, in Rome and Milan; in April in Naples, Salerno and Bari; in June in Livorno; in August in Bergamo, Bologna and Ravenna; in October in Ancona;<ref>Angelini, F.

Lumi\u00e8re trainees produced short films documenting everyday life and comic strips in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Pioneering Italian cinematographer [[Filoteo Alberini]] patented his \"Kinetograph\" during this period.<ref name=katz />\n[[File:L'Inferno 1911 film.jpg|thumb|190px|''[[L'Inferno]]'' (1911) the first full-length Italian feature film ever made]]\nThe Italian film industry took shape between 1903 and 1908, led by three major organizations: [[Cines]], based in Rome; and the Turin-based companies [[Ambrosio Film]] and [[Itala Film]]. Other companies soon followed in Milan and Naples, and these early companies quickly attained a respectable production quality and were able to market their products both within Italy and abroad.\n\nEarly Italian films typically consisted of adaptations of books or stage plays, such as [[Mario Caserini]]'s ''[[Otello (1906 film)|Otello]]'' (1906) and [[Arturo Ambrosio]]'s 1908 adaptation of the novel, ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]''.  Also popular during this period were films about historical figures, such as Caserini's ''Beatrice Cenci'' (1909) and [[Ugo Falena]]'s ''Lucrezia Borgia'' (1910). ''[[L'Inferno]]'', produced by [[Milano Films]] in 1911, was the first full-length Italian [[feature film]] ever made.<ref name=\"Welle\">{{cite book |last=Welle |first=John P. |authorlink= |editor-last=Iannucci |editor-first=Amilcare A. |contribution=Early Cinima, Dante's Inferno of 1911, and the Origins of Italian Film Culture |title=Dante, Cinema, and Television |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2004 |pages=36, 38\u201340 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oYFJXwbi9sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-8020-8827-9}}</ref> Popular early Italian actors included [[Emilio Ghione]], [[Alberto Collo]], [[Bartolomeo Pagano]], [[Amleto Novelli]], [[Lyda Borelli]], [[Ida Carloni Talli]], [[Lidia Quaranta]] and [[Maria Jacobini]].<ref name=katz />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n\n | image1 = Quo Vadis poster.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = ''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1913), regarded as the first blockbuster in the history of cinema\n\n | image2 = Cabiria poster.jpg\n | alt 2= \n | caption2 = ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914), the first [[epic film]] ever made\n}}\n\nEnrico Guazzone's 1913 film ''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' was one of the earliest \"[[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]\" in cinema history, utilizing thousands of [[extra (acting)|extras]] and a lavish set design.  [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s 1914 film ''[[Cabiria]]'' was an even larger production, requiring two years and a record budget to produce, and it was the first [[epic film]] ever made. [[Nino Martoglio]]'s ''Lost in Darkness'', also produced in 1914, documented life in the slums of [[Naples]], and is considered a precursor to the [[Italian neorealism|Neorealist]] movement of the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=katz />\n\n[[File:Thais Bragaglia 1917 02.jpg|170px|thumb|''[[Tha\u00efs (Italian film)|Tha\u00efs]]'' (1917)]]\n\nBetween 1911 and 1919, Italy was home to the first avant-garde movement in cinema, inspired by the country's [[Futurism]] movement. The 1916 Manifesto of Futuristic Cinematography was signed by [[Filippo Marinetti]], Armando Ginna, Bruno Corra, [[Giacomo Balla]] and others. To the Futurists, cinema was an ideal art form, being a fresh medium, and able to be manipulated by speed, special effects and editing. Most of the futuristic-themed films of this period have been lost, but critics cite ''[[Tha\u00efs (Italian film)|Tha\u00efs]]'' (1917) by [[Anton Giulio Bragaglia]] as one of the most influential, serving as the main inspiration for [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist cinema]] in the following decade.\n\nThe Italian film industry struggled against rising foreign competition in the years following [[World War I]].<ref name=katz />  Several major studios, among them Cines and Ambrosio, formed the Unione Cinematografica Italiana to coordinate a national strategy for film production.  This effort was largely unsuccessful, however, due to a wide disconnect between production and exhibition (some movies weren't released until several years after they were produced).<ref>Steve Ricci, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tuq7FNacGvgC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4 Cinema and Fascism: Italian Film and Society, 1922-1943]'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 4.</ref>  Among the notable Italian films of the late silent era were [[Mario Camerini]]'s ''Rotaio'' (1929) and [[Alessandro Blasetti]]'s ''[[Sun (film)|Sun]]'' (1929).<ref name=katz />\n\n==Cinecitt\u00e0==\n[[File:Cinecitt\u00e0 - Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios]]\nIn 1930, [[Gennaro Righelli]] directed the first Italian [[sound film]], ''[[The Song of Love (film)|The Song of Love]]''.  This was followed by Blasetti's ''[[Mother Earth (film)|Mother Earth]]'' (1930) and ''[[Resurrection (1931 Italian film)|Resurrection]]'' (1931), and Camerini's ''Figaro and His Great Day'' (1931). The advent of sound film led to stricter censorship from the [[National Fascist Party|Fascist government]].<ref name=katz />\n\nDuring the 1930s, light comedies known as \"[[Telefoni Bianchi]]\" (\"white telephone\") were predominant in Italian cinema.<ref name=katz />  These films, which featured lavish set designs, promoted conservative values and respect for authority, and thus typically avoided the scrutiny of government censors.  Important examples of ''Telefoni Bianchi'' include [[Guido Brignone]]'s ''Paradiso'' (1932), [[Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia|Carlo Bragaglia]]'s ''O la borsa o la vita'' (1933), and Righelli's ''Together in the Dark'' (1935).  Historical films such as Blasetti's ''[[1860 (film)|1860]]'' (1934) and [[Carmine Gallone]]'s ''[[Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal]]'' (1937) were also popular during this period.<ref name=katz />\n\nIn 1934, the Italian government created the General Directorate for Cinema (''Direzione Generale per le Cinematografia''), and appointed [[Luigi Freddi]] its director.  With the approval of [[Benito Mussolini]], this directorate called for the establishment of a town southeast of Rome devoted exclusively to cinema, dubbed the \"Cinecitt\u00e0\" (\"Cinema City\"). Completed in 1937, the Cinecitt\u00e0 provided everything necessary for filmmaking: theaters, technical services, and even a cinematography school, the [[Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia]], for younger apprentices.  The Cinecitt\u00e0 studios were Europe's most advanced production facilities, and greatly boosted the technical quality of Italian films.<ref name=katz />  Many films are still shot entirely in Cinecitt\u00e0.\n\nDuring this period, Mussolini's son, [[Vittorio Mussolini|Vittorio]], created a national production company and organized the work of noted authors, directors and actors (including even some political opponents), thereby creating an interesting communication network among them, which produced several noted friendships and stimulated cultural interaction.\n\n==Neorealism==\n{{Main|Italian neorealism}}\n\n[[File:ROMA C~1.JPG|thumb|A still shot from ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' (1945), by [[Roberto Rossellini]].]]\nBy the end of [[World War II]], the Italian \"neorealist\" movement had begun to take shape.  Neorealist films typically dealt with the working class (in contrast to the ''Telefoni Bianchi''), and were shot on location.  Many neorealist films, but not all, utilized non-professional actors. Though the term \"neorealism\" was used for the first time to describe [[Luchino Visconti]]\u2019s 1943 film, ''[[Ossessione]]'', there were several important precursors to the movement, most notably Camerini's ''[[What Scoundrels Men Are!]]'' (1932), which was the first Italian film shot entirely on location, and Blasetti's 1942 film, ''[[Four Steps in the Clouds]]''.<ref name=bergan>Ronald Bergan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=f8YeCNSBiOcC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=italian+neorealism+blasetti+four+steps&source=bl&ots=LeRKxCQUIg&sig=y5NDB4Qrd7-UJbjlPfLdSq_yCFw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JJrEUei4N4bM9gT66oCYCQ&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=italian%20neorealism%20blasetti%20four%20steps&f=false The Film Book]'' (Penguin, 2011), p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[File:LadriDiBicicletteStaiola1948.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), by [[Vittorio De Sica]], ranked among the best movies ever made.]]\n\n''Ossessione'' angered Fascist officials.  Upon viewing the film, Vittorio Mussolini is reported to have shouted, \"This is not Italy!\" before walking out of the theater.<ref>Ricci, ''Cinema and Fascism'', p. 169.</ref>  The film was subsequently banned in the Fascist-controlled parts of Italy.  While neorealism exploded after the war, and was incredibly influential at the international level, neorealist films made up only a small percentage of Italian films produced during this period, as postwar Italian moviegoers preferred escapist comedies starring actors such as [[Toto (actor)|Tot\u00f2]] and [[Alberto Sordi]].<ref name=bergan />\n\nNeorealist works such as [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s trilogy ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' (1945), ''[[Paisan|Pais\u00e0]]'' (1946), and ''[[Germany, Year Zero]]'' (1948), with professional actors such as [[Anna Magnani]] and a number of non-professional actors, attempted to describe the difficult economic and moral conditions of postwar Italy and the changes in public mentality in everyday life.  Visconti's ''[[La Terra Trema|The Earth Trembles]]'' (1948) was shot on location in a Sicilian fishing village, and utilized local non-professional actors. [[Giuseppe De Santis]], on other hand, used actors such as [[Silvana Mangano]] and [[Vittorio Gassman]] in his 1949 film, ''[[Bitter Rice]]'', which is set in the [[Po Valley]] during rice-harvesting season.\n\nPoetry and cruelty of life were harmonically combined in the works that [[Vittorio De Sica]] wrote and directed together with screenwriter [[Cesare Zavattini]]: among them, ''[[Shoeshine (film)|Shoeshine]]'' (1946), ''[[Bicycle Thieves|The Bicycle Thief]]'' (1948) and ''[[Miracle in Milan]]'' (1951). The 1952 film ''[[Umberto D.]]'' showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece and one of the most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.\n\nAlthough ''Umberto D.'' is considered the end of the neorealist period, later films such as [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954) and De Sica's 1960 film ''[[Two Women]]'' (for which [[Sophia Loren]] won the Oscar for Best Actress) are grouped with the genre.  Director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s first film, ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961), shows a strong neorealist influence.<ref name=bergan />  Italian neorealist cinema influenced filmmakers around the world, and helped inspire other film movements, such as the [[French New Wave]] and the [[Polish Film School]]. The Neorealist period is often simply referred to as \"The Golden Age\" of Italian Cinema by critics, filmmakers, and scholars.\n\n==Pink neorealism and comedy==\n[[File:Mastroianni ottomez.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marcello Mastroianni]] in ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1963) by [[Federico Fellini]], considered to be one of the greatest films of all time]]\nIt has been said that after ''Umberto D.'' nothing more could be added to neorealism. Possibly because of this, neorealism effectively ended with that film; subsequent works turned toward lighter atmospheres, perhaps more coherent with the improving conditions of the country, and this genre has been called ''pink neorealism''. This trend allowed better-\"equipped\" actresses to become real celebrities, such as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Silvana Pampanini]], [[Lucia Bos\u00e9]], [[Barbara Bouchet]], [[Eleonora Rossi Drago]], [[Silvana Mangano]], [[Virna Lisi]], [[Claudia Cardinale]] and [[Stefania Sandrelli]]. Soon pink neorealism, such as ''[[Pane, amore e gelosia]]'' (1954, released in the US as ''Frisky'') with [[Vittorio DeSica]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]], was replaced by the ''[[Commedia all'italiana]]'', a unique genre that, born on an ideally humouristic line, talked instead very seriously about important social themes.\n\n[[File:Fermo con le mani !.png|thumb|[[Tot\u00f2]] in his first movie ''[[Hands Off Me!]]'' (1937)]]\n\nAt this time, on the more commercial side of production, the phenomenon of [[Tot\u00f2]], a Neapolitan actor who is acclaimed as the major Italian comic, exploded.  His films (often with [[Peppino De Filippo]] and almost always with [[Mario Castellani]]) expressed a sort of neorealistic satire, in the means of a ''guitto'' (a \"hammy\" actor) as well as with the art of the great dramatic actor he also was. A \"film-machine\" who produced dozens of titles per year, his repertoire was frequently repeated. His personal story (a prince born in the poorest ''rione'' (section of the city) of [[Naples]]), his unique twisted face, his special mimic expressions and his gestures created an inimitable personage and made him one of the most beloved Italians of the 1960s.\n\nItalian Comedy is generally considered to have started with [[Mario Monicelli]]'s ''I soliti Ignoti'' (''[[Big Deal on Madonna Street]]'', 1958) and derives its name from the title of [[Pietro Germi]]'s ''Divorzio all'Italiana'' (''[[Divorce Italian Style]]'', 1961). For a long time this definition was used with a derogatory intention.\n\n[[Vittorio Gassman]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Ugo Tognazzi]], [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], [[Monica Vitti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]] were among the stars of these movies, that described the years of the economical reprise and investigated Italian customs, a sort of self-ethnological research.\n\nIn 1961 [[Dino Risi]] directed ''Una vita difficile'' (''[[A Difficult Life]]''), then ''[[The Easy Life|Il sorpasso]]'' (The Easy Life), now a cult-movie, followed by: ''[[I Mostri]]'' (''The Monsters'', also known as ''15 From Rome''), ''In nome del Popolo Italiano'' (''In the Name of the Italian People'') and ''[[Profumo di donna]]'' (''Scent of a Woman'').\n\nMonicelli's works include ''La grande guerra'' (''[[The Great War (1959 film)|The Great War]]''), ''I compagni'' (''Comrades'', also known as ''[[The Organizer]]''), ''[[L'Armata Brancaleone]]'', ''[[Vogliamo i colonnelli]]'' (''We Want the Colonels''), ''Romanzo popolare'' (Popular Novel) and the ''[[Amici miei]]'' series.\n\nA series of black-and-white films based on [[Don Camillo]] character created by the Italian writer and journalist [[Giovannino Guareschi]] were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions, and starred [[Fernandel]] as Don Camillo and [[Gino Cervi]] as Peppone. The titles are: ''[[The Little World of Don Camillo]]'', ''[[The Return of Don Camillo]]'', ''[[Don Camillo's Last Round]]'', ''[[Don Camillo: Monsignor]]'', and ''[[Don Camillo in Moscow]]''. [[Mario Camerini]] began filming the film ''Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi'' but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death.  The film was then completed in 1972 with [[Gastone Moschin]] playing the role of Don Camillo and [[Lionel Stander]] as Peppone. A Don Camillo (''[[The World of Don Camillo]]'') film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with [[Terence Hill]] directing and also starring as Don Camillo. [[Colin Blakely]] performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.\n\n==Hollywood on the Tiber==\n{{Main|Hollywood on the Tiber}}\n[[File:Cuadrigas de Ben Hur (1959).jpg|thumb|300px|American film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959) was shot at the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios and on location around Rome during the \"[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]\" era.]]\nIn the late 1940s, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studios began to shift production abroad to Europe. Italy was, along with Britain, one of the major destinations for American film companies. Shooting at Cinecitt\u00e0, large-budget films such as ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951), ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) were made in [[English language|English]] with international casts and sometimes, but not always, Italian settings or themes. The heyday of what was dubbed '\"Hollywood on the Tiber\" was between 1950 and 1970, during which time many of the most famous names in world cinema made films in Italy.\n\n==Peplum (a.k.a. Sword and Sandal)==\n{{Main|Peplum film genre}}\nWith the release of 1958's ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', starring American bodybuilder [[Steve Reeves]], the Italian film industry gained entree to the [[United States|American]] film market.  These films, many with mythological or Bible themes, were low-budget costume/adventure dramas, and had immediate appeal with both European and American audiences.  Besides the many films starring a variety of muscle men as Hercules, heroes such as [[Samson]] and Italian fictional hero [[Maciste]] were common. Sometimes dismissed as low-quality escapist fare, the Peplums allowed newer directors such as [[Sergio Leone]] and [[Mario Bava]] a means of breaking into the film industry. Some, such as Mario Bava's ''[[Hercules in the Haunted World]]'' (Italian: Ercole Al Centro Della Terra) are considered seminal works in their own right. As the genre matured, budgets sometimes increased, as evidenced in 1962's ''[[I sette gladiatori]]'' (''The Seven Gladiators'' in 1964 US release), a wide-screen epic with impressive sets and matte-painting work. Most Peplum films were in [[Color motion picture film|color]], whereas previous Italian efforts had often been black and white.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"165px\">\nFile:Bartolomeo Pagano - Maciste.JPG|[[Bartolomeo Pagano]] as [[Maciste]]\nFile:Douglas Mangano.jpg|[[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Silvana Mangano]] in a pause during the shootings of ''[[Ulysses (1954 film)|Ulysses]]'' (1954)\nFile:Steve Reeves e Gordon Scott in Romolo e Remo.jpg|''[[Duel of the Titans]]'' (1961)\nFile:Arrivano i titani (film).JPG| ''[[My Son, the Hero]]'' (1962)\n</gallery>\n\n==The Spaghetti Western==\n{{Main|Spaghetti Western}}\nOn the heels of the [[Peplum film genre|Peplum]] craze, a related genre, the [[Spaghetti Western]] arose and was popular both in Italy and elsewhere.  These films differed from traditional [[Western (genre)|western]]s by being filmed in Europe on limited budgets, but featured vivid cinematography.\n\nThe most popular Spaghetti Westerns were those of [[Sergio Leone]], whose [[Dollars Trilogy]] (''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]''), featuring [[Clint Eastwood]] and scores by [[Ennio Morricone]], came to define the genre along with ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''.\n\nAlso considered Spaghetti Westerns is a film genre which combined traditional western ambiance with a [[Commedia all'italiana]]-type comedy; films including ''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' and ''[[Trinity Is STILL My Name!]]'', which featured [[Bud Spencer]] and [[Terence Hill]], the stage names of [[Carlo Pedersoli]] and [[Mario Girotti]].\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"165px\">\nFile:Clint Eastwood1.png|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the [[Man with No Name]] in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', the first film of [[Sergio Leone]]'s \"[[Dollar Trilogy]]\"\nFile:Franco Nero (Django).jpg|[[Franco Nero]] as [[Django (character)|Django]] in the [[Django (1966 film)|film of the same name]]\nFile:Lo chiamavano Trinit\u00e0.png|[[Bud Spencer]] and [[Terence Hill]] in ''[[They Call Me Trinity]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Auteurs==\nItaly has produced many important cinematography ''[[auteur]]s'', including [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Ettore Scola]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Luigi Comencini]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Franco Zeffirelli]], [[Valerio Zurlini]], [[Florestano Vancini]], [[Mario Monicelli]], [[Marco Ferreri]], [[Elio Petri]], [[Dino Risi]] and [[Mauro Bolognini]]. These directors' works often span many decades and genres. Present ''auteurs'' include [[Giuseppe Tornatore]], [[Marco Bellocchio]], [[Ermanno Olmi]], [[Nanni Moretti]], [[Gabriele Salvatores]], [[Gianni Amelio]], [[Dario Argento]] and [[Paolo Sorrentino]].\n\n==Sophia Loren's Academy Award==\n[[File:La ciociara, screenshot.gif|thumb|[[Sophia Loren]] and [[Eleonora Brown]] in ''[[Two Women]]'' (1960)]]\nIn 1961 [[Sophia Loren]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role as a woman who is raped in [[World War II]], along with her adolescent daughter, in [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Two Women]]''. She was the first actress to win an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for a performance in any foreign language, and the second Italian leading lady Oscar-winner (after [[Anna Magnani]]).\n\n==Giallo (Thriller/Horror)==\n{{main article|Giallo}}\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, Italian filmmakers [[Mario Bava]], [[Riccardo Freda]], [[Antonio Margheriti]] and [[Dario Argento]] developed ''[[giallo]]'' horror films that become classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'', ''[[Castle of Blood]]'', ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'', ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'', ''[[Deep Red]]'' and ''[[Suspiria]].''\n\nDue to the success of the [[James Bond]] film series the Italian film industry made large amounts of imitations and spoofs in the [[Eurospy]] genre from 1964-1967.\n\nFollowing the 1960s boom of shockumentary \"[[Mondo films]]\" such as [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]]'s ''[[Mondo Cane]]'', during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Italian cinema became internationally synonymous with violent horror films. These films were primarily produced for the [[video]] market and were credited with fueling the \"[[video nasty]]\" era in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nDirectors in this genre included [[Lucio Fulci]], [[Joe D'Amato]], [[Umberto Lenzi]] and [[Ruggero Deodato]]. Some of their films faced legal challenges in the [[United Kingdom]]; after the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act of 1984]], it became a legal offense to sell a copy of such films as ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' and ''[[SS Experiment Camp]]''. Italian films of this period are usually grouped together as [[exploitation film]]s.\n\nSeveral countries charged Italian studios with exceeding the boundaries of acceptability with their late-1970s [[Nazi exploitation]] films, inspired by American movies such as ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]''. The Italian works included the notorious but comparatively tame ''SS Experiment Camp'' and the far more graphic ''[[Last Orgy of the Third Reich]]'' (Italian: L'ultima orgia del III Reich). These films showed, in great detail, sexual crimes against prisoners at concentration camps. These films may still be banned in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"165px\">\nFile:La Maschera del Demonio.png|[[Barbara Steele]] in ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'' (1960)\nFile:Sei donne per l'assassino.png|A scene from ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964)\nFile:Profondo rosso Calandra.jpg|[[Giuliana Calandra]] in a famous scene from ''[[Deep Red]]'' (1975)\nFile:Suspiria 1977.jpg|Suzy ([[Jessica Harper]]) and Sara ([[Stefania Casini]]) in ''[[Suspiria]]'', the first film in [[Dario Argento]]'s \"[[The Three Mothers]]\" trilogy\n</gallery>\n\n==Poliziotteschi==\n{{Main|Poliziotteschi}}\n[[File:Fernando Di Leo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fernando Di Leo]]]]\n'''Poliziotteschi''' ({{IPA-it|polittsjot\u02c8teski}}; plural of '''''poliziottesco''''') films constitute a subgenre of crime and [[action film]] that emerged in [[Italy]] in the late 1960s and reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s. They are also known as polizieschi, Italo-crime, Euro-crime or simply Italian crime films. Most notable international actors acted in this genre of films such [[Alain Delon]], [[Henry Silva]], [[Fred Williamson]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Tomas Milian]] and others international stars.\n\n==The 1980s crisis==\nBetween the late 1970s and mid 1980s, Italian cinema was in crisis; \"art films\" became increasingly isolated, separating from the mainstream Italian cinema.\n\nAmong the major artistic films of this era were ''[[La citt\u00e0 delle donne]]'', ''[[E la nave va]]'', ''[[Ginger and Fred]]'' by [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], ''[[L'albero degli zoccoli]]'' by [[Ermanno Olmi]] (winner of the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]), ''[[La notte di San Lorenzo]]'' by [[Paolo and Vittorio Taviani]], Antonioni's ''Identificazione di una donna'', and ''[[Bianca (1984 film)|Bianca]]'' and ''[[La messa \u00e8 finita]]'' by [[Nanni Moretti]]. Although not entirely Italian, Bertolucci's ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', winner of 9 Oscars, and ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' of Sergio Leone came out of this period also.\n\nDuring this time, [[commedia sexy all'italiana]] films, described as \"trash films\", were popular in Italy. These comedy films were of little artistic value and reached their popularity by confronting Italian social taboos, most notably in the sexual sphere. Actors such as [[Lino Banfi]], [[Diego Abatantuono]], [[Alvaro Vitali]], [[Gloria Guida]], [[Barbara Bouchet]] and [[Edwige Fenech]] owe much of their popularity to these films.\n\nAlso considered part of the trash genre are films which feature [[Ugo Fantozzi|Fantozzi]], a comic personage invented by [[Paolo Villaggio]]. Although Villaggio's movies tend to bridge trash comedy with a more elevated social satire; this character had a great impact on Italian society, to such a degree that the adjective ''fantozziano'' entered the lexicon. Of the many films telling of Fantozzi's misadventures, the most notable were ''[[Fantozzi (film)|Fantozzi]]'' and ''[[Il secondo tragico Fantozzi]]''.\n\n==1990 to present==\nA new generation of directors has helped return Italian cinema to a healthy level since the end of the 1980s.  Probably the most noted film of the period is ''[[Nuovo Cinema Paradiso]]'', for which [[Giuseppe Tornatore]] won a 1989 Oscar (awarded in 1990) for Best Foreign Language Film.  This award was followed when [[Gabriele Salvatores]]'s ''[[Mediterraneo (film)|Mediterraneo]]'' won the same prize for 1991. ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'' (1994), directed by and starring [[Massimo Troisi]], received five nominations at the Academy Awards, and won for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. Another exploit was in [[1998 in film|1998]] when [[Roberto Benigni]] won three oscars for his movie ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' (''La vita \u00e8 bella)'' (Best Actor, Best Foreign Film, Best Music). In [[2001 in film|2001]] [[Nanni Moretti]]'s film ''[[The Son's Room]]'' (''La stanza del figlio'') received the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nOther noteworthy recent Italian films include: ''Jona che visse nella balena'' directed by [[Roberto Faenza]], ''Il grande cocomero'' by [[Francesca Archibugi]], ''[[The Profession of Arms (2001 film)|The Profession of Arms]]'' (''Il mestiere delle armi'') by Olmi, ''L'ora di religione'' by [[Marco Bellocchio]], ''Il ladro di bambini'', ''[[Lamerica]]'', ''[[The Keys to the House]]'' (''Le chiavi di casa'') by [[Gianni Amelio]], ''[[I'm Not Scared]]'' (''Io non ho paura'') by [[Gabriele Salvatores]], ''[[Le Fate Ignoranti|Le fate ignoranti]]'', ''[[Facing Windows]]'' (''La finestra di fronte'') by [[Ferzan \u00d6zpetek]], ''[[Good Morning, Night]]'' (''Buongiorno, notte'') by [[Ferzan \u00d6zpetek]], ''[[The Best of Youth]]'' (''La meglio giovent\u00f9'') by [[Marco Tullio Giordana]], ''[[The Beast in the Heart]]'' (''La bestia nel cuore'') by [[Cristina Comencini]].\n\nIn [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Paolo Sorrentino]]'s ''[[Il Divo (film)|Il Divo]]'', a [[biographical film]] based on the life of [[Giulio Andreotti]], won the Jury prize and ''[[Gomorra (film)|Gomorra]]'', a [[crime drama]] film, directed by [[Matteo Garrone]] won the Gran Prix at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nPaolo Sorrentino's ''[[The Great Beauty]]'' (''La Grande Bellezza'') won the [[86th Academy Awards|2014]] [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\nThe two highest-grossing Italian films have both been directed by [[Gennaro Nunziante]] and starred [[Checco Zalone]]: ''[[Sole a catinelle]]'' (2013) with \u20ac51.8 million, and ''[[Quo Vado?]]'' (2016) with \u20ac65.3 million.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/italy-box-office-local-hit-851830|title= Italy Box Office: Local Hit \u2018Quo Vado?\u2019 Sets Opening Records|first= Ariston|last= Anderson|date= January 4, 2016|accessdate= January 4, 2016|work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/italian-comedy-sun-buckets-sets-652968|title= Italian Comedy 'Sun in Buckets' Sets New Opening Weekend Sales Record|first= Eric J.|last= Lyman|date= November 4, 2013|accessdate= January 4, 2016|work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n''[[They Call Me Jeeg]]'', a 2016 critically acclaimed superhero film directed by Gabriele Mainetti and starring [[Claudio Santamaria]], won many awards, such as eight [[David di Donatello]], two [[Nastro d'Argento]], and a [[Globo d'oro]].\n\n[[Gianfranco Rosi (director)|Gianfranco Rosi]]'s documentary film ''[[Fire at Sea]]'' (2016) won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[66th Berlin International Film Festival]].

Filmmakers like [[Roman Polanski]], [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], [[Agnieszka Holland]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski]], [[Andrzej Munk]],  and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] impacted the development of Polish filmmaking.  In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made, and with a large number of independent filmmakers of all genres, Polish productions tend to be more inspired by [[American film]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\nThe first [[Movie theater|cinema]] in Poland (then occupied by the [[Russian Empire]]) was founded in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] in 1899, several years after the invention of the [[Cinematograph]]. Initially dubbed ''Living Pictures Theatre'', it gained much popularity and by the end of the next decade there were cinemas in almost every major town of Poland. Arguably the first Polish filmmaker was [[Kazimierz Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski]], who filmed various short documentaries in [[Warsaw]]. His [[pleograph]] [[film camera]] had been patented before the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]]' invention and he is credited as the author of the earliest surviving Polish documentary titled ''\u015alizgawka w \u0141azienkach'' (''Skating-rink in the [[Royal Baths]]''), as well as the first short [[narrative film]]s ''Powr\u00f3t birbanta'' (''Rake's return home'') and ''Przygoda doro\u017ckarza'' (''Cabman's Adventure''), both created in 1902. Another pioneer of cinema was [[Boles\u0142aw Matuszewski]], who became one of the first filmmakers working for the Lumi\u00e8re company - and the official \"cinematographer\" of the Russian tsars in 1897.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align      = right\n| direction  = vertical\n| width      = 180\n| image1     = \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Muzeum Kinematografii piwnice P5029858.JPG\n| caption1   = Museum of cinematography in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]\n| image2     = Pola Negri Ball.jpg\n| caption2   = [[Pola Negri]], Polish [[femme fatale]] of [[silent film|silent cinema]]\n| image3     = \n| caption3   = [[Eugeniusz Bodo]], the \"King of Polish actors\" of the 1930s\n| image4     = Andrzej Wajda OFF Plus Camera 2012 (cropped).jpg\n| caption4   = [[Andrzej Wajda]], famous Polish director who received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]] in 2000\n}}\n\nThe earliest surviving [[feature film]], the ''Anto\u015b pierwszy raz w Warszawie'' (''Anto\u015b for the First Time in Warsaw'') was made in 1908 by [[Antoni Fertner]]. The date of its [[premi\u00e8re]], October 22, 1908, is considered the founding date of Polish [[film industry]]. Soon Polish artists started experimenting with other genres of cinema: in 1910 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Starewicz]] made one of the first [[animated cartoon]]s in the world - and the first to use the [[stop motion]] technique, the ''Pi\u0119kna Lukanida'' (''Beautiful Lukanida''). By the start of [[World War I]] the cinema in Poland was already in full swing, with numerous adaptations of major works of [[Polish literature]] screened (notably the ''[[Dzieje grzechu]]'', ''Meir Ezofowicz'' and ''[[Nad Niemnem]]''.\n\nDuring the World War I the Polish cinema crossed borders. Films made in Warsaw or Vilna were often rebranded with German language [[intertitle]]s and shown in [[Berlin]]. That was how a young actress [[Pola Negri]] (born Barbara Apolonia Cha\u0142upiec) gained fame in Germany and eventually became one of the European super-stars of [[silent film]].\n\nDuring the World War II Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film ''Calling mr. Smith''<ref>https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1</ref><ref>https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9</ref><ref>http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/</ref> (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about lies of nazi propaganda. It was one of the first anti-nazi films in history being both avant-garde and documentary film.\n\n===After WWII===\n\nIn November 1945 the communist government founded the film production and distribution organization [[Film Polski]], and put the well-known [[Polish People's Army]] filmmaker [[Aleksander Ford]] in charge.  Starting with a few railway carriages full of film equipment taken from the Germans they proceed to train and build a Polish film industry. The FP output was limited; only thirteen features were released between 1947 and its dissolution in 1952, concentrating on Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis.<ref name=\"Haltof2002\">Marek Haltof (2002). ''[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/965534.Polish_National_Cinema  Polish national cinema.]'' Berghahn Books, p. 49. {{ISBN|157181275X}}.</ref> In 1947 Ford moved to help establish the new [[National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], where he taught for 20 years.\n\nThe industry used imported cameras and film stocks.  At first ORWO black and white film stock from East Germany and then Eastman colour negative stock and ORWO print stocks for rushes and release prints. Poland made its own lighting equipment.  Because of the high costs of film stock Polish films were shot with very low shooting ratios, the amount of film stock used in shooting the film to length of the finished film. The equipment and film stock were not the best and budgets were modest but the film makers received probably the best training in the world from the Polish Film School.  Another advantage was that as Film Polski was a state organisation film makers had access to all Polish institutions and their cooperation in making their films. Film cameras were able to enter almost every aspect of Polish life.\n\nThe first film produced in Poland following the World War II was ''[[Zakazane piosenki]]'' (1946), directed by [[Leonard Buczkowski]], which was seen by 10.8 million people (out of 23,8 total population) in its initial theatrical run.<ref name=\"Haltof\">{{cite book | author =Marek Haltof | title =Polish national cinema | year =2002 | editor = | pages =49\u201350 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Berghahn Books | location = | isbn=978-1-57181-276-6 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> Buczkowski continued to make films regularly until his death in 1967. Other important films of early post-World War II period were ''[[The Last Stage]]'' (1948), directed by [[Wanda Jakubowska]], who continued to make films until the transition from communism to capitalism in 1989, and ''[[Border Street]]'' (1949), directed by Aleksander Ford.\n\nBy the mid 1950s, following the end of [[Stalinism in Poland]], Film production was organised into film groups. A film group was a collection of film makers, led by an experienced film director and consisting of writers, film directors and production managers. They would write scripts, create budgets, apply for funding off the Ministry of Culture and produce the picture. They would hire actors and crew, and use studios and laboratories controlled by Film Polski.\n\nThe change in political climate gave rise to the [[Polish Film School]] movement, a training ground for some of the icons of the world cinematography, e.g., [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Knife in the Water (film)|Knife in the Water]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'', ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'') and [[Krzysztof Zanussi]] (a leading director of the so-called ''cinema of moral anxiety'' of the 1970s). [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s films offer insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances. His films defined several Polish generations. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his overall contribution to cinema. Four of his films were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] award at [[Academy Awards]] with five other Polish directors receiving one nomination each: [[Roman Pola\u0144ski]], [[Jerzy Kawalerowicz]], [[Jerzy Hoffman]], [[Jerzy Antczak]] and [[Agnieszka Holland]]. In 2015, Polish filmmaker [[Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski]] received this award for his film ''[[Ida (film)|Ida]]''.\n\nIt is also important to note that during the 80's, the People's Republic of Poland instituted the [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] to vanquish and censor all forms of opposition against the communist rule of the nation, including outlets such as cinema and radio. A notable film to have emerged during this period was [[Ryszard Bugajski]]'s 1982 film ''[[Interrogation (1982 film)|Interrogation]]'' (''Przesluchanie''), which depicts the story of an unfortunate woman (played by [[Krystyna Janda]]) who is arrested and tortured by the secret police into confessing a crime she knows nothing about. The [[anti-communist]] nature of the film brought about the film's over seven-year ban. In 1989, the ban was repealed after the [[Revolutions of 1989#Reform in Poland|overthrow of the Communist government in Poland]], and the film was shown in theaters for the first time later that year. The film is still lauded today for its audacity in depicting the cruelty of the Stalinist regime, as many artists feared persecution during that time.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-26/entertainment/ca-912_1_krystyna-janda |title=MOVIE REVIEW - 'Interrogation': Janda's Arresting Performance - Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2009-09-23|work=Los Angeles Times | first=Sheila | last=Benson | date=1990-09-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Przesluchanie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.secondrundvd.com/release_more_int.php |title=Second Run DVD - Interrogation |accessdate=2009-09-24|work=Second Run DVD}}</ref>\n{{Culture of Poland}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]] won a universal acclaim with productions such as ''[[Dekalog]]'' (made for television), ''[[The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique]]'' and the ''[[Three Colors]]'' trilogy. Another of the most famous movies in Poland is [[Krzysztof Krauze]]\u2019s [[The Debt (1999 film)|The Debt]], which became a blockbuster.<ref>[http://www.eurochannel.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&Itemid=355&id=355&lang=en&view=article Presentation of the Polish cinema on Eurochannel website]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It showed the brutal reality of Polish capitalism and the growth of poverty.  A considerable number of Polish film directors (e.g., [[Agnieszka Holland]] and [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]]) have worked in American studios. Polish animated films - like those by [[Jan Lenica]] and [[Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski]] (Oscar, 1983) - drew on a long tradition and continued to derive their inspiration from Poland's graphic arts. Other notable Polish film directors include: [[Tomasz Bagi\u0144ski]], [[Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska]], [[Jan Jakub Kolski]], [[Jerzy Kawalerowicz]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Bareja]] and [[Janusz Zaorski]].\n\nAmong prominent annual film festivals taking place in Poland are: [[Warsaw International Film Festival]], [[Camerimage]], [[International Festival of Independent Cinema Off Camera]], [[New Horizons Film Festival]] as well as [[Gdynia Film Festival]] and [[Polish Film Awards]].\n\n====Cinema audience====\n\nThe Communist government invested resources into building a sophisticated cinema audience. All the cinema were state owned and consisted of first run premiere cinema, local cinema and art house cinemas. Tickets were cheap and students and old people received discounts. In the city of Lodz there were 36 cinemas in the 1970s showing films from all over the world. There were the Italian films of Fellini, French comedies, American crime movies such as Don Siegel's \"Charley Varrick\" . Films were shown in their original versions with Polish subtitles.  Anti communist and cold war films were not shown, but a bigger restriction was the cost of some films. There were popular film magazines like \"Film\" and \"Screen\", critical magazines such as \"Kino\". This all helped to build a well informed film audience.\n\n== Notable films ==\n{{main article|List of Polish films}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Maria and Bogdan Kalinowski]]\n* [[Cinema of the world]]\n* [[History of cinema]]\n* [[List of famous Poles]]\n* [[List of film festivals]]\n* [[List of film formats]]\n* [[List of film techniques]]\n* [[List of film-related topics|List of motion picture-related topics]] (Extensive alphabetical listing and glossary).\n* [[List of video-related topics]]\n* [[National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]\n* [[New York Polish Film Festival]]\n* [[Outline of film]]\n* [[Piotr Zawojski]]\n* [[Polish film school]]\n* [[Seattle Polish Film Festival]]\n* [[World cinema]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://culture.pl/multimediaguides/cinema A Foreigner's Guide to Polish Cinema] from Culture.pl\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Iordanova |first=Dina |authorlink=Dina Iordanova |year=2003 |title=Cinema of the Other Europe: The industry and artistry of East Central European film |url= |location=London |publisher=Wallflower |isbn=9781903364611 }}\n\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n* This article may be expanded with text translated from [[:pl:Kinematografia w Polsce|the corresponding article]] in the [[Polish Wikipedia]].\n\n{{Filmmaking}}\n{{Cinema of Poland}}\n{{Poland topics}}\n{{Worldcinema}}\n\n[[Category:Cinema of Poland| ]]\n[[Category:National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]", "sha1": "pgpgbimwyz5jd9ag723x46puq7fk80e"}}, {"title": "Cinema of Japan", "ns": "0", "id": "10790", "revision": {"id": "865612705", "parentid": "861128443", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T01:16:11Z", "contributor": {"ip": "164.58.66.111"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox cinema market\n| name                 = Cinema of Japan\n| image                = Kobe Shinkaichi05s3200.jpg\n| image_size           = \n| alt                  = \n| caption              = Shingeki-kaikan (now ''cinema KOBE'') in [[Kobe]]\n| screens              = 3,437 (2015)<ref name=eiren>{{cite web|title=Statistics of Film Industry in Japan|url=http://www.eiren.org/statistics_e/|publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>\n| screens_per_capita   = 2.9 per 100,000 (2011)<ref name=screens_uis>{{cite web|title=Table 8: Cinema Infrastructure - Capacity|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=5542|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref>\n| distributors         = {{br separated entries|[[Toho]] (32.6%)|[[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Walt Disney]] (10.7%)|[[Toei Company]] (8.9%)}}<ref name=distributors_uis>{{cite web|title=Table 6: Share of Top 3 distributors (Excel)|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref>\n| produced_year        = \n| produced_ref         = \n| produced_total       = \n| produced_fictional   = \n| produced_animated    = \n| produced_documentary = \n| admissions_year      = 2015\n| admissions_ref       = <ref name=eiren/>\n| admissions_total     = 166,630,000\n| admissions_national  = \n| box_office_year      = 2015\n| box_office_ref       = <ref name=eiren/>\n| box_office_total     = {{JPY|217.119 billion}} ({{USD|1.8 billion}})<ref name=\"Frater\">{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2016/film/box-office/asia-expands-domination-of-global-box-office-1201752360/|title= Asia Expands Domination of Global Box Office|first= Patrick|last= Frater|date= April 13, 2016|accessdate= April 19, 2016|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref name=eiren/>\n| box_office_national  = {{JPY|120.367 billion}} (55.4%)<ref name=eiren/>\n}}\n{{Japan film list}}\nThe {{Nihongo|'''cinema of Japan'''|\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b|Nihon eiga|extra=also known domestically as \u90a6\u753b ''h\u014dga'', \"domestic cinema\"}} has a history that spans more than 100 years.

Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsud\u014d shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsud\u014d Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nNew studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eiz\u014d Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (e.g., ''[[The Life of Oharu]]'') are still highly regarded.\n\nJapanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]], [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.\n\nWith the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-wing \"tendencies\", with prominent examples being directed by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]]. In contrast with these commercially produced [[35 mm film]]s, the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19\u201347.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Ky\u014dfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>\n\nA later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on inflammable and unstable [[Film base#Nitrate|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]\nUnlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'', considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).\n\nFilm criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genj\u016b Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>\n\nThe 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.\n\n===1940s===\n{{further|War film}}\nBecause of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.\n\nDuring this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.\n\n[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943. The first collaborations between Kurosawa and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] were ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' in 1948 and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' in 1949.

This period gave rise to the four great artists of Japanese cinema: [[Masaki Kobayashi]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways.\n\nThe decade started with [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''Rashomon'' (1950), which won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951 and the [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage.

The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.\n\nKenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujir\u014d Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].\n\nThe [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[Until We Meet Again (1950 film)|Until We Meet Again]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]].\n\n===1960s===\nThe number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/japanesecinemain195060/ ''Japanese Cinema in the 1950s and 1960s'']</ref> Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a \"program picture\" or B-movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.\n\nThe huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujir\u014d Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.\n\nKon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).\n\nThe 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Ab\u00e9 Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTeshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]].

The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.\n\n[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'\u00c9tat]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.\n\nIn 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.\n\n[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Sh\u014dhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).\n\n''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.\n\nOf the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. [[Shohei Imamura]] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1983). [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made ''[[A Promise (1986 film)|A Promise]]'' (1986), his first film since 1973's ''Coup d'\u00c9tat''.\n\nNew directors who appeared in the 80s include actor [[Juzo Itami]], who directed his first film, ''[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]'', in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with ''[[Tampopo]]'' in 1985. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1983. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.\n\n[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.\n\n===1990s===\n\nBecause of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.\n\n[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sh\u014dhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sj\u00f6berg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997). [[Takashi Miike]] launched a prolific career with titles such as ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'' (1999), ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Bird People in China]]'' (1998). Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).\n\nHayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;\u2013 which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the highest-grossing film in Japan&nbsp;\u2013 and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).\n\nSeveral new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.\n\n===2000s===\n\n\n\nThe number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be \"Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age\", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.<ref name=\"Kehr\">Dave Kehr, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.</ref>\n\nAlthough not a commercial success, ''[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]'' directed by [[Shunji Iwai]] was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' and directed and starred in ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' and ''[[Zatoichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]''. Several horror films, ''[[Kairo (film)|Kairo]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Yogen]]'', [[Ju-on|the ''Grudge'' series]] and ''[[One Missed Call (2004 film)|One Missed Call]]'' met with commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', directed by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director [[Seijun Suzuki]] made his 56th film, ''[[Princess Raccoon]]''. [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films ''[[Distance (film)|Distance]]'' and ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]''. Female film director [[Naomi Kawase]]'s film ''[[The Mourning Forest]]'' won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. [[Yoji Yamada]], director of the [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]] series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's ''[[Twilight Samurai]]'', followed by ''[[The Hidden Blade]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Love and Honor (2006 film)|Love and Honor]]'' in 2006.\n\n[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]\n\nIn anime, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] directed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards\u2014including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] in 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|title=The 75th Academy Awards (2003)|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|deadurl=no|accessdate=December 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128072357/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|archivedate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\u2014followed by ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Ponyo]]'' in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film ''[[The Sky Crawlers]]'' was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', ''[[Tokyo Godfathers]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]''. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] released ''[[Steamboy]]'', his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]'', in 2004. In collaboration with [[Studio 4C]], American director [[Michael Arias]] released ''[[Tekkon Kinkreet]]'' in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, [[Hideaki Anno]] formed [[Studio Khara|his own production studio]] and revisited his still-popular ''Evangelion'' franchise with the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.\n\nIn February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government&nbsp;\u2013 on both the national and local levels&nbsp;\u2013 must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.\n\n===2010s===\nFour films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: ''[[Caterpillar (2010 film)|Caterpillar]]'' by [[K\u014dji Wakamatsu]] was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] and won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]], ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' by [[Takeshi Kitano]] was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Himizu (film)|Himizu]]'' by [[Sion Sono]] was in competition for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 2011, [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai]]'' was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], the first [[3D film]] ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence]]'' and '' [[Taboo (1999 film)|Taboo]]'', [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'', and Miike's ''[[13 Assassins (2010 film)|13 Assassins]]'' onto the international stage as producer.\n\nIn 2018, [[Hirokazu Kore-Eda]] won the Palme d'Or for his movie ''[[Shoplifters (film)|Shoplifters]]'' at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|71st Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Genres==\n[[File:Samurai actors.jpg|thumb|Actors playing samurai and ronin at [[Kyoto]]'s [[Toei Kyoto Studio Park|Eigamura]] film studio]] \nGenres of Japanese film include:{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n* '''[[Jidaigeki]]''': period pieces set during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) or earlier.\n** '''[[Samurai cinema]]''', a subgenre of ''jidaigeki'', also known as ''chambara'' ([[onomatopoeia]] describing the sound of swords clashing).\n* '''[[Japanese horror|Horror]]''': [[horror film]]s such as ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''\n* '''[[Tokusatsu]]'''\n** '''[[Kaiju]]''': [[monster]] films, such as ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''\n* '''[[Pink film]]s''': [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] [[pornographic film]]s.\n* '''[[Yakuza film]]s''': films about [[Yakuza]] mobsters.\n* '''[[Gendaigeki]]''': the opposite of \"jidaigeki\", films set in the present day.\n* '''[[Shomingeki]]''': realistic films about common working people\n* '''[[Anime]]''': [[Animation]].

The first [[sound film]], ''Sing-Song Girl Red Peony'', using the [[sound-on-disc]] technology, was made in 1931. The 1930s, considered the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] was reflected in the films produced. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to [[Hong Kong]], [[Chongqing]] and other places, starting a \"Solitary Island\" period in Shanghai, referring to the city's foreign concessions, with the remaining filmmakers working there. ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), the first [[Chinese animation|Chinese animated]] feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later [[Osamu Tezuka]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = \"A Wartime Romance: Princess Iron Fan and the Chinese Connection in Early Japanese Animation,\" in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China.|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison.|year = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 15\u201360}}</ref>  After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.\n\nAfter the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming, with films such as ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), named the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|best Chinese-language film]] at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]]. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] in 1949, previous and some foreign films were banned in 1951, and movie attendance increased sharply. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the \"scar dramas\" of the 1980s, such as ''[[Evening Rain]]'' (1980), ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' (1980) and ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984), the rise of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences, with films like ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' (1987), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) winning major international awards. The movement partially ended after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system and played mostly on the international film festival circuit.\n\nFollowing the international commercial success of films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 [[List of highest-grossing films in China|highest-grossing films in China]] are domestic productions. ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach {{CNY|1 billion}} at the Chinese box office, ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) was the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}, ''[[The Mermaid (2016 film)|The Mermaid]]'' (2016) was the first to {{CNY|3 billion}} and ''[[Wolf Warriors 2|Wolf Warrior 2]]'' (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film in China.\n\nChina is the home of the largest movie & drama production complex and film studios in the world, the [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qingdao-china-movie-metropolis-easts-massive-wanda-studios-943117|title=Breathtaking Photos From Inside the China Studio Luring Hollywood East|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Wanda Unveils Plans for $8 Billion 'Movie Metropolis,' Reveals Details About Film Incentives|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wanda-unveils-plans-8-billion-939003|work=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en}}</ref> and [[Hengdian World Studios]], and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually.

Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, ''[[Laborer's Love]]'' (1922).<ref name=Centennial>{{cite web| url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| title = A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema| accessdate = 2007-04-26| author = Zhang Yingjin| date = 2003-10-10| publisher = University of California-San Diego| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907160026/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| archivedate = 2008-09-07| df = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | title = A Brief History of Chinese Film | accessdate = 2007-04-24 | publisher = Ohio State University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410062249/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | archivedate = 2014-04-10 | df =  }}</ref><ref>Berry, Chris. \"China Before 1949\", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997).

These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in ''Spring Silkworms'' and a prostitute in ''The Goddess''.<ref name=Geiselmann/> In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema.<ref name=Geiselmann/> The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.<ref>Laikwan Pang, ''Building a New China in Cinema'' (Rowman and Littlefield Productions, Oxford, 2002)</ref>\n\nThree [[production company|production companies]] dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua]] (\"United China\"),{{efn|Lianhua is also sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the \"United Photoplay Service\"}} the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/international/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archivedate = 2010-08-02 | title = Timeline | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | author = Kraicer, Shelly |date= 2005-12-06| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so),<ref name=Geiselmann/> while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.\n\n[[File:Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm.ogv|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[Children of Troubled Times]]'', a patriotic 1935 Chinese film most famous as the origin of \"The March of the Volunteers\", the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.]]\n\nThe period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as [[Hu Die]], [[Ruan Lingyu]], [[Li Lili]], [[Chen Yanyan]], [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Zhao Dan]] and [[Jin Yan]]. Other major films of the period include ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931), ''[[Little Toys]]'' (1933), ''[[New Women]]'' (1934), ''[[Song of the Fishermen]]'' (1934), ''[[Plunder of Peach and Plum]]'' (1934), ''[[Crossroads (1937 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1937), and ''[[Street Angel (1937 film)|Street Angel]]'' (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.\n\n===Japanese occupation and World War II===\n\n[[File:ZhouXuan1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Zhou Xuan]], an iconic Chinese singer and film actress.]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, in particular the [[Battle of Shanghai]], ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except [[Xinhua Film Company]] (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to [[Hong Kong]], the wartime Nationalist capital [[Chongqing]], and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"[[Solitary Island]]\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director [[Bu Wancang]]'s ''[[Mulan Joins the Army (1939 film)|Mulan Joins the Army]]'' (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war.<ref name=Centennial/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| title = Sole Island Movies| accessdate = 2006-08-18| author = Ministry of Culture Staff| year = 2003| publisher = ChinaCulture.org| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826094341/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| archivedate = 2006-08-26| df = }}</ref> This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation.

''The Spring River Flows East'', a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and [[Zheng Junli]], was a particularly strong success.

Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae.

Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called \"revolutionary model operas\". The most notable of these was a [[ballet]] version of the revolutionary opera ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1970 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the [[Gang of Four]] until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's ''[[Breaking with Old Ideas]]'', were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.<ref>Zhang, Yingjin & Xiao, Zhiwei. \"Breaking with Old Ideas\" in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film''. Taylor & Francis (1998), p. 101. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.</ref>\n\nIn the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=638}}</ref> Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign [[film festival]]s sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and \"exploratory\" films like their counterparts in the West.\n\nIn the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and [[martial art]]s films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] to the newly formed [[Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television (China)|Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television]] to bring it under \"stricter control and management\" and to \"strengthen supervision over production.\"\n\nThe end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of \"scar dramas\", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of \"[[reform and opening up]].\" For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] was given to two \"scar dramas\", ''[[Evening Rain]]'' ([[Wu Yonggang]], [[Wu Yigong]], 1980) and ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' ([[Xie Jin]], 1980).<ref>Yau, Esther. \"China After the Revolution\", in ''The Oxford history of world cinema'' edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 698.</ref>\n\nMany scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. ''The Blue Kite'', though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.\n\n==Rise of the Fifth Generation==\n[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|A movie theater in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]]]]\nBeginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the [[Beijing Film Academy]] in 1982 and included [[Zhang Yimou]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], [[Chen Kaige]], [[Zhang Junzhao]] and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the [[Cultural Revolution]] and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm | title = The Irresistible Rise of Asian Cinema-Tian Zhuangzhuang: A Director of the 21st Century| accessdate = 2007-04-23 |date= 2002-11-19 | author=Yvonne Ng|publisher = Kinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073506/http://kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}</ref> After the so-called [[scar literature]] in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation.{{efn|Notably Zhang Yimou served as cinematographer for both films.}} The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as ''[[King of the Children]]'' (1987), ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1989), ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western [[art film|arthouse]] audience. [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', the 1992 [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', the 1993 [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', and three [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] nominations from the Academy Awards.<ref name=Greatfall/> All these award-winning films starred actress [[Gong Li]], who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.\n\nDiverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from [[black comedy]] ([[Huang Jianxin]]'s ''[[The Black Cannon Incident]]'', 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's ''[[Life on a String (film)|Life on a String]]'', 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include [[Wu Ziniu]], [[Hu Mei]], [[Li Shaohong]] and [[Zhou Xiaowen]]. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=639\u2013640}}</ref> Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.\n\nThese films came with a new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and [[long shot]]s. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=638\u2013640}}</ref>\n\nThe Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. [[Wu Tianming]], in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the [[Xi'an Film Studio]] (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'' (1986) and ''[[The King of Masks]]'' (1996).\n\nThe Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Incident]], although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the [[United States]] (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for [[Australia]], while many others went into television-related works.\n\n==Main melody dramas==\nIn 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes \"the main melody\" (\u4e3b\u65cb\u5f8b) to \"invigorate national spirit and national pride\".<ref>Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''.

Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like [[16 mm film]] and [[digital video]] and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to [[Italian neorealism]] and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation.<ref name=Greatfall>Rose, S.

Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''[[The Horse Thief]]'' (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a [[Tibet]]an horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.<ref>''Celluloid China: cinematic encounters with culture and society'', Harry H.

His [[historical drama]] ''[[Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker]]'' (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.\n\nRecent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, [[L\u00fc Yue]] made ''[[Mr. Zhao]]'' (1998), a [[black comedy]] film well received abroad. [[Gu Changwei]]'s [[minimalism|minimalist]] epic ''[[Peacock (2005 film)|Peacock]]'' (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Hou Yong (cinematographer)|Hou Yong]] is another cinematographer who made films (''[[Jasmine Women]]'', 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing.

Her second film ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004 film)|Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (2004) landed her the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is [[Zhao Wei]], whose directorial debut ''[[So Young (film)|So Young]]'' (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.\n\nThe most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly [[Jiang Wen]], who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]] held in [[Taiwan]]. His other films, like ''[[Devils on the Doorstep]]'' (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010), were similarly well received.

Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of [[Ang Lee]]'s period [[wuxia|martial arts]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' which won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the [[wuxia]] genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date ''Crouching Tiger'' remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.\n\nSimilarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including [[Jet Li]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]]. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, ''Hero'' was a phenomenal success in most of [[Asia]] and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.\n\nOther films such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', ''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' were critically acclaimed around the world. The [[Hengdian World Studios]] can be seen as the \"Chinese Hollywood\", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the [[Forbidden City]].\n\nThe successes of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and ''Hero'' make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between \"Mainland Chinese\" cinema and a more international-based \"Chinese-language cinema\". ''Crouching Tiger'', for example, was directed by a [[Taiwan]]-born American director ([[Ang Lee]]) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), Hong Kong ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), Taiwan ([[Chang Chen]]) and [[Malaysia]]n ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]]. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader [[East Asia]] and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005), ''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'' (2006), ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), ''[[The Warlords]]'' (2007), ''[[Bodyguards and Assassins]]'' (2009) and ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'' (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like [[Hu Jun]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Tang Wei]] and [[Zhou Xun]], obtained Hong Kong residency under the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]] and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |title=Zhou Xun Obtains Hong Kong Citizenship<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2016-02-05

Paul]] and [[Birt Acres]]. They made the first British film ''[[Incident at Clovelly Cottage]]'' in February 1895, shortly before falling out over the camera's patent. Soon several British film companies had opened to meet the demand for new films, such as [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] in [[Blackburn]].\n\nAlthough the earliest British films were of everyday events, the early 20th century saw the appearance of narrative shorts, mainly comedies and melodramas.  The early films were often melodramatic in tone, and there was a distinct preference for story lines already known to the audience, in particular, adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] plays and [[Dickens]] novels.\n\n[[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|The Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] first brought their show to London in 1896.  In 1898 American producer [[Charles Urban]] expanded the London-based [[Warwick Trading Company]] to produce British films, mostly documentary and news.\n\nIn 1898 [[Gaumont-British|Gaumont-British Picture Corp.]] was founded as a subsidiary of the French [[Gaumont Film Company]], constructing [[Lime Grove Studios]] in [[West London (sub region)|West London]] in 1915 in the first building built in Britain solely for film production. Also in 1898 [[Hepworth Studios]] was founded in [[Lambeth]], South London by [[Cecil Hepworth]], the [[Bamforths]] began producing films in [[Yorkshire]], and [[William Haggar]] began producing films in [[Wales]].\n\nIn 1902 [[Ealing Studios]] was founded by [[Will Barker]], becoming the oldest continuously-operating film studio in the world.\n\nIn 1902 the earliest colour film in the world was made; like other films made at the time, it is of everyday events.  In 2012 it was found by the National Science and Media Museum in [[Bradford]] after lying forgotten in an old tin for 110 years. The previous title for earliest colour film, using Urban's inferior [[Kinemacolor]] process, was thought to date from 1909. The re-discovered films were made by pioneer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] from London who patented his process on 22 March 1899.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951 \"World's first colour moving pictures discovered\"]. BBC News, 12 September 2012. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.</ref>\n\nIn 1903 Urban formed the [[Charles Urban Trading Company]], which produced early colour films using his patented Kinemacolor process. This was later challenged in court by Greene, causing the company to go out of business in 1915.\n\nIn 1903 [[Frank Mottershaw]] of [[Sheffield]] produced the film ''[[A Daring Daylight Robbery]]'', which launched the chase genre.\n\nIn 1911 the [[Ideal Film Company]] was founded in [[Soho, London]], distributing almost 400 films by 1934, and producing 80.\n\nIn 1913 stage director [[Maurice Elvey]] began directing British films, becoming Britain's most prolific film director, with almost 200 by 1957.\n\nIn 1914 [[Elstree Studios]] was founded, and acquired in 1928 by German-born [[Ludwig Blattner]], who invented a magnetic steel tape recording system that was adopted by the [[BBC]] in 1930.\n\nIn 1920 Gaumont opened [[Islington Studios]], where [[Alfred Hitchcock]] got his start, selling-out to [[Gainsborough Pictures]] in 1927. Also in 1920 [[Cricklewood Studios]] was founded by Sir [[Oswald Stoll]], becoming Britain's largest film studio, known for [[Fu Manchu]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]] film series.\n\n[[File:Leslie Howard GWTW.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|Leslie Howard]]\n\nIn 1920 the short-lived company [[Minerva Films]] was founded in London by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] (also producer and director) and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]].  Some of their early films include four written by [[A. A. Milne]] including ''[[The Bump (film)|The Bump]]'', starring [[C.

The [[Slump of 1924]] caused many British film studios to close, resulting in the passage of the [[Cinematograph Films Act 1927]] to boost local production, requiring that cinemas show a certain percentage of British films. The act was technically a success, with audiences for British films becoming larger than the quota required, but it had the effect of creating a market for poor quality, low cost films, made to satisfy the quota. The \"quota quickies\", as they became known, are often blamed by historians for holding back the development of the industry. However, some British film makers, such as [[Michael Powell]], learnt their craft making such films.\n\nIronically, the biggest star of the silent era, English comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]], was [[Hollywood]]-based.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462570/index.html|title=Chaplin, Charles (1889\u20131977)|accessdate=11 December 2010|publisher=British Film Institute}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|Alfred Hitchcock]]\n\n===The early sound period===\nScottish solicitor [[John Maxwell (producer)|John Maxwell]] founded [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] (BIP) in 1927.

It was Grierson who coined the term \"[[Documentary film|documentary]]\" to describe a non-fiction film, and he produced the movement's most celebrated early films, ''[[Night Mail]]'' (1936), written and directed by [[Basil Wright]] and [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], and incorporating the poem by [[W. H. Auden]] towards the end of the short.\n\n[[Music hall]]s also proved influential in [[comedy films]] of this period, and a number of popular personalities emerged, including [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Jessie Matthews]] and [[Will Hay]]. These stars often made several films a year, and their productions remained important for morale purposes during [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:Alexander-Korda-1936.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Alexander Korda]]\nMany of the British films with larger budgets during the 1930s were produced by [[London Films]], founded by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] ''emigre'' [[Alexander Korda]]. The success of ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933), made at [[Elstree Studios#British and Dominion Studios, Borehamwood|British and Dominion]] in Elstree, persuaded [[United Artists]] and [[Prudential plc|The Prudential]] to invest in Korda's [[Denham Film Studios]], which opened in May 1936, but both investors suffered losses as a result.<ref>Warren (2001), pp. 26, 28.</ref> Korda's films before the war included ''[[Things to Come]]'', ''[[Rembrandt (1936 film)|Rembrandt]]'' (both 1936) and ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), as well as the early [[Technicolor|Technicolour]] films ''[[The Drum (film)|The Drum]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Four Feathers (1939 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1939). These had followed closely on from ''[[Wings of the Morning (1937 film)|Wings of the Morning]]'' (1937), the UK's first three-strip Technicolour feature film, made by the local offshoot of [[20th Century Fox]]. Although some of Korda's films indulged in  \"unrelenting pro-Empire flag waving\", those featuring [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]] turned him into \"a huge international star\";<ref>Mark Duguid, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/445836/index.html \"Korda and Empuire\"], BFI screenonline.</ref> \"for many years\" he had the highest profile of any actor of Indian origin.<ref>Michael Brooke, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/459165/index.html \"Sabu (1924\u20131963)\"], BFI screenonline.</ref> [[Paul Robeson]] was also cast in leading roles when \"there were hardly any opportunities\" for African Americans \"to play challenging roles\" in their own country's productions.<ref>[[Stephen Bourne (writer)|Stephen Bourne]], [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/446731/index.html \"Robeson, Paul (1898\u20131976)\"], BFI screenonline.</ref>\n\nRising expenditure and over-optimistic expectations of expansion into the American market caused a financial crisis in 1937,<ref>Sarah Street ''British National Cinema'', London: Routledge, 2009, p. 12.</ref> after an all-time high of 192 films were released in 1936. Of the 640 British production companies registered between 1925 and 1936, only 20 were still active in 1937. Moreover, the 1927 Films Act was up for renewal. The replacement Cinematograph Films Act 1938 provided incentives, via a \"[[Cinematograph Films Council|quality test]]\", for UK companies to make fewer films, but of higher quality, and to eliminate the \"quota quickies\". Influenced by world politics, it encouraged American investment and imports. One result was the creation of [[MGM-British Studios|MGM-British]], an English subsidiary of the largest American studio, which produced four films before the war, including ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1939).\n\nThe new venture was initially based at Denham Studios. Korda himself lost control of the facility in 1939 to the [[Rank Organisation]], whose own [[Pinewood Studios]] had opened at the end of September 1936.<ref>Warren (2001), pp. 29, 119.</ref> Circumstances forced Korda's ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), a spectacular fantasy film, to be completed in California, where Korda continued his film career during the war.\n\nBy now contracted to [[Gaumont British]], Alfred Hitchcock had settled on the thriller genre by the mid-1930s with ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938). Lauded in Britain where he was dubbed \"Alfred the Great\" by ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, Hitchcock's reputation was beginning to develop  overseas, with a ''[[The New York Times]]'' feature writer asserting; \"Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. [[Magna Carta]], the [[Tower Bridge]] and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.\"<ref>Leff, Leonard J., ''The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood''. University of California Press, 1999, p. 16.</ref> Hitchcock was then signed up to a seven-year contract by Selznick and moved to [[Hollywood]].\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Humphrey Jennings]] began his career as a documentary film maker just before the war, in some cases working in collaboration with co-directors. ''[[London Can Take It]]'' (with [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Wat]], 1940) detailed the blitz while ''[[Listen to Britain]]''<ref name=\"indep3909\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/britains-world-war-ii-films-were-more-than-just-propaganda-1780730.html|title=Britain's World War II films were more than just propaganda|author=Gerard Gilbert|accessdate=3 May 2012|work=The Independent|date=3 September 2009}}</ref> (with [[Stewart McAllister]], 1942) looked at the home front. The [[Crown Film Unit]],<ref name=indep3909/> part of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] took over the responsibilities of the GPO Film Unit in 1940. [[Paul Rotha]] and [[Alberto Cavalcanti]] were colleagues of Jennings. British films began to make use of documentary techniques; Cavalcanti joined [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] for ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942),\n\nMany other films helped to shape the popular image of the nation at war. Among the best known of these films are ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942), ''[[We Dive at Dawn]]'' (1943), ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944). The war years also saw the emergence of [[Powell and Pressburger|The Archers]] partnership between director Michael Powell and the Hungarian-born writer-producer [[Emeric Pressburger]] with films such as ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943) and ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944).\n\n[[Two Cities Films]], an independent production company releasing their films through a Rank subsidiary, also made some important films, including the [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and David Lean collaborations ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' (1944) and ''[[Blithe Spirit (film)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1945) as well as [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' (1944). By this time, [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] Studios were releasing their series of critically derided but immensely popular period melodramas, including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945). New stars, such as [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[James Mason]], emerged in the Gainsborough films.\n\n===Post-war cinema===\n[[File:Deborah Kerr 3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Deborah Kerr]] as Sister Clodagh in ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947).]]\nTowards the end of the 1940s, the [[Rank Organisation]], founded in 1937 by [[J. Arthur Rank]], became the dominant force behind British film-making, having acquired a number of British studios and the Gaumont chain (in 1941) to add to its [[Odeon Cinemas#History|Odeon Cinemas]]. Rank's serious financial crisis in 1949, a substantial loss and debt, resulted in the contraction of its film production.<ref>Warren (2001), p. 120.</ref> In practice, Rank maintained an industry duopoly with ABPC (later absorbed by EMI) for many years.\n\nFor the moment, the industry hit new heights of creativity in the immediate post-war years. Among the most significant films produced during this period were [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' (1945) and his Dickens adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948), [[Carol Reed]]'s thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948), the most commercially successful film of its year in the United States. Laurence Olivier's ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (also 1948), was the first non-American film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Ealing Studios (financially backed by Rank) began to produce their most celebrated comedies, with three of the best remembered films, ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore]]'' (1948), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'' (both 1949), being on release almost simultaneously. Their [[Portmanteau film|portmanteau]] horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]'' (1945) is also particularly highly regarded.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the British industry began to concentrate on popular comedies and World War II dramas aimed more squarely at the domestic audience. The war films were often based on true stories and made in a similar low-key style to their wartime predecessors. They helped to make stars of actors like [[John Mills]], [[Jack Hawkins]] and [[Kenneth More]]. Some of the most successful included ''[[The Cruel Sea (1953 film)|The Cruel Sea]]'' (1953), ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1954), ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1955) and ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'' (1956).\n\nThe Rank Organisation produced some comedy successes, such as ''[[Genevieve (film)|Genevieve]]'' (1953). The writer/director/producer team of twin brothers [[John and Roy Boulting]] also produced a series of successful satires on British life and institutions, beginning with ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956), and continuing with (among others) ''[[Brothers in Law (film)|Brothers in Law]]'' (1957), ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'' (1958), and ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959).\n\nPopular comedy series included the \"Doctor\" series, beginning with ''[[Doctor in the House]]'' (1954). The series originally starred [[Dirk Bogarde]], probably the British industry's most popular star of the 1950s, though later films had [[Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig]] and [[Leslie Phillips]] in leading roles. The [[Carry On (film series)|Carry On series]] began in 1958 with regular instalments appearing for the next twenty years. The Italian director-producer [[Mario Zampi]] also made a number of successful [[black comedy|black comedies]], including ''[[Laughter in Paradise]]'' (1951), ''[[The Naked Truth (1957 film)|The Naked Truth]]'' (1957) and ''[[Too Many Crooks]]'' (1958). [[Ealing Studios]] had continued its run of successful comedies, including ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), but the company ceased production in 1958, after the studios had already been bought by the [[BBC]].\n\n[[File:Dracula 1958 a.jpg|thumb|Dracula 1958 a|[[Christopher Lee]] in ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958).]]\nLess restrictive censorship towards the end of the 1950s encouraged B-film producer [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] to embark on their series of commercially successful horror films. Beginning with adaptations of [[Nigel Kneale]]'s [[BBC]] [[science fiction television|science fiction serials]] ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' (1955) and ''[[Quatermass II]]'' (1957), Hammer quickly graduated to ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957) and  ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958), both deceptively lavish and the first gothic horror films in colour. The studio turned out numerous sequels and variants, with English actors [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Christopher Lee]] being the most regular leads. ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960), a now highly regarded thriller, with horror elements, set in the contemporary period, was badly received by the critics at the time, and effectively finished the career of Michael Powell, its director.\n\n===Social realism===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0710-0009-013, Karlsbad, Filmfestival, Beyer, Reiss, Brousil.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Karel Reisz]] (centre)  who was active in the [[Free Cinema]] and the 'British New Wave']]\nThe [[British New Wave]] film makers attempted to produce [[social realism|social realist]] films (see also '[[kitchen sink realism]]') attempted in commercial feature films released between around 1959 and 1963 to convey narratives about a wider spectrum of people in Britain than the country's earlier films had done. These individuals, principally [[Karel Reisz]], [[Lindsay Anderson]] and [[Tony Richardson]], were also involved in the short lived Oxford film journal ''[[Sequence (journal)|Sequence]]'' and the \"[[Free Cinema]]\" documentary film movement. The 1956 statement of Free Cinema, the name was coined by Anderson, asserted: \"No film can be too personal. The image speaks. Sounds amplifies and comments. Size is irrelevant. Perfection is not an aim. An attitude means a style. A style means an attitude.\" Anderson, in particular, was dismissive of the commercial film industry. Their documentary films included Anderson's ''[[Every Day Except Christmas]]'', among several sponsored by [[Ford of Britain]], and Richardson's ''[[Momma Don't Allow]]''. Another member of this group, [[John Schlesinger]], made documentaries for the BBC's ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'' arts series.\n\nTogether with future James Bond co-producer [[Harry Saltzman]], dramatist [[John Osborne]] and Tony Richardson established the company Woodfall Films to produce their early feature films. These included adaptations of Richardson's stage productions of Osborne's ''[[Look Back in Anger (1959 film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), with [[Richard Burton]], and ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960) with [[Laurence Olivier]], both from Osborne's own screenplays. Such films as Reisz's ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (also 1960), Richardson's ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961), Schlesinger's ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962) and ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' (1963), and Anderson's ''[[This Sporting Life]]'' (1963) are often associated with a new openness about working-class life or previously taboo issues.\n\nThe team of [[Basil Dearden]] and [[Michael Relph]], from an earlier generation, \"probe[d] into the social issues that now confronted social stability and the establishment of the promised peacetime consensus\".<ref name=\"O'Sullivan\">Tim O'Sullivan, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/456049/index.html \"Dearden, Basil (1911-1971)\"], BFI screenonline, citing the ''Reference Guide to British and Irish Film Directors''.</ref> ''[[Pool of London (film)|Pool of London]]'' (1950).<ref>Carl Daniels, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/475521/index.html \"Pool of London (1950)\"], BFI screenonline.</ref> and ''[[Sapphire (film)|Sapphire]]'' (1959) were early attempts to create narratives about racial tensions and an emerging multi-cultural Britain.<ref>Ann Ogidi, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/440288/ \"Sapphire (1959)\"], BFI screenonline.</ref> Dearden and Relph's ''[[Victim (1961 film)|Victim]]'' (1961), was about the blackmail of homosexuals.

Films like ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It]]'' (both 1965), ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (both 1966), all explored this phenomenon. ''[[Blowup]]'' (also 1966), and later ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969), showed female and then male full-frontal nudity on screen in mainstream British films for the first time.\n\nAt the same time, film producers Harry Saltzman and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] combined sex with exotic locations, casual violence and self-referential humour in the phenomenally successful [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] series with [[Sean Connery]] in the leading role. The first film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) was a [[sleeper hit]] in the UK and the second, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), a hit worldwide. By the time of the third film, ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), the series had become a global phenomenon, reaching its commercial peak with ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' the following year. The series' success led to a [[spy film]] boom with many Bond imitations. Bond co-producer Saltzman also instigated a rival series of more realistic spy films based on the novels of [[Len Deighton]]. [[Michael Caine]] starred as bespectacled spy [[Harry Palmer]] in ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'' (1965), and two sequels in the next few years. Other more downbeat espionage films were adapted from [[John le Carr\u00e9]] novels, such as ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'' (1966).\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - The War Room.png|right|thumb|The war room in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1963) was designed by [[Ken Adam]]]]\nAmerican directors were regularly working in London throughout the decade, but several became permanent residents in the UK. Blacklisted in America, [[Joseph Losey]] had a significant influence on British cinema in the 1960s, particularly with his collaborations with playwright [[Harold Pinter]] and leading man [[Dirk Bogarde]], including ''[[The Servant (1963 film)|The Servant]]'' (1963) and ''[[Accident (1967 film)|Accident]]'' (1967). Voluntary exiles [[Richard Lester]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]] were also active in the UK. Lester had major hits with [[The Beatles]] film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It]]'' (1965) while Kubrick's ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1963) and  ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). While Kubrick settled in [[Hertfordshire]] in the early 1960s and would remain in England for the rest of his career, these two films retained a strong American influence. Other films of this era involved prominent filmmakers from elsewhere in Europe, ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''Blowup'' (1966) were the first English language films of the  Polish director [[Roman Polanski]] and the Italian [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] respectively.\n\nHistorical films as diverse as ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'' (1963), and ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966) benefited from the investment of American studios. Major films like ''[[Becket (1964 film)|Becket]]'' (1964), ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1968) were regularly mounted, while smaller-scale films, including ''[[Accident (1967 film)|Accident]]'' (1967), were big critical successes. Four of the decade's [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners for best picture were British productions, including six [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for the film musical ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' (1968), based on the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.\n\nAfter directing several contributions to the BBC's ''[[The Wednesday Play|Wednesday Play]]'' anthology series, [[Ken Loach]] began his feature film career with the social realist ''[[Poor Cow]]'' (1967) and ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' (1969). Meanwhile, the controversy around [[Peter Watkins]] ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), which won the Best Documentary Film Oscar in 1967, but had been suppressed by the BBC who had commissioned it, would ultimately lead Watkins to work exclusively outside Britain.\n\n===1970 to 1980===\n[[File:Glenda Jackson.JPG|right|150px|thumb|[[Glenda Jackson]] in 1971.]]\nAmerican studios cut back on British productions, and in many cases withdrew from financing them altogether. Films financed by American interests were still being made, including [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970), but for a time funds became hard to come by.\n\nMore relaxed censorship also brought several controversial films, including [[Nicolas Roeg]] and [[Donald Cammell]]'s ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'', [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'' (1971), [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) starring [[Malcolm McDowell]] as the leader of a gang of thugs in a [[dystopia]]n future Britain.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/100britishfilms/film.asp?film=11 \"The 100 Best British Films Ever\"].

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] returned to Britain to shoot ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), Other productions such as [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Young Winston]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977) met with mixed commercial success. The British [[horror film]] cycle associated with Hammer Film Productions, [[Amicus Productions|Amicus]] and [[Tigon British Film Productions|Tigon]] drew to a close, despite attempts by Hammer to spice up the formula with added nudity and gore. Although some attempts were made to broaden the range of British horror films, such as with ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' (1973), these films made little impact at the box office, In 1976, British Lion, who produced ''The Wicker Man'', were finally absorbed into the film division of [[EMI Films|EMI]], who had taken over ABPC in 1969. The duopoly in British cinema exhibition, via Rank and now EMI, continued.\n\n[[File:Sir Peter Ustinov Allan Warren.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Peter Ustinov]] (pictured in 1986) starred as [[Hercule Poirot]] in ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978)]]\nSome British producers, including Hammer, turned to television for inspiration, and big screen versions of popular sitcoms like ''[[On the Buses (film)|On the Buses]]'' (1971) and ''[[Steptoe and Son (film)|Steptoe and Son]]'' (1972) proved successful with domestic audiences, the former had greater domestic box office returns in its year than the Bond film, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. Low-budget British [[sex comedy|sex comedies]] included the ''Confessions of&nbsp;...'' series starring [[Robin Askwith]], beginning with ''[[Confessions of a Window Cleaner]]'' (1974). More elevated comedy films came from the [[Monty Python]] team, also from television. Their two most successful films were ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), the latter a major commercial success, probably at least in part due to the controversy at the time surrounding its subject.\n\nSome American productions did return to the major British studios in 1977\u201379, including the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) at [[Elstree Studios]], ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) at [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]], and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) at [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton]]. Successful adaptations were made in the decade of the [[Agatha Christie]] novels ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974) and ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978). The entry of [[Lew Grade]]'s company [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] into film production in the latter half of the decade brought only a few box office successes and an unsustainable number of failures\n\n===1980 to 1990===\n[[File:Richard Attenborough.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Richard Attenborough]] in 1983.]]\nIn 1980, only 31 British films were made,<ref name=\"FF12-03\"/> a 50% decline from the previous year and the lowest number since 1914, and production fell again in 1981 to 24 films.<ref name=\"FF12-03\"/> The industry suffered further blows from falling cinema attendances, which reached a record low in 1984, and the elimination of the 1957 [[Eady Levy]], a tax concession, in the same year.

M. Forster]], such as ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room with a View]]'' (1986). But further attempts to make 'big' productions for the US market ended in failure, with Goldcrest losing its independence after ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' (1985) and ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986) were commercial and critical flops. Another Goldcrest film, [[Roland Joff\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' (also 1986), won the 1986 [[Palme d'Or]], but did not go into profit either. Joff\u00e9's earlier ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984) had been both a critical and financial success. These were Joff\u00e9's first two feature films and were amongst those produced by Puttnam.\n\nMainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s. [[Horace Ov\u00e9]]'s ''[[Pressure (film)|Pressure]]'' (1975) had been funded by the [[British Film Institute]] as was ''[[A Private Enterprise]]'' (1974), these being the first [[Black British]] and [[Asian British]] films, respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as [[Franco Rosso]]'s ''[[Babylon (film)|Babylon]]'' (1980), [[Menelik Shabazz]]'s ''[[Burning an Illusion (1981)|Burning an Illusion]]'' (1981) and [[Po-Chih Leong]]'s ''[[Ping Pong (1986 film)|Ping Pong]]'' (1986; one of the first films about Britain's Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed [[Channel 4]], which had an official remit to provide for \"minority audiences.\" Commercial success was first achieved with ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'' (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from [[Hanif Kureishi]]'s first film script. ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' features [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] in a leading role. Day-Lewis and other young British actors who were becoming stars, such as [[Gary Oldman]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Tim Roth]] and [[Rupert Everett]], were dubbed the [[Brit Pack (actors)|Brit Pack]].<ref>Stern, Marlow.

[[John Boorman]], who had been working in the US, was encouraged back to the UK to make ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987). Channel Four also became a major sponsor of the British Film Institute's Production Board, which backed three of Britain's most critically acclaimed filmmakers: [[Derek Jarman]] (''[[The Last of England (film)|The Last of England]]'', 1987), [[Terence Davies]] (''[[Distant Voices, Still Lives]]'', 1988), and [[Peter Greenaway]]; the latter of whom gained surprising commercial success with ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'' (1989). [[Stephen Woolley]]'s company [[Palace Pictures]] also produced some successful films, including [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984) and ''[[Mona Lisa (1986 film)|Mona Lisa]]'' (1986), before collapsing amid a series of unsuccessful films. Amongst the other British films of the decade were [[Bill Forsyth]]'s ''[[Gregory's Girl]]'' (1981) and ''[[Local Hero]]'' (1983), [[Lewis Gilbert]]'s ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983), [[Peter Yates]]' ''[[The Dresser (1983 film)|The Dresser]]'' (1983) and [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' (1989).\n\n===1990 to 2000===\n[[File:Hugh Grant Cannes.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Hugh Grant]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\n\nCompared to the 1980s, investment in film production rose dramatically. In 1989, annual investment was a meagre \u00a3104 million. By 1996, this figure had soared to \u00a3741 million.<ref>Dyja, Eddie (ed.); 'BFI Film and Television Handbook 1999', London: BFI, 1998; p. 42.</ref> Nevertheless, the dependence on finance from television broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4 meant that budgets were often low and indigenous production was very fragmented: the film industry mostly relied on Hollywood inward investment. According to critic Neil Watson, it was hoped that the \u00a390 million apportioned by the new [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] into three franchises (The Film Consortium, Pathe Pictures, and DNA) would fill the gap, but \"corporate and equity finance for the UK film production industry continues to be thin on the ground and most production companies operating in the sector remain hopelessly under-capitalised.\"<ref>Watson, Neil, \"Hollywood UK\", in ''British Cinema of the 90s'', London: BFI Publishing, 2000, p. 82.</ref>\n\nThese problems were mostly compensated by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], a film studio whose British subsidiary [[Working Title Films]] released a [[Richard Curtis]]-scripted comedy ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994). It grossed $244 million worldwide and introduced [[Hugh Grant]] to global fame, led to renewed interest and investment in British films, and set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' (1998) and ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999). Other Working Titles films included ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' (1997), ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'' (1998) and ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin (film)|Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'' (2001). PFE was eventually sold and merged with [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999, the hopes and expectations of \"building a British-based company which could compete with Hollywood in its home market [had] eventually collapsed.\"<ref>Watson, \"Hollywood UK\", p. 83.</ref>\n\nTax incentives allowed American producers to increasingly invest in UK-based film production throughout the 1990s, including films such as ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996), ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998), ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999). Miramax also distributed [[Neil Jordan]]'s acclaimed thriller ''[[The Crying Game]]'' (1992), which was generally ignored on its initial release in the UK, but was a considerable success in the United States. The same company also enjoyed some success releasing the [[BBC]] period drama ''[[Enchanted April (1992 film)|Enchanted April]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Wings of the Dove (1997 film)|The Wings of the Dove]]'' (1997).\n\nAmong the more successful British films were the [[Merchant Ivory]] productions ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'' (1993), [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993), and [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s Shakespeare adaptations. ''[[The Madness of King George]]'' (1994) proved there was still a market for British [[costume drama]]s, and other period films followed, including ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), ''[[Restoration (1995 film)|Restoration]]'' (1995), ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' (1996), ''[[Mrs. Brown]]'' (1997), ''[[Basil (film)|Basil]]'' (1998), ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998) and ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'' (1999).\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus for legal reasons the [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] films returned to production with the 17th Bond film, ''[[GoldenEye]]''.

In 2006 Stephen Frears directed ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' based on the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana, which won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and Academy Awards and the BAFTA for Best Film. In 2006, Ken Loach won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival with his account of the struggle for Irish Independence in ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]''. [[Joe Wright]]'s adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'' was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film and won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Film. ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' was filmed entirely in Mumbai with a mostly Indian cast, though with a British director ([[Danny Boyle]]), producer ([[Christian Colson]]), screenwriter ([[Simon Beaufoy]]) and star (Dev Patel)\u2014the film was all-British financed via Film4 and Celador.  It has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has won four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards and eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film.  ''[[The King's Speech]]'', which tells the story of King [[George VI]]'s attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by [[Tom Hooper (director)|Tom Hooper]] and filmed almost entirely in London.  It received four Academy Awards (including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay) in 2011.\n\nThe start of the 21st century saw Asian British cinema assert itself at the box office, starting with ''[[East Is East (1999 film)|East Is East]]'' (1999) and continuing with ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002). Other notable British Asian films from this period include ''[[My Son the Fanatic]]'' (1997), ''[[Ae Fond Kiss...]] (2004)'', ''[[Mischief Night (2006 film)|Mischief Night]] (2006)'', ''[[Yasmin (2004 film)|Yasmin]]'' (2004) and ''[[Four Lions]]'' (2010). Some argue it has brought more flexible attitudes towards casting Black and Asian British actors, with [[Robbie Gee]] and [[Naomie Harris]] take leading roles in ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]'' respectively. The year 2005 saw the emergence of The [[British Urban Film Festival]], a timely addition to the film festival calendar, which recognised the influence of ''[[Kidulthood]]'' on UK audiences and consequently began to showcase a growing profile of films in a genre previously not otherwise regularly seen in the capital's cinemas. Then in 2005 ''[[Kidulthood]]'', a film centring on inner-city London youth had a limited release. This was successfully followed up with a sequel ''[[Adulthood (film)|Adulthood]]'' (2008) that was written and directed by actor [[Noel Clarke]]. Several other films dealing with inner city issues and Black Britons were released in the 2000s such as ''[[Bullet Boy]]'' (2004), ''[[Life and Lyrics]]'' (2006) and ''[[Rollin' with the Nines]]'' (2009).\n\nLike the 1960s, this decade saw plenty of British films directed by imported talent. The American [[Woody Allen]] shot ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jan/06/1|title=Match Point|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Peter Bradshaw|work=The Guardian| date=6 January 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/12/28/movies/28matc.html|title=London Calling, With Luck, Lust and Ambition |accessdate=29 June 2012|work=The New York Times| date=28 December 2005}}</ref> and three later films in London. The Mexican director [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] helmed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004) and ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006); New Zealand filmmaker [[Jane Campion]] made ''[[Bright Star (film)|Bright Star]]'' (2009), a film set in 19th century London; Danish director [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] made ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]'' (2008), a biopic about the English criminal [[Michael Gordon Peterson]]; the Spanish filmmaker [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] directed ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' (2007), a sequel to a British horror film; and two [[John le Carr\u00e9]] adaptations were also directed by foreigners\u2014''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' by the Brazilian [[Fernando Meirelles]] and ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'' by the Swedish [[Tomas Alfredson]]. The decade also saw English actor [[Daniel Craig]] became the new James Bond with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', the 21st entry in the official Eon Productions series.\n\nDespite increasing competition from film studios in Australia and Eastern Europe, British studios such as [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]], [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton]] and [[Leavesden Film Studios|Leavesden]] remained successful in hosting major productions, including ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'', ''[[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'',  ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]''  and ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]''.\n\nIn November 2010, [[Warner Bros.]] completed the acquisition of [[Warner Bros.

Just as the British Film Commission has played a crucial role in attracting the biggest and best international studios to produce their films here, so we must incentivise UK producers to chase new markets both here and overseas.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-uk-film-industry/|title=PM backs 'dynamic and entrepreneurial' UK film industry|date=11 January 2012|publisher=Number 10|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film industry remains an important earner for the British economy. According to a UK Film Council press release of 20 January 2011, \u00a31.115 billion was spent on UK film production during 2010. A 2014 survey suggested that British-made films were generally more highly rated than Hollywood productions, especially when considering low-budget UK productions.\n\n==Art cinema==\nAlthough it had been funding British experimental films as early as 1952, the [[British Film Institute]]'s foundation of a production board in 1964\u2014and a substantial increase in public funding from 1971 onwards\u2014enabled it to become a dominant force in developing British art cinema in the 1970s and 80s: from the first of [[Bill Douglas]]'s Trilogy ''My Childhood'' (1972), and of [[Terence Davies]]' Trilogy ''Childhood'' (1978), via [[Peter Greenaway]]'s earliest films (including the surprising commercial success of ''The Draughtsman's Contract'' (1982)) and [[Derek Jarman]]'s championing of the New Queer Cinema. The first full-length feature produced under the BFI's new scheme was [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[Andrew Mollo]]'s ''Winstanley'' (1975), while others included ''Moon Over the Alley'' (1975), ''Requiem for a Village'' (1975), the openly avant-garde ''Central Bazaar'' (1973), ''[[Pressure (film)|Pressure]]'' (1975) and ''A Private Enterprise'' (1974) -- the last two being, respectively, the first British Black and Asian features.\n\nThe release of Derek Jarman's ''[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]'' (1978) marked the beginning of a successful period of UK [[art film|art cinema]], continuing into the 1980s with filmmakers like [[Sally Potter]]. Unlike the previous generation of British film makers who had broken into directing and production after careers in the theatre or on television, the Art Cinema Directors were mostly the products of Art Schools. Many of these filmmakers were championed in their early career by the [[London Film Makers Cooperative]] and their work was the subject of detailed theoretical analysis in the journal ''Screen Education''. Peter Greenaway was an early pioneer of the use of computer generated imagery blended with filmed footage and was also one of the first directors to film entirely on high definition video for a cinema release.\n\nWith the launch of [[Channel 4]] and its [[Film on Four]] commissioning strand, Art Cinema was promoted to a wider audience. However the Channel had a sharp change in its commissioning policy in the early 1990s and Greenaway and others were forced to seek European co-production financing.\n\n==Film technology==\n[[File:Vue cinema London 2011 2.jpg|thumb|right|Vue cinema, [[Leicester Square]].]]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, British studios established a reputation for great special effects in films such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), and ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989). Some of this reputation was founded on the core of talent brought together for the filming of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) who subsequently worked together on series and feature films for [[Gerry Anderson]]. Thanks to the Bristol-based [[Aardman Animations]], the UK is still recognised as a world leader in the use of stop-motion animation.\n\nBritish special effects technicians and production designers are known for creating visual effects at a far lower cost than their counterparts in the US, as seen in ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981) and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985). This reputation has continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century with films such as the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] series, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) and the [[Harry Potter]] franchise.\n\nFrom the 1990s to the present day, there has been a progressive movement from traditional film opticals to an integrated [[digital film]] environment, with special effects, cutting, colour grading, and other post-production tasks all sharing the same all-digital infrastructure. The London-based [[visual effects]] company [[Framestore]], with [[Tim Webber]] the [[visual effects supervisor]], have worked on some of the most technically and artistically challenging projects, including, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008) and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), with new techniques involved in ''Gravity'' realized by Webber and the Framestore team taking three years to complete.<ref>Nick Roddick, [https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/tim-webber-the-man-who-put-sandra-bullock-in-space-8804917.html \"Tim Webber: the man who put Sandra Bullock in space\"], ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 17 September 2013. Retrieved 17 January 2014.</ref>\n\nThe availability of high-speed [[Internet Protocol]] networks has made the British film industry capable of working closely with U.S. studios as part of globally distributed productions. As of 2005, this trend is expected to continue with moves towards (currently experimental) digital distribution and projection as mainstream technologies. The British film ''[[This is Not a Love Song]]'' (2003) was the first to be [[stream]]ed live on the [[Internet]] at the same time as its cinema [[premiere]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[British Academy Film Awards]], hosted by the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], are the British equivalent of the [[Academy Awards]].<ref name=bbc260201/>\n* [[British Film Institute]]\n* [[Cinema of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Cinema of Scotland]]\n* [[Cinema of Wales]]\n* [[Cine-variety]]\n* [[Hollywood and the United Kingdom]] \u2013 British source material in American films, US studio subsidiaries in the UK, etc.\n* [[List of British films]]\n* [[List of British actresses]]\n* [[List of British film directors]]\n* [[List of British film studios]]\n* [[List of cinema of the world]]\n** [[Cinema of Europe]]\n* [[London in film]]\n* [[National Film and Television School]]\n* [[World cinema]]\n* [[:Category:Cinema chains in the United Kingdom|UK cinema chains]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;General\n\n* Aldgate, Anthony and Richards Jeffrey. 2002.

Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings.\n\n==History==\nThe development of feminist film theory was influenced by [[second wave feminism]] and [[women's studies]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially in the United States in the early 1970s feminist film theory was generally based on [[sociological theory]] and focused on the function of female characters in film [[narrative]]s or [[genre]]s. Feminist film theory, such as Marjorie Rosen\u2019s ''Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream'' (1973) and [[Molly Haskell]]\u2019s ''From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in Movies'' (1974) analyze the ways in which women are portrayed in film, and how this relates to a broader historical context. Additionally, feminist critiques also examine common [[stereotype]]s depicted in film, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.<ref>Smelik, Anneke.  \"And The Mirror Cracked: Feminist Cinema and Film Theory.\"New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998. Page 7-8.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, film theoreticians in England concerned themselves with [[critical theory]], [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalysis]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marxism]]. Eventually, these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the 1980's. Analysis generally focused on the meaning within a film's text and the way in which the text constructs a viewing subject.

''Visual Pleasure'' is one of the first major essays that helped shift the orientation of [[film theory]] towards a [[Psychoanalytical film theory|psychoanalytic framework]]. Prior to Mulvey, film theorists such as Jean-Louis Baudry and [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] used [[psychoanalytic]] ideas in their theoretical accounts of cinema. Mulvey's contribution, however, initiated the intersection of [[film theory]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[feminism]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21118050|title=Issues in feminist film criticism|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Erens, Patricia, 1938-|isbn=0253206103|location=Bloomington|oclc=21118050}}</ref>\n\nOther key influences come from [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] in his essay ''The Imaginary Signifier'', \"Identification, Mirror,\" where he argues that viewing film is only possible through [[scopophilia]] (pleasure from looking, related to [[voyeurism]]), which is best exemplified in silent film.<ref>Braudy and Cohen, ''Film Theory and Criticism'', Sixth Edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, page 827</ref> Also, according to Cynthia A.

The film journal ''Jump Cut'' published a special issue about titled ''Lesbians and Film'' in 1981 which examined the lack of lesbian identities in film. Jane Gaines's essay \"White Privilege and Looking Relations: Race and Gender in Feminist Film Theory\" examined the erasure of black women in cinema by white male filmmakers. While Lola Young argues that filmmakers of all races fail to break away from the use to tired stereotypes when depicting black women.

Additionally, they have begun to explore notions of difference, engaging in dialogue about the differences among women (part of movement away from [[essentialism]] in feminist work more generally), the various methodologies and perspectives contained under the umbrella of feminist film theory, and the multiplicity of methods and intended effects that influence the development of films. Scholars are also taking increasingly global perspectives, responding to [[postcolonialism|postcolonialist]] criticisms of perceived Anglo- and [[Eurocentrism]] in the academy more generally. Increased focus has been given to, \"disparate feminisms, nationalisms, and media in various locations and across class, racial, and ethnic groups throughout the world\".<ref>McHugh, Kathleen and Vivian Sobchack. \u201cIntroduction: Recent Approaches to Film Feminisms.\u201d ''Signs'' 30(1):1205\u20131207.</ref>\n\n==Key themes==\n===The gaze and the female spectator===\n\nConsidering the way that films are put together, many feminist film critics have pointed to what they argue is the \"[[male gaze]]\" that predominates [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] filmmaking. [[Budd Boetticher]] summarizes the view:\n:\"What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself, the woman has not the slightest importance.\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|title=Issues in Feminist Film Criticism|author=Erens, P.|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253319647|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2U0wwTFVwgC|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>{{rp|28}}\n[[Laura Mulvey]] expands on this conception to argue that in cinema, women are typically depicted in a passive role that provides visual pleasure through scopophilia,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>{{rp|30}} and identification with the on-screen male actor.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>{{rp|28}}  She asserts: \"In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote ''to-be-looked-at-ness'',\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>{{rp|28}} and as a result contends that in film a woman is the \"bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning.\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>{{rp|28}} Mulvey argues that the psychoanalytic theory of [[Jacques Lacan]] is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual [[objectification]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] through the combination of the [[patriarchal]] order of society, and 'looking' in itself as a pleasurable act of scopophilia, as \"the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking.\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nWhile Laura Mulvey's paper has a particular place in the feminist film theory, it is important to note that her ideas regarding ways of watching the cinema (from the voyeuristic element to the feelings of identification) are important to some feminist film theorists in terms of defining spectatorship from the psychoanalytical viewpoint.\n\nMulvey identifies three \"looks\" or perspectives that occur in film which, she argues, serve to sexually objectify women. The first is the perspective of the male character and how he perceives the female character. The second is the perspective of the spectator as they see the female character on screen. The third \"look\" joins the first two looks together: it is the male audience member's perspective of the male character in the film. This third perspective allows the male audience to take the female character as his own personal sex object because he can relate himself, through looking, to the male character in the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>{{rp|28}}\n\nIn the paper, Mulvey calls for a destruction of modern film structure as the only way to free women from their sexual objectification in film. She argues for a removal of the voyeurism encoded into film by creating distance between the male spectator and the female character. The only way to do so, Mulvey argues, is by destroying the element of voyeurism and \"the invisible guest\". Mulvey also asserts that the dominance men embody is only so because women exist, as without a woman for comparison, a man and his supremacy as the controller of visual pleasure are insignificant. For Mulvey, it is the presence of the female that defines the patriarchal order of society as well as the male psychology of thought.<ref name=\"books.google.com\" />\n\nMulvey's argument is likely influenced by the time period in which she was writing. \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" was composed during the period of [[second-wave feminism]], which was concerned with achieving equality for women in the workplace, and with exploring the psychological implications of sexual stereotypes. Mulvey calls for an eradication of female sexual objectivity, aligning herself with second-wave feminism. She argues that in order for women to be equally represented in the workplace, women must be portrayed as men are: as lacking sexual objectification.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMulvey proposes in her notes to the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD of [[Michael Powell]]'s controversial film, ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (a film about a homicidal voyeur who films the deaths of his victims), that the cinema spectator\u2019s own voyeurism is made shockingly obvious and even more shockingly, the spectator identifies with the perverted protagonist. The inference is that she includes female spectators in that, identifying with the male observer rather than the female object of the gaze.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/65-peeping-tom\n|title=Peeping Tom\n|author=Laura Mulvey\n|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}\n</ref>\n\n===Realism and counter cinema===\n\nThe early work of Marjorie Rosen and Molly Haskell on the representation of women in film was part of a movement to depict women more realistically, both in documentaries and narrative cinema. The growing female presence in the film industry was seen as a positive step toward realizing this goal, by drawing attention to feminist issues and putting forth an alternative, true-to-life view of women. However, Rosen and Haskell argue that these images are still mediated by the same factors as traditional film, such as the \"moving camera, composition, editing, lighting, and all varieties of sound.\"  While acknowledging the value in inserting positive representations of women in film, some critics asserted that real change would only come about from reconsidering the role of film in society, often from a semiotic point of view.<ref>Erens, Patricia. \u201cIntroduction\u201d ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xviii.</ref>\n\n[[Claire Johnston]] put forth the idea that [[women's cinema]] can function as \"counter cinema.\" Through consciousness of the means of production and opposition of sexist ideologies, films made by women have the potential to posit an alternative to traditional Hollywood films.<ref>Johnston, Claire. \"Women\u2019s Cinema as Counter Cinema.\"  ''Sexual Stratagems: The World of Women in Film.'' Patricia Erens, ed. New York: Horizon Press, 1979, pp 133\u2013143.</ref> Initially, the attempt to show \"real\" women was praised, eventually critics such as Eileen McGarry claimed that the \"real\" women being shown on screen were still just contrived depictions.  In reaction to this article, many women filmmakers integrated \"alternative forms and experimental techniques\" to \"encourage audiences to critique the seemingly transparent images on the screen and to question the manipulative techniques of filming and editing\".<ref>Erens, Patricia. \u201cIntroduction\u201d ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xix.</ref>\n\n=== Additional theories ===\n[[B. Ruby Rich]] argues that feminist film theory should shift to look at films in a broader sense. Rich's essay ''In the Name of Feminist Film Criticism'' claims that films by women often receive praise for certain elements, while feminist undertones are ignored. Rich goes on to say that because of this feminist theory needs to focus on how film by women are being received.<ref>Rich, B. Ruby. \u201cIn the Name of Feminist Film Criticism. ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990, pp. 268\u2013287.</ref>\n\nComing from a black feminist perspective, American scholar, Bell Hooks, put forth the notion of the \u201coppositional gaze,\u201d encouraging black women not to accept stereotypical representations in film, but rather actively critique them. The \u201coppositional gaze\u201d is a response to Mulvey's ''visual pleasure'' and states that just as women do not identify with female characters that are not \"real,\" women of color should respond similarly to the one denominational caricatures of black women.<ref>hooks, bell. \u201cThe Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators.\u201d  ''The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader.''

Clover further argues that the \"[[Final Girl]]\" in the psychosexual subgenre of exploitation horror invariably triumphs through her own resourcefulness, and is not by any means a passive, or inevitable, victim. Laura Mulvey, in response to these and other criticisms, revisited the topic in \"Afterthoughts on 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' inspired by ''Duel in the Sun''\" (1981). In addressing the heterosexual female spectator, she revised her stance to argue that women can take two possible roles in relation to film: a masochistic identification with the female object of desire that is ultimately self-defeating or a transsexual identification with men as the active viewers of the text.<ref name=\"Erens, Patricia 1990\"/> A new version of the gaze was offered in the early 1990s by [[Bracha Ettinger]], who proposed the notion of the \"[[matrixial gaze]]\".\n\n==List of notable feminist film theorists and critics==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Carol J.

This approach was proposed by [[Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg]], [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]].<ref>[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part I.</ref> Today, it is a major theory of film study.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]], at its most general, considers the synthesis (or lack of synthesis) of the multiple elements of film production, and the effects, emotional and intellectual, of that synthesis and of the individual elements.  For example, take the single element of editing. A formalist might study how standard [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] \"[[continuity editing]]\" creates a more comforting effect and non-continuity or [[jump cut]] editing might become more disconcerting or volatile.\n\nOr one might consider the synthesis of several elements, such as editing, shot composition, and music. The shoot-out that ends [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Spaghetti Western]] [[Dollars Trilogy|\"Dollars\" trilogy]] is a notable example of how these elements work together to produce an effect: The shot selection goes from very wide to very close and tense; the length of shots decreases as the sequence progresses towards its end; the music builds. All of these elements, in combination rather than individually, create tension. \n\nFormalism is unique in that it embraces both ideological and auteurist branches of criticism. In both these cases, the common denominator for Formalist criticism is style. Ideologues focus on how socio-economic pressures create a particular style, and auteurists on how auteurs put their own stamp on the material. Formalism is primarily concerned with style and how it communicates ideas, emotions, and themes (rather than, as critics of formalism point out, concentrating on the themes of a work itself).\n\n== Ideological formalism ==\nTwo examples of ideological interpretations that are related to formalism:\n\nThe [[classical Hollywood cinema]] has a very distinct style, sometimes called the [[institutional mode of representation]]: continuity editing, massive coverage, [[three-point lighting]], \"mood\" music, dissolves, all designed to make the experience as pleasant as possible. The socio-economic ideological explanation for this is, quite crassly, that Hollywood wants to make as much money and appeal to as many ticket-buyers as possible.\n\n[[Film noir]], which was given its name by [[Nino Frank]], is marked by lower production values, darker images, under lighting, location shooting, and general nihilism: this is because, we are told, during the war and post-war years filmmakers (as well as filmgoers) were generally more pessimistic. Also, the German Expressionists (including [[Fritz Lang]], who was not technically an expressionist as popularly believed{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}) emigrated to America and brought their stylized lighting effects (and disillusionment due to the war) to American soil.\n\nIt can be argued that, by this approach, the style or 'language' of these films is directly affected not by the individuals responsible, but by social, economic, and political pressures, of which the filmmakers themselves may be aware or not. It is this branch of criticism that gives us such categories as the classical Hollywood cinema, the American independent movement, the New American independent movement, the new queer cinema, and the French, German, and Czech new waves.\n\n== Formalism in auteur theory ==\nIf the ideological approach is concerned with broad movements and the effects of the world around the filmmaker, then the [[auteur theory]] is diametrical to it, celebrating the individual, usually in the person of the filmmaker, and how his/her personal decisions, thoughts, and style manifest themselves in the material.\n\nThis branch of criticism, begun by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and the other young film critics writing for ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', was created for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it was created to redeem the art of film itself. By arguing that films had auteurs, or authors, Truffaut sought to make films (and their directors) at least as important as the more widely accepted art forms, such as literature, music, and painting. Each of these art forms, and the criticism thereof, is primarily concerned with a sole creative force: the author of a novel (not, for example, his editor or type-setter), the composer of a piece of music (though sometimes the performers are given credence, akin to actors in film today), or the painter of a fresco (not his assistants who mix the colours or often do some of the painting themselves). By elevating the director, and not the screenwriter, to the same importance as novelists, composers, or painters, it sought to free the cinema from its popular conception as a bastard art, somewhere between theater and literature.\n\nSecondly, it sought to redeem many filmmakers who were looked down upon by mainstream film critics. It argued that genre filmmakers and low-budget B-movies were just as important, if not more, than the prestige pictures commonly given more press and legitimacy in France and the United States. According to Truffaut's theory, auteurs took material that was beneath their talents\u2014a thriller, a pulpy action film, a romance\u2014and, through their style, put their own personal stamp on it.\n\nIt is this auteur style that concerns formalism.\n\nA perfect example of formalist criticism of auteur style would be the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Hitchcock primarily made thrillers, which, according to the ''Cahiers du cinema'' crowd, were popular with the public but were dismissed by the critics and the award ceremonies, although Hitchcock's ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1940 Academy Awards. Though he never won the Oscar for directing, he was nominated five times in the category. Truffaut and his colleagues argued that Hitchcock had a style as distinct as that of Flaubert or Van Gogh: the virtuoso editing, the lyrical camera movements, the droll humour. He also had \"Hitchcockian\" themes: the wrong man falsely accused, violence erupting at the times it was least expected, the cool blonde. Now, Hitchcock is more or less universally lauded, his films dissected shot-by-shot, his work celebrated as being that of a master. And the study of this style, his variations, and obsessions all fall quite neatly under the umbrella of formalist film theory.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Clement Greenberg]]\n* [[Clive Bell]]\n* [[Formalism (art)]]\n* [[Medium specificity]]\n* [[Neoformalism (film theory)]]\n* [[Russian formalism]]\n* [[Structuralist film theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[David Bordwell|Bordwell, David]], ''Film Art: An Introduction''; McGraw-Hill; 7th edition (June, 2003).\n* Braudy, Leo, ed., ''Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings''; Oxford University Press; 6th edition (March, 2004).\n* Gianetti, Louis, ''Understanding Movies''; Prentice Hall; 10th edition (March, 2004)\n\n{{Filmstudies}}\n\n[[Category:Film theory]]\n[[Category:Formalism (aesthetics)]]", "sha1": "shmg0jl92d4asnhv97m814o0m21erim"}}, {"title": "Film theory", "ns": "0", "id": "10799", "revision": {"id": "856872029", "parentid": "856870946", "timestamp": "2018-08-28T02:18:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Omnipaedista", "id": "8524693"}, "comment": "/* Further reading */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the YouTube series by Matthew Patrick|MatPat#The Film Theorists}}\n'''Film theory''' is a set of scholarly approaches within the [[academic]] [[discipline]] of '''cinema studies''' that questions the [[essentialism]] of [[film|cinema]] and provides conceptual frameworks for understanding [[film]]'s relationship to [[reality]], the other [[art]]s, individual viewers, and [[society]] at large. Film theory is not to be confused with general [[film criticism]], or [[film history]], though these three disciplines interrelate.\n\nAlthough film theory originated from [[linguistics]] and [[literary theory]],<ref>Pieter Jacobus Fourie (ed.), ''Media Studies: Content, audiences, and production'', Juta, 2001, p. 195.</ref> it also overlaps with the [[philosophy of film]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/film \"Philosophy of Film\" by Thomas Wartenberg - first published Aug. 18, 2004; substantive revision Nov. 25, 2008 - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].</ref>\n\n==History==\nFrench philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' (1896) has been cited as anticipating the development of film theory during the birth of cinema. Bergson commented on the need for new ways of thinking about movement, and coined the terms \"the movement-image\" and \"the time-image\". However, in his 1906 essay ''L'illusion cin\u00e9matographique'' (in ''L'\u00e9volution cr\u00e9atrice''; English: ''The cinematic illusion'') in ''Creative'', he rejects film as an exemplification of what he had in mind. Nonetheless, decades later, in ''[[Cinema 1|Cin\u00e9ma I]] and Cinema II'' (1983\u20131985), the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] took ''Matter and Memory'' as the basis of his [[philosophy of film]] and revisited Bergson's concepts, combining them with the [[semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].\n\nEarly film theory arose in the [[silent era]] and was mostly concerned with defining the crucial elements of the medium. It largely evolved from the works of directors like [[Germaine Dulac]], [[Louis Delluc]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Lev Kuleshov]], and [[Dziga Vertov]] and film theorists like [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]] and [[Siegfried Kracauer]].<ref>[[Robert Stam]], ''Film Theory: an introduction\", Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 2000.</ref> These thinkers emphasized how film differed from reality and how it might be considered a valid art form. In the years after [[World War II]], the French film critic and theorist [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] reacted against this approach to the cinema, arguing that film's essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its difference from reality.<ref>[[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]], ''What is Cinema?'' essays selected and translated by Hugh Gray, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, film theory took up residence in academia importing concepts from established disciplines like [[psychoanalysis]], [[gender studies]], [[anthropology]], [[literary theory]], [[semiotics]]  and [[linguistics]]. However, not until the late 1980s or early 1990s did film theory ''per se'' achieve much prominence in American universities by displacing the prevailing humanistic, [[auteur theory]] that had dominated cinema studies and which had been focused on the practical elements of film writing, production, editing and criticism.<ref name=\"Weddle\">Weddle, David. \"[http://articles.latimes.com/print/2003/jul/13/magazine/tm-filmschool28 Lights, Camera, Action.

Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a [[low-key lighting|low-key]], [[black-and-white]] visual style that has roots in [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] [[cinematography]]. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the [[hardboiled]] school of [[crime fiction]] that emerged in the United States during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nThe term ''film noir'', French for \"black film\" (literal) or \"dark film\" (closer meaning),<ref>See, e.g., Biesen (2005), p. 1; Hirsch (2001), p. 9; Lyons (2001), p. 2; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 1; Schatz (1981), p. 112. Outside the field of film noir scholarship, \"dark film\" is also offered on occasion; see, e.g., Block, Bruce A., ''The Visual Story: Seeing the Structure of Film, TV, and New Media'' (2001), p. 94; Klarer, Mario, ''An Introduction to Literary Studies'' (1999), p. 59.</ref> was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic [[Nino Frank]] in 1946, but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era.<ref>Naremore (2008), pp. 4, 15\u201316, 18, 41; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 4\u20135, 22, 255.</ref> Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively. Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s, many of the classic film noirs{{Ref label|A|a|none}} were referred to as \"[[melodrama]]s\". Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct [[film genre|genre]] is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars.\n\nFilm noir encompasses a range of plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]''), a [[Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes policeman]] (''[[The Big Heat]]''), an aging boxer (''[[The Set-Up (1949 film)|The Set-Up]]''), a hapless [[Confidence trick|grifter]] (''[[Night and the City]]''), a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime (''[[Gun Crazy]]''), or simply a victim of circumstance (''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]''). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, the term has been used to describe films from around the world. Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noirs of the classical period, and often treat its conventions [[Self-reference|self-referentially]]. Some refer to such latter-day works as [[neo-noir]]. The clich\u00e9s of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.\n\n==Problems of definition==\n[[File:The stranger (1946).webm|thumb|''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'', full film]]\nThe questions of what defines film noir, and what sort of category it is, provoke continuing debate.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 3.</ref> \"We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]], strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel&nbsp;...\"\u2014this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics [[:fr:Raymond Borde|Raymond Borde]] and \u00c9tienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book ''Panorama du film noir am\u00e9ricain 1941\u20131953'' (''A Panorama of American Film Noir''), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject.<ref>Borde and Chaumeton (2002), p. 2.</ref> They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure\u2014one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal.<ref>Borde and Chaumeton (2002), pp. 2\u20133.</ref> The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an \"elusive phenomenon&nbsp;... always just out of reach\".<ref>Bould (2005), p. 13.</ref>\n\nThough film noir is often identified with a visual style, unconventional within a Hollywood context, that emphasizes [[low-key lighting]] and [[Composition (visual arts)|unbalanced compositions]],<ref>See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4; Bould (2005), p. 12; Place and Peterson (1974).</ref> films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches, including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream.<ref>See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 167\u201368; Irwin (2006), p. 210.</ref> Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres, from the [[mob film|gangster film]] to the [[police procedural]] to the [[gothic fiction|gothic romance]] to the [[social problem film|social problem picture]]\u2014any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s, now seen as noir's classical era, was likely to be described as a melodrama at the time.<ref>Neale (2000), p. 166; Vernet (1993), p. 2; Naremore (2008), pp. 17, 122, 124, 140; Bould (2005), p. 19.</ref>\n\nWhile many critics refer to film noir as a genre itself, others argue that it can be no such thing.<ref>For overview of debate, see, e.g., Bould (2005), pp. 13\u201323; Telotte (1989), pp. 9\u201310.

For the opposing viewpoint, see, e.g., Neale (2000), p. 164; Ottoson (1981), p. 2; Schrader (1972); Durgnat (1970).</ref> Film noir is often associated with an urban setting, but many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the [[Western (genre)|Western]]. Similarly, while the [[private investigator|private eye]] and the [[femme fatale]] are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the [[horror film]], the speculative leaps of the [[science fiction film]], or the song-and-dance routines of the [[musical film|musical]].<ref>Ottoson (1981), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAn analogous case is that of the [[screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]], widely accepted by film historians as constituting a \"genre\": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some\u2014but rarely and perhaps never all\u2014of which are found in each of the genre's films.<ref>See Dancyger and Rush (2002), p. 68, for a detailed comparison of screwball comedy and film noir.</ref> Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a \"style\".<ref>Schatz (1981), pp. 111\u201315.</ref> [[Alain Silver]], the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a \"cycle\"<ref>Silver (1996), pp. 4, 6 passim.

The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of [[Nazism|Nazi]]sm, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who had been involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners.<ref>Bould (2005), pp. 24\u201333.</ref> ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), shot only a few years before director [[Fritz Lang]]'s departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the [[Sound film|sound era]] to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, [[Robert Siodmak]] and [[Michael Curtiz]] brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (''[[mise en sc\u00e8ne|mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]''), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 9\u201311.</ref>\n\nBy 1931, Curtiz had already been in Hollywood for half a decade, making as many as six films a year. Movies of his such as ''[[20,000 Years in Sing Sing]]'' (1932) and ''[[Private Detective 62]]'' (1933) are among the early Hollywood sound films arguably classifiable as noir\u2014scholar Marc Vernet offers the latter as evidence that dating the initiation of film noir to 1940 or any other year is \"arbitrary\".<ref>Vernet (1993), p. 15.</ref> Expressionism-orientated filmmakers had free stylistic rein in [[Universal Studios|Universal]] horror pictures such as ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932)\u2014the former [[cinematography|photographed]] and the latter directed by the Berlin-trained [[Karl Freund]]\u2014and ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), directed by Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Edgar G.

Edeson later photographed ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), widely regarded as the first major film noir of the classic era.<ref>Davis (2004), p. 194. See also Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 133; Ottoson (1981), pp. 110\u2013111. Vernet (1993) notes that the techniques now associated with Expressionism were evident in the American cinema from the mid-1910s (pp. 9\u201312).</ref>\n\n[[Josef von Sternberg]] was directing in Hollywood during the same period. Films of his such as ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Devil Is a Woman (1935 film)|The Devil Is a Woman]]'' (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]'' (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 6.</ref> Successful films in that genre such as ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931) and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 6\u20139; Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 323\u201324.</ref> An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French [[poetic realism]], with its romantic, [[fatalism|fatalistic]] attitude and celebration of doomed heroes.<ref>Spicer (2007), pp. 26, 28; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 13\u201315; Bould (2005), pp. 33\u201340.</ref> The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the [[Warner Bros.]] drama ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932), a forerunner of noir.<ref>McGarry (1980), p. 139.</ref> Among films not considered film noirs, perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), directed by [[Orson Welles]]. Its visual intricacy and complex, [[voiceover]] narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic film noirs.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 20; Schatz (1981), pp. 116\u201322; Ottoson (1981), p. 2.</ref>\n\n[[Italian neorealism]] of the 1940s, with its emphasis on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir. ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), directed by [[Billy Wilder]], another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American [[auteur]], tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism.<ref>Biesen (2005), p. 207.</ref> It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field.<ref>Naremore (2008), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Director [[Jules Dassin]] of ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use of location photography with non-professional extras. This [[semidocumentary]] approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'' (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.<ref>Krutnik, Neale, and Neve (2008), pp. 147\u2013148; Macek and Silver (1980), p. 135.</ref>\n\n===Literary sources===\n[[File:BlackMask1934Oct.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Magazine cover with illustration of a terrified-looking, red-haired young woman gagged and bound to a post.

Cain]] (whose ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' appeared five years later), and popularized in [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]''. The classic film noirs ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946), and ''[[Slightly Scarlet (1956 film)|Slightly Scarlet]]'' (1956; adapted from ''Love's Lovely Counterfeit''). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'' (1931), directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]] and photographed by [[Lee Garmes]], who worked regularly with Sternberg. Released the month before Lang's ''M'', ''City Streets'' has a claim to being the first major film noir; both its style and story had many noir characteristics.<ref>See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 6; Macek (1980), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>\n\n[[Raymond Chandler]], who debuted as a novelist with ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' in 1939, soon became the most famous author of the hardboiled school. Not only were Chandler's novels turned into major noirs\u2014''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944; adapted from ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]''), ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), and ''[[Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947)\u2014he was an important [[screenwriter]] in the genre as well, producing the scripts for ''Double Indemnity'', ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946), and ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951). Where Chandler, like Hammett, centered most of his novels and stories on the character of the private eye, Cain featured less heroic protagonists and focused more on psychological exposition than on crime solving;<ref>Irwin (2006), pp. 71, 95\u201396.</ref> the Cain approach has come to be identified with a subset of the hardboiled genre dubbed \"[[noir fiction]]\". For much of the 1940s, one of the most prolific and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was [[Cornell Woolrich]] (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer's published work provided the basis for more film noirs of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including ''[[Black Angel (1946 film)|Black Angel]]'' (1946), ''[[Deadline at Dawn]]'' (1946), and ''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' (1947).<ref>Irwin (2006), pp. 123\u201324, 129\u201330.</ref>\n\nAnother crucial literary source for film noir was [[William R. Burnett|W. R. Burnett]], whose first novel to be published was ''Little Caesar'', in 1929. It was turned into a hit for [[Warner Bros.]] in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for ''Scarface'', while ''[[The Beast of the City]]'' (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date.<ref>White (1980), p. 17.</ref> Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots\u2014his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as film noirs, including three of the most famous: ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), ''[[This Gun for Hire]]'' (1942), and ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950).<ref>Irwin (2006), pp. 97\u201398, 188\u201389.</ref>\n\n==Classic period==\n\n===Overview===\nThe 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the \"classic period\" of American ''film noir''. While ''City Streets'' and other pre-WWII crime melodramas such as ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936) and ''[[You Only Live Once (1937 film)|You Only Live Once]]'' (1937), both directed by Fritz Lang, are categorized as full-fledged ''noir'' in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward's ''film noir'' encyclopedia, other critics tend to describe them as \"proto-noir\" or in similar terms.<ref>Silver and Ward (1992), p.  333, as well as entries on individual films, pp. 59\u201360, 109\u201310, 320\u201321.

Although modestly budgeted, at the high end of the [[B movie]] scale, ''Stranger on the Third Floor'' still lost its studio, [[RKO]], US$56,000 ({{Inflation|US|56000|1940|fmt=eq}}), almost a third of its total cost.<ref>Biesen (2005), p. 33.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine found Ingster's work: \"...too studied and when original, lacks the flare to hold attention.

In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the [[Production Code]] ensured that no film character could literally get away with murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqu\u00e9 for the time.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4, 19\u201326, 28\u201333; Hirsch (2001), pp. 1\u201321; Schatz (1981), pp. 111\u201316.</ref>\n\n[[File:OutOfThePastMitchumGreer.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=Black-and-white image of a man and a woman sitting side by side on a couch, viewed at an angle.

The signal film in this vein was ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was [[Barbara Stanwyck]]'s unforgettable [[femme fatale]], Phyllis Dietrichson\u2014an apparent nod to [[Marlene Dietrich]], who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature all the way, the film's commercial success and seven [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs.<ref>See, e.g., Naremore (2008), pp. 81, 319 n. 13; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 86\u201388.</ref> A slew of now-renowned noir \"[[bad girl movies|bad girls]]\" followed, such as those played by [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), [[Lana Turner]] in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946), [[Ava Gardner]] in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946), and [[Jane Greer]] in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), with [[Humphrey Bogart]] as [[Sam Spade]], and ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944), with [[Dick Powell]] as [[Philip Marlowe]].\n\nThe prevalence of the private eye as a lead character declined in film noir of the 1950s, a period during which several critics describe the form as becoming more focused on extreme psychologies and more exaggerated in general.<ref>See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 30; Hirsch (2001), pp. 12, 202; Schrader (1972), pp. 59\u201361 [in Silver and Ursini].</ref> A prime example is ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955); based on a novel by [[Mickey Spillane]], the best-selling of all the hardboiled authors, here the protagonist is a private eye, [[Mike Hammer]].

They regard true film noir as belonging to a temporally and geographically limited cycle or period, treating subsequent films that evoke the classics as fundamentally different due to general shifts in filmmaking style and latter-day awareness of noir as a historical source for [[allusion]].<ref>See, e.g., Hirsch (2001), pp. 10, 202\u20137; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 6 (though they phrase their position more ambiguously on p. 398); Ottoson (1981), p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Directors and the business of noir===\n[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=Black-and-white image of a man and woman, both with downcast expressions, sitting side by side in the front seat of a convertible.

Debuting as a director with ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), [[John Huston]] followed with ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956).<ref>See, e.g., entries on individual films in Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 34, 190\u201392; Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 214\u201315; 253\u201354, 269\u201370, 318\u201319.</ref> [[Otto Preminger]]'s success with ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss [[20th Century-Fox]] presentation.<ref>Biesen (2005), p. 162.</ref> Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include ''[[Fallen Angel (1945 film)|Fallen Angel]]'' (1945), ''[[Whirlpool (1949 film)|Whirlpool]]'' (1949), ''[[Where the Sidewalk Ends (film)|Where the Sidewalk Ends]]'' (1950) (all for Fox) and ''[[Angel Face (1952 film)|Angel Face]]'' (1952). A half-decade after ''Double Indemnity'' and ''The Lost Weekend'', Billy Wilder made ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950) was [[Nicholas Ray]]'s breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1948) and ''[[On Dangerous Ground]]'' (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 188, 202\u20133.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lady from Shanghai trailer rita hayworth6.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rita Hayworth]] in the trailer for ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947).]]\nOrson Welles had notorious problems with financing but his three film noirs were well budgeted: ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947) received top-level, \"prestige\" backing, while ''The Stranger'', his most conventional film and ''Touch of Evil'', an unmistakably personal work, were funded at levels lower but still commensurate with headlining releases.<ref>For overview of Welles's noirs, see, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 210\u201311.

Lang's follow-up, ''[[Scarlet Street]]'' (1945), was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored: filled with erotic innuendo, it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee, Atlanta and New York State.<ref>Bernstein (1995).</ref> ''Scarlet Street'' was a semi-independent, cosponsored by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and Lang's Diana Productions, of which the film's co-star, [[Joan Bennett]], was the second biggest shareholder. Lang, Bennett and her husband, the Universal veteran and Diana production head [[Walter Wanger]], made ''[[Secret Beyond the Door]]'' (1948) in similar fashion.<ref>McGilligan (1997), pp. 314\u201317.</ref>\n\nBefore leaving the United States while subject to the [[Hollywood Blacklist]], Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major\u2013independent line: ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947) and the influential documentary-style ''[[The Naked City]]'' were developed by producer [[Mark Hellinger]], who had an \"inside/outside\" contract with Universal similar to Wanger's.<ref>Schatz (1998), pp. 354\u201358.</ref> Years earlier, working at Warner Bros., Hellinger had produced three films for [[Raoul Walsh]], the proto-noirs ''[[They Drive by Night]]'' (1940), ''[[Manpower (1941 film)|Manpower]]'' (1941) and ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), now regarded as a seminal work in noir's development.<ref>See, e.g., Schatz (1981), pp. 103, 112.</ref> Walsh had no great name during his half-century as a director but his noirs ''[[White Heat]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Enforcer (1951 film)|The Enforcer]]'' (1951) had A-list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle.<ref>See, e.g., entries on individual films in Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 97\u201398, 125\u201326, 311\u201312.</ref> Other directors associated with top-of-the-bill Hollywood film noirs include [[Edward Dmytryk]] (''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' [1944], ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' [1947])\u2014the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist\u2014as well as [[Henry Hathaway]] (''[[The Dark Corner]]'' [1946], ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'' [1947]) and [[John Farrow]] (''[[The Big Clock (1948 film)|The Big Clock]]'' [1948], ''[[Night Has a Thousand Eyes]]'' [1948]).\n\nMost of the Hollywood films considered to be classic noirs fall into the category of the \"[[B movie]]\".<ref>See Naremore (2008), pp. 140\u201355, on \"B Pictures versus Intermediates\".</ref> Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of [[double feature|double bills]] by a low-budget unit of one of the [[studio system|major studios]] or by one of the smaller [[Poverty Row]] outfits, from the relatively well-off [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]] to shakier ventures such as [[Producers Releasing Corporation|Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC)]]. [[Jacques Tourneur]] had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level ''Out of the Past'', described by scholar Robert Ottoson as \"the ''ne plus ultra'' of forties film noir\".<ref>Ottoson (1981), p. 132.</ref> Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as \"intermediates\" by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. [[Robert Wise]] (''[[Born to Kill (1947 film)|Born to Kill]]'' [1947], ''[[The Set-Up (1949 film)|The Set-Up]]'' [1949]) and [[Anthony Mann]] (''[[T-Men]]'' [1947] and ''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'' [1948]) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer [[John Alton]], a specialist in what James Naremore called \"hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness\".<ref>Naremore (2008), p. 173.</ref> ''[[He Walked by Night]]'' (1948), shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of \"[[police procedural]]\" crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]] company; it was the inspiration for the ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.<ref>Hayde (2001), pp. 3\u20134, 15\u201321, 37.</ref>\n[[File:DetourPoster1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Movie poster with a border of diagonal black and white bands.

[[Samuel Fuller]]'s brutal, visually energetic films such as ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953) and ''[[Underworld U.S.A.]]'' (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as \"primitive\" and \"barbarous\".<ref>Sarris (1985), p. 93.</ref><ref>Thomson (1998), p. 269.</ref> [[Joseph H.

Feist]] (''[[The Devil Thumbs a Ride]]'' [1947], ''[[Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951 American film)|Tomorrow Is Another Day]]'' [1951]), has become obscure. [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] spent most of his Hollywood career working at B studios and once in a while on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]''.<ref>See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 83\u201385; Ottoson (1981), pp. 60\u201361.</ref> Ulmer's other noirs include ''[[Strange Illusion]]'' (1945), also for PRC; ''[[Ruthless (film)|Ruthless]]'' (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and ''[[Murder Is My Beat]]'' (1955), for Allied Artists.\n\nA number of low- and modestly-budgeted noirs were made by independent, often actor-owned, companies contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, [[Hugo Haas]] made films like ''[[Pickup (film)|Pickup]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Other Woman (1954 film)|The Other Woman]]'' (1954). It was in this way that accomplished noir actress [[Ida Lupino]] established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s and much of the 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, ''[[The Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO.<ref>Muller (1998), pp. 176\u201377.</ref> It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Of the others, one was a small-studio release:  ''Detour''. Four were independent productions distributed by [[United Artists]], the \"studio without a studio\": ''Gun Crazy''; ''Kiss Me Deadly''; ''[[D.O.A. (1949 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950), directed by [[Rudolph Mat\u00e9]] and ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]]. One was an independent distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the industry leader: ''[[Force of Evil]]'' (1948), directed by [[Abraham Polonsky]] and starring [[John Garfield]], both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s.<ref>Krutnik, Neale, and Neve (2008), pp. 259\u201360, 262\u201363.</ref> Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but ''Sweet Smell of Success'', despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.<ref>See Mackendrick (2006), pp. 119\u201320.</ref>\n\nPerhaps no director better displayed that spirit than the German-born [[Robert Siodmak]], who had already made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann).<ref>See, e.g., Silver and Ward (1992), pp. 338\u201339. Ottoson (1981) also lists two period pieces directed by Siodmak (''[[The Suspect (1944 film)|The Suspect]]'' [1944] and ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' [1946]) (pp. 173\u201374, 164\u201365). Silver and Ward list nine classic-era film noirs by Lang, plus two from the 1930s (pp. 338, 396). Ottoson lists eight (excluding ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' [1956]), plus the same two from the 1930s (passim). Silver and Ward list seven by Mann (p. 338). Ottoson also lists ''[[Reign of Terror (film)|Reign of Terror]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Black Book''; 1949), set during the French Revolution, for a total of eight (passim). See also Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 241.</ref> In addition to ''The Killers'', [[Burt Lancaster]]'s debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's ''[[Phantom Lady (1944 film)|Phantom Lady]]'' (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled ''[[Christmas Holiday]]'' (1944), and ''[[Cry of the City]]'' (1948). ''[[Criss Cross (1949 film)|Criss Cross]]'' (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought the virtues of the B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In ''Criss Cross'', Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around [[Yvonne De Carlo]], playing the most understandable of femme fatales; [[Dan Duryea]], in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.<ref>Clarens (1980), pp. 200\u20132; Walker (1992), pp. 139\u201345; Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\n{|  style=\"width:94%; margin:auto; text-align:center; font-size:87%; clear:both;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n! style=\"background:#dbdaba; font-weight:normal; line-height:normal;\"| <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">'''Classic-era film noirs in the [[National Film Registry]]'''\n|-\n!  style=\"background-color:#fff; width:55px; background-color:#dbdaba; font-size:11px;\"|[[1940s in film|1940\u201349]]\n| style=\"background:#f5f5ec;\"|\n{{flatlist|\n*''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' \n*''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' \n*''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' \n*''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' \n*''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' \n*''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' \n*''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'' \n*''[[Gilda]]'' \n*''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' \n*''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' \n*''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' \n*''[[Out of the Past]]'' \n*''[[Force of Evil]]'' \n*''[[The Naked City]]'' \n*''[[White Heat]]''}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#dbdaba; font-size:11px;\"|[[1950s in film|1950\u201358]]\n| style=\"background:#f5f5ec;\"|\n{{flatlist|\n*''[[Gun Crazy]]'' \n*''[[D.O.A.

For instance, ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955), starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance, is treated as a film noir by some critics, but not by others.<ref>Treated as noir: Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 34; Hirsch (2001), pp. 59, 163\u201364, 168. Excluded from canon: Silver and Ward (1992), p. 330. Ignored: Bould (2005); Christopher (1998); Ottoson (1981).</ref> Some critics include ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in their catalogues of noir; others ignore it.<ref>Included: Bould (2005), p. 126; Ottoson (1981), p. 174. Ignored: Ballinger and Graydon (2007); Hirsch (2001); Christopher (1998). Also see Silver and Ward (1992): ignored in 1980; included in 1988 (pp. 392, 396).</ref> Concerning films made either before or after the classic period, or outside of the United States at any time, consensus is even rarer.\n\nTo support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion,<ref>See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4; Christopher (1998), p. 8.</ref> but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., ''Stranger on the Third Floor,'' ''The Big Sleep,'' ''Dark Passage,'' and ''The Dark Corner''), while the tone of many other noir [[denouement]]s is ambivalent.<ref>See, e.g., Ray (1985), p. 159.</ref> Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.<ref>Williams (2005), pp. 34\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Visual style===\n\nThe [[low-key lighting]] schemes of many classic film noirs are associated with stark light/dark [[contrast (vision)|contrasts]] and dramatic shadow patterning\u2014a style known as [[chiaroscuro]] (a term adopted from Renaissance painting).{{Ref label|C|c|none}} The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a [[clich\u00e9]] well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness\u2014a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945) and ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'' (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while ''[[Slightly Scarlet (1956 film)|Slightly Scarlet]]'' (1956), ''[[Party Girl (1958 film)|Party Girl]]'' (1958), and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.<ref>See Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 31, on general issue. Christopher (1998) and Silver and Ward (1992), for instance, include ''Slightly Scarlet'' and ''Party Girl'', but not ''Vertigo'', in their filmographies. By contrast, Hirsch (2001) describes ''Vertigo'' as among those Hitchcock films that are \"richly, demonstrably ''noir''\" (p. 139) and ignores both ''Slightly Scarlet'' and ''Party Girl''; Bould (2005) similarly includes ''Vertigo'' in his filmography, but not the other two. Ottoson (1981) includes none of the three in his canon.</ref>\n\nFilm noir is also known for its use of [[low-angle shot|low-angle]], [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle]], and [[Dutch angle|skewed, or Dutch angle]] shots. Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in ''Strangers on a Train''), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. [[Night-for-night]] shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of [[day-for-night]], was often employed.<ref>Place and Peterson (1974), p. 67.</ref> From the mid-1940s forward, [[location shooting]] became increasingly frequent in noir.<ref>Hirsch (2001), p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn an analysis of the visual approach of ''Kiss Me Deadly'', a late and self-consciously stylized example of classic noir, critic Alain Silver describes how cinematographic choices emphasize the story's themes and mood. In one scene, the characters, seen through a \"confusion of angular shapes\", thus appear \"caught in a tangible vortex or enclosed in a trap.\" Silver makes a case for how \"side light is used&nbsp;... to reflect character ambivalence\", while shots of characters in which they are lit from below \"conform to a convention of visual expression which associates shadows cast upward of the face with the unnatural and ominous\".<ref>Silver (1995), pp. 219, 222.</ref>\n\n===Structure and narrational devices===\n[[File:SorryWrongNumber2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A man and a woman, seen in profile, starring intensely at each other. The man, on the left, is considerably taller. He wears a brown pin-striped suit, holds a key in one hand and grips the woman's arm with the other. She is wearing a pale green top. Lit from below and to the side, they cast bold, angled shadows on the wall behind them.|[[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[Burt Lancaster]] were two of the most prolific stars of classic noir. The complex structure of ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948) involves a real-time framing story, [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]], and flashbacks within flashbacks.<ref>Telotte (1989), pp. 74\u201387.</ref>]]\n\nFilm noirs tend to have unusually convoluted story lines, frequently involving [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]] and other editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the [[narrative]] sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came to be seen as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style.<ref>Neale (2000), pp. 166\u201367 n. 5.</ref> Neo-noirs as varied as ''The Element of Crime'' (surrealist), ''After Dark, My Sweet'' (retro), and ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.\n\nBold experiments in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: ''Lady in the Lake'', for example, is shot entirely from the [[Point of view shot|point of view]] of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] is seen only in mirrors.<ref>Telotte (1989), p. 106.</ref> ''[[The Chase (1946 film)|The Chase]]'' (1946) takes [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneirism]] and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''D.O.A.'' are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as ''Pulp Fiction'', ''Fight Club'', and ''Memento''.<ref>Rombes, Nicholas, ''New Punk Cinema'' (2005), pp. 131\u201336.</ref>\n\n===Plots, characters, and settings===\nCrime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation. A crime investigation\u2014by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur\u2014is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot. In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in [[heist film|heists]] or [[confidence trick|con games]], or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs. False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses. According to J. David Slocum, \"protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir.\"<ref>Slocum (2001), p. 160.</ref> [[Amnesia]] is fairly epidemic\u2014\"noir's version of the common cold\", in the words of film historian [[Lee Server]].<ref>Server (2006), p. 149.</ref>\n\n[[File:PursuedPoster.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white film poster with an image of a young man and woman holding each other. They are surrounded by an abstract, whirlpool-like image; the central arc of the thick black line that define it encircles their head.

The stars' names\u2014Teresa Wright and Robert Mitchum\u2014feature at the top of the whirlpool; the title and remainder of the credits are below.|By the late 1940s, the noir trend was leaving its mark on other genres. A prime example is the Western ''[[Pursued]]'' (1947), filled with psychosexual tensions and behavioral explanations derived from [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian theory]].<ref>Ottoson (1981), p. 143.</ref>]]\n\nFilm noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often [[fall guy]]s of one sort or another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as \"[[Social alienation|alienated]]\";<ref>See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 25; Lyons (2000), p. 10.</ref> in the words of Silver and Ward, \"filled with [[existentialism|existential]] bitterness\".<ref>Silver and Ward (1992), p. 6.</ref> Certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs\u2014hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid [[claims adjuster]]s, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant.<ref>See, e.g., Hirsch (2001), pp. 128, 150, 160, 213; Christopher (1998), pp. 4, 32, 75, 83, 116, 118, 128, 155.</ref> From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''The Big Sleep'', ''Out of the Past'', and ''Kiss Me Deadly''. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: ''Laura'', ''The Killers'', ''The Naked City'', and ''Touch of Evil''.\n\nFilm noir is often associated with an urban setting, and a few cities\u2014Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular\u2014are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a \"labyrinth\" or \"maze\".<ref>See, e.g., Hirsch (2001), p. 17; Christopher (1998), p. 17; Telotte (1989), p. 148.</ref> Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of film noirs take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants\u2014most famously the explosive conclusion of ''White Heat'', set at a chemical plant.<ref>Ballinger and Graydon (2007), pp. 217\u201318; Hirsch (2001), p. 64.</ref> In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always rains.<ref>See, e.g., Bould (2005), p. 18, on the critical establishment of this iconography, as well as p. 35; Hirsch (2001), p. 213; Christopher (1998), p. 7.</ref>\n\nA substantial trend within latter-day noir\u2014dubbed \"film soleil\" by critic [[D. K. Holm]]\u2014heads in precisely the opposite direction, with tales of deception, seduction, and corruption exploiting bright, sun-baked settings, stereotypically the desert or open water, to searing effect. Significant predecessors from the classic and early post-classic eras include ''The Lady from Shanghai''; the [[Robert Ryan]] vehicle ''[[Inferno (1953 film)|Inferno]]'' (1953); the French adaptation of [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', ''[[Plein Soleil|Plein soleil]]'' (''Purple Noon'' in the United States, more accurately rendered elsewhere as ''Blazing Sun'' or ''Full Sun''; 1960); and director Don Siegel's version of ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964). The tendency was at its peak during the late 1980s and 1990s, with films such as ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' (1989), ''[[After Dark, My Sweet]]'' (1990), ''[[The Hot Spot]]'' (1990), ''[[Delusion (1991 film)|Delusion]]'' (1991), ''[[Red Rock West]]'' (1993) and the television series ''[[Miami Vice]]''.<ref>Holm (2005), pp. 13\u201325 passim.</ref>\n\n===Worldview, morality, and tone===\n[[File:BigClinch.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white image of a man and a woman, seen from mid-chest up, their faces in profile, gazing into each other's eyes.

The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt.<ref>See, e.g., Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 4; Christopher (1998), pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era\u2014in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author [[Nicholas Christopher]]'s opinion, \"it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche.\"<ref>Christopher (1998), p. 37.</ref> Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the [[Red Scare]], are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.<ref>See, e.g., Muller (1998), p. 81, on analyses of the film; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 2.</ref>\n\nFilm noir is often said to be defined by \"moral ambiguity\",<ref>See, e.g., Naremore (2008), p. 163, on critical claims of moral ambiguity; Lyons (2000), pp. 14, 32.</ref> yet the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was ultimately rewarded and vice, in the absence of shame and redemption, severely punished (however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be). A substantial number of latter-day noirs flout such conventions: vice emerges triumphant in films as varied as the grim ''Chinatown'' and the ribald ''Hot Spot''.<ref>See Skoble (2006), pp. 41\u201348, for a survey of noir morality.</ref>\n\nThe tone of film noir is generally regarded as downbeat; some critics experience it as darker still\u2014\"overwhelmingly black\", according to Robert Ottoson.<ref>Ottoson (1981), p. 1.</ref> Influential critic (and filmmaker) Paul Schrader wrote in a seminal 1972 essay that \"''film noir'' is defined by tone\", a tone he seems to perceive as \"hopeless\".<ref>Schrader (1972), p. 54 [in Silver and Ursini]. For characterization of definitive tone as \"hopeless\", see pp. 53 (\"the tone more hopeless\") and 57 (\"a fatalistic, hopeless mood\").</ref> In describing the adaptation of ''Double Indemnity,'' noir analyst Foster Hirsch describes the \"requisite hopeless tone\" achieved by the filmmakers, which appears to characterize his view of noir as a whole.<ref>Hirsch (2001), p. 7. Hirsch subsequently states, \"In character types, ''mood'' [emphasis added], themes, and visual composition, ''Double Indemnity'' offer[s] a lexicon of ''noir'' stylistics\" (p. 8).</ref> On the other hand, definitive film noirs such as ''The Big Sleep'', ''The Lady from Shanghai'', ''Scarlet Street'' and ''Double Indemnity'' itself are famed for their hardboiled repartee, often imbued with sexual innuendo and self-reflexive humor.<ref>Sanders (2006), p. 100.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Film gris]]\n* [[Scandinavian noir]]\n* [[List of film noir titles]]\n* [[List of neo-noir titles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>{{Note label|A|a|none}} The plural forms of ''film noir'' in English include ''films noirs'' ([[English plurals#French compounds|derived from the French]]), ''films noir'', and ''film noirs''.

Received opinion has been that the easternmost (and last-discovered) Samoyed had separated first and the branching into Ugric and Finno-Permic took place later, but this reconstruction does not have strong support in the linguistic data.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate}}\n\nAttempts at [[historical linguistics|reconstructing]] a Proto-Finno-Ugric [[protolanguage]], a common ancestor of all [[Uralic languages]] except for the [[Samoyedic languages]], are largely indistinguishable from [[Proto-Uralic]], suggesting that Finno-Ugric might not be a historical grouping but a geographical one, with Samoyedic being distinct by lexical borrowing rather than actually being historically divergent. It has been proposed that the area in which Proto-Finno-Ugric was spoken reached between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Ural Mountains]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Campbell| first = Lyle| title = Historical linguistics: an introduction| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EjXrrOJhex8C&pg=PA405| year = 2004| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-53267-9| page = 405 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the main set of evidence for the genetic proposal of Proto-Finno-Ugric has come from vocabulary. A large amount of vocabulary (e.g. the numerals \"one\", \"three\", \"four\" and \"six\"; the body-part terms \"hand\", \"head\") is only reconstructed up to the Proto-Finno-Ugric level, and only words with a Samoyedic equivalent have been reconstructed for Proto-Uralic. That methodology has been criticised, as no coherent explanation other than inheritance has been presented for the origin of most of the Finno-Ugric vocabulary (though a small number has been explained as old loanwords from [[Proto-Indo-European]] or its immediate successors). \n\nThe Samoyedic group has undergone a longer period of independent development, and its divergent vocabulary could be caused by mechanisms of replacement such as [[language contact]]. (The Finno-Ugric group is usually dated to approximately 4000 years ago, the Samoyedic a little over 2000.) Proponents of the traditional binary division note, however, that the invocation of extensive contact influence on vocabulary is at odds with the grammatical conservatism of Samoyedic.\n\nThe consonant ''*\u0161'' ([[voiceless postalveolar fricative]], {{IPA|[\u0283]}}) has not been conclusively shown to occur in the traditional Proto-Uralic lexicon, but it is attested in some of the Proto-Finno-Ugric material. Another feature attested in the Finno-Ugric vocabulary is that ''*i'' now behaves as a neutral vowel with respect to front-back vowel harmony, and thus there are roots such as ''*niwa-'' \"to remove the hair from hides\".<ref name=\"PS\">{{cite book| last = Sammallahti| first = Pekka| title = The Uralic languages \u2013 Description, history and foreign influences| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TM2NQ78dP2wC&pg=PA492| year = 1988| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-07741-6| pages = 478\u2013554| chapter = Historical Phonology of the Uralic languages| editor = Denis, Sinor }}</ref>\n\nRegular [[sound change]]s proposed for this stage are few and remain open to interpretation.

On the other hand, with a projected time depth of only 3,000 to 4,000 years, the traditionally accepted Finno-Ugric grouping would be far younger than many major families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and would be about the same age as, for instance, the [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern]] subfamily of [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]]. But the grouping is far from transparent or securely established. The absence of early records is a major obstacle. As for the Finno-Ugric [[Urheimat]], most of what has been said about it is speculation.\n\nSome linguists criticizing the Finno-Ugric genetic proposal<ref>especially [[Angela Marcantonio]]</ref> also question the validity of the entire Uralic family, instead proposing a [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages|Ural\u2013Altaic hypothesis]], within which they believe Finno-Permic may be as distant from Ugric as from Turkic. However, this approach has been rejected by nearly all other specialists in Uralic linguistics.<ref>For refutations, see e.g. Aikio 2003; Bakr\u00f3-Nagy 2003, 2005; De Smit 2003; Georg 2003; Kallio 2004; Laakso 2004; Saarikivi 2004.</ref>\n\n==Common vocabulary==\n{{main|Wiktionary:en:Appendix:Swadesh lists for Finno-Ugric languages|Swadesh lists for Finno-Ugric languages}}\n\n===Loanwords===\nOne argument in favor of the Finno-Ugric grouping has come from [[loanword]]s. Several loans from the [[Indo-European languages]] are present in most or all of the Finno-Ugric languages, while being absent from Samoyedic; many others also must be for phonological reasons dated as quite old.\n\nAccording to H\u00e4kkinen (1983) the alleged Proto-Finno-Ugric loanwords are disproportionally well-represented in Hungarian and the Permic languages, and disproportionally poorly represented in the Ob-Ugric languages; hence it is possible that such words have been acquired by the languages only after the initial dissolution of the Uralic family into individual dialects, and that the scarcity of loanwords in Samoyedic results from its peripheric location.<ref>{{cite thesis|first=Kaisa|last=H\u00e4kkinen|year=1983|title=Suomen kielen vanhimmasta sanastosta ja sen tutkimisesta|language=Finnish|type=PhD|publisher=Turun yliopisto|ISBN=951-642-445-7}}</ref>\n\n===Numbers===\nThe [[number system]]s among the Finno-Ugric languages are particularly distinct from the Samoyedic languages: only the numerals \"2\" and \"5\" have cognates in Samoyedic, while also the numerals, \"1\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\", \"10\" are shared by all or most Finno-Ugric languages.\n\nBelow are the numbers 1 to 10 in several Finno-Ugric languages.

Three (Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians) inhabit independent nation-states, [[Hungary]], [[Finland]], and [[Estonia]], while the Mordvins have an autonomous [[Mordovia|Mordovian Republic]] within Russia. The traditional area of the indigenous [[Sami people]] is in Northern Fenno-Scandinavia and the [[Kola Peninsula]] in Northwest Russia and is known as [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]]. Some other Finno-Ugric peoples have autonomous republics in [[Russia]]: [[Karelians]] ([[Republic of Karelia]]), [[Komi peoples|Komi]] ([[Komi Republic]]), [[Udmurts]] ([[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]), [[Mari people|Mari]] ([[Mari El|Mari El Republic]]), and [[Mordvins]] ([[Moksha people|Moksha]] and [[Erzya people|Erzya]]; [[Mordovia|Republic of Mordovia]]). [[Khanty people|Khanty]] and [[Mansi people|Mansi]] peoples live in the [[Khanty\u2013Mansi Autonomous Okrug]] of Russia, while Komi-[[Permyaks]] live in [[Komi-Permyak Okrug]], which used to be an [[autonomous okrug]] of Russia, but today is a territory with special status within [[Perm Krai]].\n\n===Population genetics===\nThe linguistic reconstruction of the Finno-Ugric language family has led to the postulation that the ancient Proto\u2013Finno-Ugric people were ethnically related, and that even the modern Finno-Ugric-speaking peoples are ethnically related.<ref>{{cite book| author = S\u00e1muel Gyarmathi| title = Grammatical Proof of the Affinity of the Hungarian Language with Languages of Fennic Origin: (Gottingen Dieterich, 1799)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7rmgP02a_mkC| year = 1983| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-272-0976-4 }}</ref> Such hypotheses are based on the assumption that heredity can be traced through linguistic relatedness,<ref>[http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160056 Where do Finnish come from?]</ref> although it must be kept in mind that [[language shift]] and ethnic admixture, a relatively frequent and common occurrence both in recorded history and most likely also in prehistory, confuses the picture and there is no straightforward relationship, if at all, between linguistic and genetic affiliation.

Notable performers in the freestyle genre include [[Stevie B]], [[Corina (singer)|Corina]], [[Lil Suzy]], [[Timmy T]], [[George Lamond]], TKA, [[Noel Pagan|Noel]], [[Company B (band)|Company B]], [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], [[Debbie Deb]], [[Brenda K.

It initially was a fusion of synthetic instrumentation and syncopated [[percussion]] of 1980s [[Electro (music)|electro]], as favored by fans of [[breakdance|breakdancing]]. [[Sampling (music)|Sampling]], as found in [[synth-pop]] music and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], was incorporated. Key influences include [[Afrika Bambaataa]] & [[Soul Sonic Force]]'s \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" (1982) and [[Shannon (American singer)|Shannon]]'s \"[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]\" (1983), the latter was a top-ten [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot 100|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1984-02-25/hot-100|work=Billboard.com|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=31 May 2012|author=Staff|date=25 February 1984}}</ref> By 1987, freestyle began getting more airplay on American pop radio stations. Songs such as \"[[Come Go with Me (Expos\u00e9 song)|Come Go with Me]]\" by [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], \"[[Show Me (The Cover Girls song)|Show Me]]\" by [[The Cover Girls]], \"[[Fascinated]]\" by [[Company B (band)|Company B]], \"[[Silent Morning]]\" by [[Noel Pagan|Noel]] and \"[[Catch Me (I'm Falling)]]\" by [[Pretty Poison (group)|Pretty Poison]], brought freestyle into the mainstream. [[House music]], based partly on [[disco]] rhythms, was by 1992 challenging the relatively upbeat, syncopated freestyle sound.<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite web|title=History of Freestyle Music|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_freestyle.html|work=hyperreal.org|publisher=hyperreal.org|accessdate=31 May 2012|first=Joey|last=Gardner}}</ref>  {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] consider the Miami Mix of [[ABC (band)|ABC]]'s single \"[[When Smokey Sings]]\" to be proto-freestyle.<ref>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11712</ref>\n\n===1987\u20131992: A pop-crossover genre===\nFreestyle's Top 40 Radio airplay started to really take off by 1987, and it began to disappear from the airwaves in the early 1990s<ref name=\"Gardner\"/> as radio stations moved to Top 40-only formats. Artists such as [[George Lamond]], [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], [[Sweet Sensation (trio)|Sweet Sensation]] and [[Stevie B]] were still heard on mainstream radio, but other notable freestyle artists did not fare as well. Carlos Berrios and Platinum producer [[Frankie Cutlass]] appeared to have saved the style's demise by creating a new sound{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that was used on \"[[Temptation (Corina song)|Temptation]]\" by [[Corina (singer)|Corina]] and \"[[Together Forever (Lisette Melendez song)|Together Forever]]\" by [[Lisette Melendez]]. The songs were released in 1991, almost simultaneously, and caused a resurgence in the style when they were embraced by Top 40 radio. \"Temptation\" reached the number 6 spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 Chart. These hits were followed by the success of [[Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam]], who had been one of the earliest freestyle acts. Their records were produced by [[Full Force]], who had also worked with [[UTFO]] and [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]]. Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam had a style that was less electro and more pop, and paved the way for artists such as Corina, Stevie B, George Lamond, Sweet Sensation and the Cover Girls to cross over into the pop market.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Cross-over influences became increasingly evident when the Latin Rascals produced a remix of [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSeveral primarily freestyle artists released [[ballad]]s during the 1980s and early 1990s that crossed over to the pop charts and charted higher than their previous work. These include \"[[Seasons Change (song)|Seasons Change]]\" by Expos\u00e9, \"[[Thinking of You (Sa-Fire song)|Thinking of You]]\" by [[Sa-Fire]], \"[[One More Try (Timmy T. song)|One More Try]]\" by [[Timmy T]], \"[[Because I Love You (The Postman Song)]]\" by Stevie B, and \"[[If Wishes Came True]]\" by Sweet Sensation. Brenda K. Starr reached the Hot 100 with her ballad \"[[I Still Believe (Brenda K. Starr song)|I Still Believe]]\". Freestyle shortly thereafter gave way to mainstream pop artists such as [[MC Hammer]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Bobby Brown]], [[New Kids on the Block]], and [[Milli Vanilli]] (with some artists utilizing elements of freestyle beginning in the 1980s) using hip hop beats and electro samples in a mainstream form with slicker production and [[MTV]]-friendly videos. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] experimented with freestyle and had great success with her single Vogue.  These artists were successful on crossover stations as well as R&B stations, and freestyle was replaced as an underground genre by newer styles such as [[new jack swing]], [[Trance music|trance]] and [[Eurodance]].\n\n===Post-freestyle era===\n\nFreestyle remained a largely [[underground music|underground]] genre with a sizable following in New York, but has recently seen a comeback in the cities where the music originally experienced its greatest success.  New York City impresario Steve Sylvester and producer Sal Abbetiello of Fever Records launched Stevie Sly's Freestyle Party show at the Manhattan live music venue, Coda on April 1, 2004. The show featured Judy Torres, Cynthia, and the Cover Girls and was attended by several celebrity guests. The Coda show was successful, and was followed by a summer 2006 [[Madison Square Garden]] concert that showcased freestyle's most successful performers. New freestyle releases are popular with enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Miami rapper [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]] collaborated with Miami freestyle artist Stevie B to create an updated version of Stevie B's hit, \"Spring Love\".\n\n[[Jordin Sparks]]' 2009 single \"[[S.O.S. (Let the Music Play)]]\" nods heavily to the freestyle genre with its use of a sample from the song \"Let the Music Play\" by Shannon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Let The Music Play by Shannon|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16308|work=Songfacts|publisher=Tone Media|accessdate=31 May 2012|author=Staff}}</ref>{{dubious|date=September 2012}}\n\nIn the modern day, freestyle music continues a thriving fanbase all across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|title = On the Cusp of a Comeback: A Return for Freestyle Music|url = http://www.crossfadr.com/2014/03/31/cusp-comeback-return-freestyle-music/|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}</ref> In cities like New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, recent concerts by freestyle artists have been extremely successful, with many events selling out.\n\n==Influence on other genres== \n===NYC hard house===\n{{distinguish|text=Chicago hard house, nor [[UK hard house]]}}\nAs Latin freestyle in the late 1980s and early 1990s gradually became superseded with house music, dance-pop, and regular hip hop on one front and [[Latin pop|Spanish-language pop music]] with marginal Latin freestyle influences on another, \"harder strain\" of house music originating in New York City was known to incorporate elements of Latin freestyle and the old school hip hop sound. Principal architects of the genre were [[Todd Terry]] (early instances include \"Alright Alright,\" and \"Dum Dum Cry\")<ref name=NRG/><ref name=Deutsch/> and Nitro Deluxe.<ref name=NRG/> Deluxe's \"This Brutal House,\" fusing Latin percussion and the New York electro sound of [[Man Parrish]] with brash house music, proved to have an impact on the United Kingdom's club music scene, presaging the early 1990s British [[Rave music|rave]] scene.<ref name=NRG/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\nFreestyle features a dance tempo with stress on beats two and four; syncopation with a [[bass line]], and a louder bass drum, lead synth, or [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], and optional [[stab (music)|stab]]s of synthesized brass or orchestral [[sampling (music)|sample]]s; [[Sixteenth note|sixteenth-note]] [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]; a [[chord progression]] that lasts eight, 16, or 32 beats and is usually in a minor key; relatively complex, upbeat melodies with singing, verses, and a chorus; and themes about a [[city]], [[broken heart]], [[love]], or [[dancing]]. Freestyle music in general is heavily influenced by electronic instrumentation upon an upbeat dance tempo. Often the Latin [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm is present in many songs, such as Amoretto \"Clave Rocks\" by Rae Serrano aka Amoretto. The tempo is almost always between 110 and 130 [[beats per minute]] (BPM), and is typically 118 BPM. Keyboard parts are influenced by House music, and often contain many short melodies and [[countermelodies]].\n\n===Terminology===\nThe genre was recognized as a subgenre of hip-hop in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"gill\"/> It was dominated by \"hard\" electro beats of the type used primarily at the time in hip-hop music.  Freestyle was more appreciated in larger cities.<ref name=\"gill\"/><ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-04-11/music/let-the-music-play-again/ | title=Let the Music Play (Again) | publisher=[[The Village Voice]] | accessdate=June 15, 2012 | author=Ver\u00e1n, Cristina | date=Apr 11, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the name \"freestyle\" is disputed. One theory is that the term refers to the mixing techniques of [[DJ]]s who spun this form of music in its pre-house incarnations. Freestyle's syncopated beat structures required that DJs incorporate aspects of both electronic and [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] techniques, as they had to mix, or had more freedom to mix, more quickly and responsively to the individual songs. A second explanation is that the music allows for a greater degree of freedom of dance expression than other music of the time, and each dancer is free to create his or her own style. Yet another story holds that the freestyle name evolved in Miami over confusion between two tracks produced by Tony \"Pretty Boy\" Butler: \"Freestyle Express\" by Freestyle and [[Debbie Deb]]'s \"When I Hear Music.\" The sound became synonymous with Butler's production, and the name of the group he was in, Freestyle, became the genre's name. The group was named for the members' love for BMX Freestyle Bike racing.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Freestyle scenes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n\n===New York===\n\"[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]\", by Shannon, is often named as the genre's first hit, and its sound, called \"The Shannon Sound\", as the foundation of the genre. Others like DJ Lex and Triple Beam Records contend that [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" was the first freestyle song produced. \"Let the Music Play\" eventually became freestyle's biggest hit, and still receives frequent airplay. Its producers [[Chris Barbosa]] and Mark Liggett changed and redefined the electro funk sound with the addition of Latin-American rhythms and a syncopated drum-machine sound.\n\nMany early or popular freestyle artists and DJs, such as [[John Benitez|Jellybean]], Tony Torres, Raul Soto, Roman Ricardo, [[Lil Suzy]], and [[Nocera (singer)|Nocera]], were of [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] or [[Italians|Italian]] ancestry, which was one reason for the style's popularity among [[Puerto Rican American]]s and [[Italian Americans]] in the [[New York City]] area and [[Philadelphia]].\n\nThe new sound rejuvenated the funk, soul and hip hop club scenes in New York City. While many neighborhood clubs closed their doors permanently, [[Manhattan]] clubs that played freestyle music began to thrive. Records like \"Play At Your Own Risk\" by [[Planet Patrol]], \"One More Shot\" by C Bank, \"Al-Naafiyish (The Soul)\" by [[Jerry Calliste, Jr.|Hashim]], and \"[[I.O.U. (Freeez song)|I.O.U.]]\" by [[Freeez]] became hits. Established European artists such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]] helped to inspire the original freestyle sound, then incorporated freestyle elements into their own productions.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}\n\nProducers from around the world began to replicate the sound in productions that were more radio-friendly. Records such as \"Let Me Be the One\" by Sa-Fire, \"I Remember What You Like\" by [[Jenny Burton]], \"Running\" by [[Information Society (band)|Information Society]], \"Give Me Tonight\" by Shannon and \"It Works For Me\" by Pam Russo enjoyed heavy [[New York City|New York]] radio airplay.\n\n\nThe production team of [[Tony Moran]] and Albert Cabrera, known as the Latin Rascals, created original music for radio station [[WKTU]] that included freestyle classics like 1984's \"Arabian Nights\", and later hip-hop oriented projects such as the Cover Girls' \"[[Show Me (The Cover Girls song)|Show Me]]\". Tony Moran later formed his own project, Concept of One, and the duo continued to produce freestyle artists into the early 1990s.\n\nFreestyle continues to have a strong following in New York.  Freestyle has begun to regain airtime in clubs across the nation . Interest in freestyle increased as reggaeton's popularity waned. Coro performed in WKTU's well-received \"Beatstock\" concert in 2006, and the 2008 \"Freestyle Extravaganza\" concert sold out Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn March 2013, [[Radio City Music Hall]] hosted the very first freestyle concert. Top freestyle artists included in the line-up were TKA, Safire, Judy Torres, Cynthia, Cover Girls, Lisa Lisa, Shannon, Noel, and Lisette Melendez. Originally scheduled as a one-night event, a second night was added shortly after the first night was sold out in a matter of days.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Miami===\nRadio stations nationwide began to play hits by artists like [[TKA]], [[Sweet Sensation (trio)|Sweet Sensation]], Connie, Expos\u00e9, and Sa-Fire on the same playlists as [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. \"(You Are My) All and All\" by [[Joyce Sims]] became the first freestyle record to cross over into the [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] market, and was one of the first to reach the European market. Radio station [[WPOW]]/Power 96 was noted for exposing freestyle to South Florida in the mid-'80s through the early '90s, as well as mixing in some local [[Miami bass]] into its playlist.\n'Pretty Tony' Butler produced several hits on Miami's Jam-Packed Records, including [[Debbie Deb]]'s \"When I Hear Music\" and \"Lookout Weekend\", and Trinere's \"I'll Be All You'll Ever Need\" and \"They're Playing Our Song\". Company B, Stevie B, [[Paris By Air (band)|Paris By Air]], [[Linear (pop group)|Linear]], [[Will to Power (band)|Will to Power]] and Expos\u00e9's later hits defined Miami freestyle. [[Tolga Katas]] is credited as one of the first persons to create a hit record entirely on a computer,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and produced Stevie B's \"Party Your Body\", \"In My Eyes\" and \"Dreamin' of Love\". Katas' record label Futura Records was an incubator for artists such as Linear, who achieved international success after a move from Futura to Atlantic Records. Many labels expected New York freestyle and Miami freestyle to have the same audience and thought that the same promotional strategy would work for both genres, which often led to poor results for the New York\u2013based freestyle. New York freestyle retained a raw edge and underground sound even in its most polished forms. It used minor chords that made the tracks darker and more moody, and its lyrics tended to be about unrequited love or more somber themes that dealt with the reality of what inner city teens were experiencing emotionally.\n\n===Philadelphia===\nThe groundbreaking \"Nightime\" by [[Pretty Poison (group)|Pretty Poison]] featuring red headed diva [[Jade Starling]] in 1984 initially put Philadelphia on the freestyle map. Their follow-up \"Catch Me I'm Falling\" was a worldwide hit and brought freestyle to [[American Bandstand]], [[Soul Train]], [[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]] and the [[The Arsenio Hall Show|Arsenio Hall Show]]. \"Catch Me I'm Falling\" broke on the street during the summer of 1987 and was the #1 single at WCAU (98 Hot Hits) and #2 at WUSL (Power 99) during the first two weeks of July. [[Virgin Records]] was quick to sign [[Pretty Poison (group)|Pretty Poison]] helping to usher in the avalanche of other major label signings from the exploding freestyle scene.\nSeveral freestyle acts followed on the heels of [[Pretty Poison (group)|Pretty Poison]] emerging from the metropolitan Philadelphia, PA area in the early 1990s. Artists such as Dulaio Twins, D.T.U. (Doin' The Ultimate), Full Afekt, Denine, Marr\u00e9 and [[T.P.E.]] (The Philadelphia Experiment) enjoyed regional success. Anthony Ponzio and Anthony Santosusso of D.T.U. teamed up with DJ Mike Ferullo in 1993 to form Tazmania Records, and T.P.E.'s Adam Marano formed Viper-7 Records. The two labels produced radio hits by such artists as [[Collage (singer)|Collage]] and Denine that would lead the resurgence of the freestyle genre in the mid-1990s. Tazmania closed in the late 1990s, while Viper-7 is now known as the Viper Music Network and covers a broad spectrum of music genres.\n\nFreestyle experienced another resurgence of popularity in the late 2000s, as older, well-known freestyle artists, producers and record labels released new music, and old and new freestyle artists performed at Philadelphia-area bars and night clubs. [[Tazmania Records]] reopened in 2009 and began to release new music. The ''[[Tazmania Freestyle]]'' compilation album ''Overloaded'' featured some of the biggest acts from their past, such as Pure Pleazure, Stefanie Bennett, Sammy C and Samantha,<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Tazmania Freestyle - Overloaded: Various Artists: MP3 Downloads|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tazmania-Freestyle-Overloaded/dp/B003QNGCW8|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2012}} but the label has since shifted focus toward pop and house. Previously announced Viper Music Network projects have failed to materialize.\n\n===California===\nFreestyle had a recognizable following in [[California]], particularly in [[Los Angeles]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[San Diego]]. California's large Latino community enjoyed the sounds of the East Coast Latin club scene, and a number of California artists became popular among freestyle fans on the East Coast. Northern California freestyle, mainly from [[San Francisco]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], leans towards a high-tempo dance beat similar to [[Hi-NRG]]. Most freestyle in California emerged from the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] and [[Los Angeles]] regions.\n\nCalifornia's large [[Filipino American]] community also embraced freestyle music during the late 1980s and early 1990s. [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]] was one of the first Filipina-American freestyle singers, and reached number 44 in 1990 with \"If You Leave Me Now\". Subsequent Filipino-American freestyle artists include [[Jocelyn Enriquez]], Buffy, Korell, Damien Bautista, [[One Voice (band)|One Voice]], Kuya, [[Sharyn Maceren]], and others.\n\n[[Timmy T]], Bernadette, Caleb-B, SF Spanish Fly, Daize, Angelina, One Voice, M:G, Stephanie Fastro & The S Factor are from the Bay Area, and San Diego artists Gustavo {{Not a typo|Campain}}, Alex {{Not a typo|Campain}}, Jose (Jojo) Santos, Robert Romo of the group Internal Affairs, F. Felix, Leticia, and [[Frankie J]] were popular freestyle artists from southern California.\n\n===Canada===\nFreestyle's popularity spread outward from the [[Greater Toronto Area]]'s Italian, Hispanic/Latino and Greek populations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was showcased alongside [[house music]] in various [[Toronto]] nightclubs, but by the mid-1990s was replaced almost entirely by house music.\n\n[[Lil' Suzy]] released several 12-inch singles and performed live on the Canadian live dance music television program ''[[Electric Circus]]''. Montreal singer [[Nancy Martinez]]'s 1986 single \"For Tonight\" would become the first Canadian freestyle single to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the Montreal girl group [[11:30]] reached the Canadian chart with \"Ole Ole\" in 2000.\n\n===Elsewhere in the world===\nPerformers and producers associated with the style also came from around the world, including Turkish-American Murat Konar (the writer of Information Society's \"Running\"), [[Paul Lekakis]] from [[Greece]], Asian artist Leonard (Leon Youngboy) who released the song \"Youngboys\", and [[United Kingdom|British]] musicians including [[Freeez]], [[Paul Hardcastle]], [[Samantha Fox]], and even [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]], who also adopted the freestyle sound in his 1984 album ''[[Secret Agent (Robin Gibb album)|Secret Agent]]'', having worked with producer [[Chris Barbosa]]. Several British [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[synthpop]] bands also teamed up with freestyle producers or were influenced by the genre, and released freestyle songs or remixes. These include [[Duran Duran]] whose song \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" was remixed by the Latin Rascals, and whose album ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' contained several freestyle inspired songs such as \"[[All She Wants Is]]\"; [[New Order (band)|New Order]] who teamed up with [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], producing and co-writing the track \"[[Confusion (New Order song)|Confusion]]\"; [[Erasure]] and the Der Deutsche mixes of their song \"[[Blue Savannah]]\"; and the [[Pet Shop Boys]], whose song \"[[Domino Dancing]]\" was produced by [[Miami]]-based freestyle producer [[Lewis Martine\u00e9]].\n\n==Record labels==\n;Prehistory\n* [[Salsoul Records]]<ref name=Oye/>\n;Golden age Latin freestyle era\n* Cutting Records<ref name=Deutsch/> {{small|([https://www.discogs.com/label/2517-Cutting-Records Discogs])}}\n* [[Sleeping Bag Records]]<ref name=Deutsch/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{hiphop}}\n{{Boogierock}}\n{{amerisalsa}}\n\n[[Category:Electronic dance music genres]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American culture]]\n[[Category:Italian-American culture]]\n[[Category:1980s in music]]\n[[Category:1990s in music]]\n[[Category:Hispanic American music]]", "sha1": "3tjzke8wmqniub2f6z062ns4q2dd0id"}}, {"title": "Fantasy (psychology)", "ns": "0", "id": "10810", "revision": {"id": "866294781", "parentid": "861987656", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T14:04:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "ForlornFreddy", "id": "34868697"}, "comment": "/* In schizophrenia */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the literary genre|Fantasy}}\n[[File:R\u00e4tsel der Psyche, Margret Hofheinz-D\u00f6ring, \u00d6l, 1970 (WV-Nr.5010).jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Psychic mystery'' by [[Margret Hofheinz-D\u00f6ring]] (1910\u20131994)]]\n'''Fantasy''' in a psychological sense refers to two different possible aspects of [[the mind]], the conscious, and the unconscious.  In the unconscious sense, it is sometimes spelled \"phantasy\".\n\n==Conscious fantasy==\n\nA fantasy is a situation [[imagination|imagined]] by an individual that expresses certain desires or aims on the part of its creator. Fantasies sometimes involve situations that are highly unlikely; or they may be quite realistic. Fantasies can also be [[sexual fantasy|sexual]] in nature. Another, more basic meaning of fantasy is something which is not 'real,' as in perceived explicitly by any of the senses, but exists as an imagined situation of object to subject.\n\nIn everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done...fantasies of control or of sovereign choice...daydreams'.<ref>Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 183</ref>\n\n[[George Eman Vaillant]] in his study of [[defence mechanisms]] took as a central example of 'an immature defence...''fantasy''  \u2014  living in a \"[[Walter Mitty]]\" dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job'.<ref>Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) pp. 53\u20134</ref>  Fantasy, when pushed to the extreme, is a common trait of [[narcissistic personality disorder]]; and certainly 'Vaillant found that not one person who used fantasy a lot had any close friends'.<ref>Skynner/Cleese, p. 54</ref>\n\nOther researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements&nbsp;\u2014 providing 'small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect'.<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 554</ref> Research by [[Deirdre Barrett]] reports that people differ radically in the vividness, as well as frequency of fantasy, and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art, literature, or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions.<ref>Barrett, Deirdre Fantasizers and Dissociaters: An Empirically based schema of two types of deep trance subjects.

He considered that men and women \"cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality.  'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions,' as [[Theodor Fontane]] once said ... [without] dwelling on imaginary [[wish fulfillment]]s.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 419</ref>  As childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed, so too 'one species of thought activity was split off; it was kept free from reality-testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone.  This activity is ''fantasying''...continued as ''day-dreaming''.<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 39</ref>  He compared such phantasising to the way a 'nature reserve preserves its original state where everything...including what is useless and even what is noxious, can grow and proliferate there as it pleases'.<ref>Freud, ''Introductory'' p. 419</ref>\n\n[[Daydreaming|Daydreams]] for Freud were thus a valuable resource.  \"These day-dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest; they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity ... such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopatholgy'' (Penguin Freud Library 100 p. 88</ref>  He considered \"These phantasies include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of the subject's personality\" and that the energetic man \"is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality,\" whereas the artist \"can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms ... the doom of neurosis.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1995) p. 81</ref>\n\n==In schizophrenia==\nIn the context of occurrences of the mental disorder known as [[schizophrenia]], individuals who exhibit symptoms fulfilling this particular classification might be experiencing fantasies as part of the diagnosis (Shneidman, E.

In her thought, this kind of 'play activity inside the person is known as \"unconscious fantasy\".  And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive.  They are different from ordinary day-dreams or \"fantasies\" (spelled with an \"f\")'.<ref>Robert Hinshelwood and Susan Robinson, ''Introducing Melanie Klein'', (Cambridge 2006) p. 100</ref>\n\nThe term \"fantasy\" became a central issue with the development of the Kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and was at the heart of the so-called [[Controversial discussions]] of the wartime years.  'A paper by Susan Isaacs (1952) on \"The nature and function of Phantasy\"...has been generally accepted by the Klein group in London as a fundamental statement of their position'.<ref>R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Middlesex 1969) p. 17 and note</ref>  As a defining feature, 'Kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects.  These are thought of as primary and innate, and as the mental representations of instincts...the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms'.<ref>Hinshelwood/Robinson, ''Introducing'' p. 174</ref>\n\nIsaacs considered that 'Unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life, both in normal and neurotic people, the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies';<ref>Quoted in Laing, p. 19</ref>  Most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that 'Both in analysis and life, we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious fantasy'.<ref>Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: the Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 76</ref>  Isaacs however claimed that 'Freud's \"hallucinatory wish-fulfilment\" and his..\"introjection\" and \"projection\" are the basis of the fantasy life';<ref>Quoted in Laing, p. 18</ref> and how far unconscious fantasy was a genuine development of Freud's ideas, how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic [[paradigm]], is perhaps the key question of the Controversial discussions.\n\n==Lacan, fantasy, and desire==\n\n[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] engaged from early on with 'the phantasies revealed by Melanie Klein...the ''imago'' of the mother...this shadow of the ''bad internal objects'''<ref>Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 284 and p. 21</ref> \u2014 with the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary]].  Increasingly, however, it was Freud's idea of fantasy as a kind of 'screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected'<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (Penguin Freud Library 9) p. 328</ref> that was for him of greater importance.  Lacan came to believe that 'the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition'.<ref>Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 60</ref>\n\nPhantasies thus both link to and block off the individual's unconscious, his kernel or real core: ' ''subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split, in the resistance of the phantasy'' ',<ref>F. Wahl, in Lacan, ''Four'' p. 89</ref> which thus comes close to the centre of the individual's personality and its splits and conflicts. 'The subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy...whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well-developed forms of day-dreaming';<ref>Lacan ''Four'' p. 185</ref> and as a rule 'a subject's fantasies are close variations on a single theme...the \"fundamental fantasy\"...minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire'.<ref>Phillip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners (London 1997) p. 75</ref>\n\nThe goal of therapy thus became ' ''la traversee du fantasme'', the crossing over, traversal, or traversing of the fundamental fantasy'.<ref>Bruce Fink, ''The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance'' (Princeton 1997) p. 61</ref>  For Lacan, 'The traversing of fantasy involves the subject's assumption of a new position with respect to the Other as language and the Other as desire...a utopian moment beyond neurosis'.<ref>Fink p. 62 and p. 72</ref>  The question he was left with was 'What, then, does he who has passed through the experience...who has traversed the radical phantasy...become?'.<ref>Lacan, ''Four'' p. 273</ref>\n\n==The ''fantasy principle''==\n\nThe postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication.   Here, we are told, 'We need to go beyond the pleasure principle, the reality principle, and repetition compulsion to...the ''fantasy principle'' ' - 'not, as Freud did, reduce fantasies to wishes...[but consider] all other imaginable emotions';<ref>Michael Vannoy Adams 1996 (''The Multicultural Imagination: Race, Color, and the Unconscious''), quoted in Dawn Freshwater and Chris Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 43</ref> and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating.\n\nSuch a perspective 'sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective \"typifications\"'.<ref>Freshwater/robertson, p. 43</ref>\n\n==Narcissistic personality disorder==\nTwo characteristics of someone with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] are:<ref name=\"DSM-IV-TR\">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108003738/http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm |date=2010-01-08 }}</ref>\n* A pervasive pattern of [[grandiosity]] (in fantasy or behavior)\n* A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*''[[Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming]]''\n*[[Escapism]]\n*[[Family romance]]\n*[[Fantasy prone personality]]\n*[[Object relations theory|Unconscious fantasy]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Michael Vannoy Adams, ''The fantasy principle: psychoanalysis of the imagination'' (East Sussex 2004)\n*Julia Segal, ''Phantasies in Everyday Life'' (1995)\n*Riccardo Steiner ed., ''Unconscious fantasy'' (Karnac 2003)\n*G.

However, it is possible to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if ''Ana Laura Melachenko'' and ''Emanuel Dar\u00edo Guerrero'' had a daughter named ''Adabel Anah\u00ed'', her full name could be ''[[Adabel Guerrero|Adabel Anah\u00ed Guerrero Melachenko]]''. Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their [[Maiden and married names|birth family names]] instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining \"''de''\" and her husband's surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become ''Paula Segovia de Cossia'' or ''Paula Cossia''.\n\nThere are some province offices where a married woman can use only her birth name, and some others where she has to use the complete name, for legal purposes. The Argentine Civilian Code states both uses are correct, but police offices and passports are issued with the complete name. Today most women prefer to maintain their birth name given that \"de\" can be interpreted as meaning they belong to their husbands.\n\nWhen Eva Duarte married [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]], she could be addressed as Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n, but the preferred style was [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], or the familiar and affectionate ''Evita'' (little Eva).\n\nCombined names come from old traditional families and are considered one last name, but are rare. Although Argentina is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country, it is also composed of other [[demographics of Argentina|varied European influences]], such as Italian, French, Russian, German, etc.\n\nChildren typically use their fathers' last names only. Some state offices have started to use both last names, in the traditional father then mother order, to reduce the risk of a person being mistaken for others using the same name combinations, e.g. if Eva Duarte and Juan Per\u00f3n had a child named Juan, he might be misidentified if he were called ''Juan Per\u00f3n'', but not if he was known as Juan Per\u00f3n Duarte.\n\nIn early 2008, some new legislation is under consideration that will place the mother's last name ahead the father's last name, as it is done in [[Married and maiden names#Portuguese-speaking world|Portuguese-speaking]] countries and only optionally in Spain, despite Argentina being a Spanish-speaking country.\n\n===Chile===\nIn [[Chile]], marriage has no effect at all on either of the spouses' names, so people keep their birth names for all their life, no matter how many times marital status, theirs or that of their parents, may change. However, in some upper-class circles or in older couples, even though considered to be old-fashioned, it is still customary for a wife to use her husband's name as reference, as in \"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s de Ram\u00edrez\" (literally Lady Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s (wife) of Ram\u00edrez).\n\nChildren will always bear the surname of the father followed by that of the mother, but if there is no known father and the mother is single, the children can bear either both of her mother's surnames or the mother's first surname followed by any of the surnames of the mother's parents or grandparents, or the child may bear the mother's first surname twice in a row.\n\n{{see also|#The Philippines}}\n\n==Basque country==\n{{details|Basque surnames}}\n\n==French-speaking countries==\n'''France''' {{details|French name}}\n'''Belgium''' {{details|Walloon name}}\n'''Canadian''' {{details|Canadian name}}\n\n==German-speaking countries==\n{{details|German family name etymology}}\n\nThere are about 1,000,000{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} different family names in German. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. Hyphenations notwithstanding, they mostly consist of a single word; in those rare cases where the family name is linked to the given names by particles such as ''von'' or ''zu'', they usually indicate [[nobility|noble]] [[ancestry]]. Not all noble families used these names (see [[Riedesel]]), while some farm families, particularly in [[Westphalia]], used the particle ''von'' or ''zu'' followed by their farm or former farm's name as a family name (see ''Meyer zu Erpen'').\n\nFamily names in German-speaking countries are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: in parts of Austria and Bavaria and the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic-speaking]] areas, the family name is regularly put in front of the first given name. Also in many \u2013 especially [[rural]] \u2013 parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]]: ''R\u00fcters Erich'', for example, would be Erich of the R\u00fcter family.\n\nIn Germany today, upon marriage, both partners can choose to keep their birth name or choose either partner's name as the common name. In the latter case the partner whose name wasn't chosen can keep his birth name hyphenated to the new name (e.g. ''Schmidt'' and ''Meyer'' choose to marry under the name ''Meyer''. The former ''Schmidt'' can choose to be called ''Meyer'', ''Schmidt-Meyer'' or ''Meyer-Schmidt''), but any children will only get the single common name. In the case that both partners keep their birth name they must decide on one of the two family names for all their future children. ([[German name]])\n\nChanging one's family name for reasons other than marriage, divorce or adoption is possible only if the application is approved by the responsible government agency. Permission will usually be granted if:\n* the old name is very common and leads to confusion;\n* the old name is overly long or very difficult to spell or pronounce (especially with names of former nobility and of citizens with non-German ancestry); or\n* the old name has negative connotations or is easily ridiculed.\n\nOtherwise, name changes will normally not be granted.\n\n==Portuguese-speaking countries==\n{{main article|Surname#Portuguese-speaking countries}}\n{{further|Portuguese name}}\n\n==Dutch-speaking countries==\n{{Main article|Dutch name}}\nThe '''Netherlands''' and '''Belgium''' ([[Flanders]])\n\n==Scandinavia==\n{{further|Scandinavian family name etymology}}\nIn Scandinavia, family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is ''-sen'', as in ''Karlsen''. Names ending with ''dotter/datter'' (daughter), such as ''Olofsdotter'', are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's father does not have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familiestyrelsen.dk/navne/ |title=Familiestyrelsen: Navne |publisher=Familiestyrelsen.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlss\u00f8n or Annas\u00f8n and a daughter Karlsdatter or Annasdatter.\n\nBefore the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather (e.g. Earl [[Birger jarl|Birger Magnusson]] ''[[Folkung]]e''{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} <!-- He was never named like that during his lifetime. -->) or to the family's [[coat of arms]] (e.g. King [[Gustav Vasa|Gustav Eriksson]] ''[[House of Vasa|Vasa]]''). In many surviving family noble names, such as ''Silfversparre'' (\"silver chevron\"; in modern spelling, ''Silver-'') or ''Stiernhielm'' (\"star-helmet\"; in modernized spelling, ''stj\u00e4rnhj\u00e4lm''), the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged. (Some names from relatively modern times also use archaic or otherwise aberrant spelling as a stylistic trait; e.g. ''-quist'' instead of standard ''-kvist'' \"twig\" or ''-gr\u00e9n'' instead of standard ''-gren'', \"branch\".)\n\nLater on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish ''Bergman'' (\"mountain man\"), ''Holmberg'' (\"island mountain\"), ''Lindgren'' (\"linden branch\"), ''Sandstr\u00f6m'' (\"sand stream\") and ''\u00c5kerlund'' (\"field meadow\") were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.\nAnother common practice was to adopt one's place of origin as a middle or surname.\n\nEven more important a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, to develop a system under which each individual had a \"stable\" name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This is part of the origin, in this part of the world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a change of address, and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father's name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. [[Einar Gerhardsen]], the Norwegian [[prime minister]], used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many [[working class|working-class]] families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.\n\nThese names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of last names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffixes like ''-b\u00f8'', ''-rud'', ''-heim/-um'', ''-land'' or ''-set'' (these being examples from Norway). In Denmark, the most common suffix is ''-gaard'' \u2014 the modern spelling is ''g\u00e5rd'' in Danish and can be either ''g\u00e5rd'' or ''gard'' in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably ''[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'' (combined by the words \"kirke/kierke\" (= church) and \"gaard\" (= farm) meaning \"the farm located by the Church\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mydanishroots.com/surnames/deriving_from_a_farmstead.html |author=MyDanishRoots.com |title=Surnames deriving from a farmstead }}</ref> It is, however, a common misunderstanding that the name relates to its direct translation: churchyard/cemetery), but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners' domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.<ref>[http://www.nndata.no/home/jborgos/names.htm ''Norwegian Naming Patterns'' (Johan I. Borgos)]</ref>\n\nIn many cases, names were taken from the nature around them. In Norway, for instance, there is an abundance of surnames based on coastal geography, with suffixes like ''-strand'', ''-\u00f8y'', ''-holm'', ''-vik'', ''-fjord'' or ''-nes''. Like the names derived from farms, most of these family names reflected the family's place of residence at the time the family name was \"fixed\", however. A family name such as Swedish ''Dahlgren'' is derived from \"dahl\" meaning valley and \"gren\" meaning branch; or similarly ''[[Upvall family|Upvall]]'' meaning \"upper-valley\"; It depends on the Scandinavian country, language, and dialect.<ref>[http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/genealogy/naming.htm ''Norwegian Names'' (Norwegian-American Historical Association)]</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main article|Swedish name}}\n\nIn [[Scandinavia]] family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames in a similar fashion to that of the [[gentry]]. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish ''Bergman'' (\"mountain man\"), ''Holmberg'' (\"island mountain\"), ''Lindgren'' (\"linden branch\"), ''Sandstr\u00f6m'' (\"sand stream\") and ''\u00c5kerlund'' (\"field grove\") were quite frequent and remain common today.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main article|Finnish name}}\n\nFinland including [[Karelia]] and [[Estonia]] was the eastern part of The Kingdom of Sweden from its unification around 1100 - 1200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly [[Finnish People|Finnish]] (increasing) and [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] (decreasing) surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the ''Finnish'' in Finland: the [[West Finnish]] and the [[East Finnish]]. The surname traditions of ''Swedish-speaking'' farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of ''[[Sami people|Sami]]'' and ''[[Finnish Romani|Romani people]]'' have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.\n\nUntil the mid 20th Century, Finland was a predominantly [[agriculture|agrarian]] society, and the names of West [[Finnish people|Finns]] were based on their association with a particular area, [[farm]], or [[Smallholding|homestead]], e.g. ''Jaakko Jussila'' (\"Jaakko from the farm of Jussi\"). On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the [[Savonian people|Savonians]] pursued [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families, e.g. ''Ik\u00e4valko'', ''Termonen'', ''Pentik\u00e4inen''. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the name of the former or current place of living (e.g. ''Puumalainen'' < [[Puumala]]). In the East Finnish tradition, the women carried the family name of their fathers in female form (e.g. ''Puumalatar'' < ''Puumalainen''). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of the West-European surname tradition.\n\nIn Western Finland, agrarian names dominated, and the last name of the person was usually given according to the farm or holding they lived on. In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, the agrarian names were usually adopted as surnames. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes ''Ala-'' (Sub-) or ''Yl\u00e4-'' (Up-), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding. (e.g. ''Yli-Ojanper\u00e4'', ''Ala-Verronen''). The Swedish speaking farmers along the coast of \u00d6sterbotten usually used two surnames \u2013 one which pointed out the father's name (e.g. ''Eriksson'', ''Andersson'', ''Johansson'') and one which related to the farm or the land their family or bigger family owned or had some connection to (e.g. ''Holm'', ''Fant'', ''Westerg\u00e5rd'', ''Kloo''). So a full name could be ''Johan Karlsson Kvist'', for his daughter ''Elvira Johansdotter Kvist'', and when she married a man with the Ahlskog farm, Elvira kept the first surname Johansdotter but changed the second surname to her husbands (e.g. ''Elvira Johansdotter Ahlskog''). During the 20th century they started to drop the -son surname while they kept the second. So in Western Finland the Swedish speaking had names like ''Johan Varg'', ''Karl Viskas'', ''Sebastian Byskata'' and ''Elin Loo'', while the Swedes in Sweden at the other side of the Baltic Sea kept surnames ending with ''-son'' ((e.g. ''Johan Eriksson'', ''Thor Andersson'', ''Anna-Karin Johansson'').\n\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced in south Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes, which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in the case of clergy) Latin surname. In the case of [[Swedish allotment system|enlisted soldiers]], the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process, and especially the political movement of [[fennicization]], caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings ''-o/\u00f6'', ''-nen'' (''Meri\u00f6'' < ''Meri'' \"sea\", ''Nieminen'' < ''Niemi'' \"point\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (''Paasivirta'' < ''H\u00e4llstr\u00f6m'').<ref>The whole section is based on the article Paikkala, S.

Retrieved 11-6-2007. {{fi icon}}</ref>\n\nIn 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the German model. Every person is legally obligated to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. The Finnish married couple may adopt the name of either spouse, or either spouse (or both spouses) may decide to use a double name. The parents may choose either surname or the double surname for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname.<ref>[http://www.mol.fi/mol/fi/99_pdf/fi/04_maahanmuutto/07_aineistot_kirjasto/01_esitteet/tasarv/tasarv_eng.pdf Equality in Finland: Information for immigrants]</ref> All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or is in use by any person residing in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors if they can prove such claim.<ref>The information here is taken from the Finnish [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 ''Nimilaki (694/1985)] (Name Act). Retrieved 11-6-2007.</ref> Some immigrants have had difficulty naming their children, as they must choose from an approved list based on the family's household language.\n\nIn the Finnish language, both the root of the surname and the first name can be modified by [[consonant gradation]] regularly when inflected to a case.\n\n===Iceland===\n{{details|topic=Naming conventions of Iceland|Icelandic name}}\n\nIn [[Iceland]], most people have no family name; a person's last name is most commonly a patronymic, i.e. derived from the father's first name. For example, when a man called ''Karl'' has a daughter called ''Anna'' and a son called ''Magn\u00fas'', their full names will typically be ''Anna Karlsd\u00f3ttir'' (\"Karl's daughter\") and ''Magn\u00fas Karlsson'' (\"Karl's son\"). The name is not changed upon marriage.\n\n==Slavic world==\n{{main article|Slavic names|Slavic name suffixes|Eastern Slavic naming customs}}\n\nSlavic countries are noted for having masculine and feminine versions for many (but not all) of their names. In most countries the use of a feminine form is obligatory in official documents as well as in other communication, except for foreigners. In some countries only the male form figures in official use (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia), but in communication (speech, print) a feminine form is often used.\n\nIn '''Slovenia''' the last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used.\n\nIf the name has no suffix, it may or may not have a feminine version. Sometimes it has the ending changed (such as the addition of ''-a''). In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, suffixless names, such as those of German origin, are feminized by adding ''-ov\u00e1'' (for example, ''Schusterov\u00e1'').\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main article|Bulgarian name}}\n[[Bulgaria]]n names usually consist of three components \u2013 given name, patronymic (based on father's name), family name.\n\nGiven names have many variations, but the most common names have Christian/Greek (e.g. [[wikt:Maria|Maria]], [[wikt:Ivan|Ivan]], [[wikt:Christo|Christo]], Peter, [[wikt:Pavel|Pavel]]), [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] (Ognyan, [[wikt:Miroslav|Miroslav]], [[wikt:Tihomir|Tihomir]]) or [[Bulgars|Protobulgarian]] (Krum, [[wikt:Asparukh|Asparukh]]) (pre-Christian) origin.\nFather's names normally consist of the father's first name and the \"-ov\" (male) or \"-ova\" (female) or \"-ovi\" (plural) suffix.\n\nFamily names usually also end with the \"-ov\", \"-ev\" (male) or \"-ova\", \"-eva\" (female) or \"-ovi\", \"-evi\" (plural) suffix.\n\nIn many cases (depending on the name root) the suffixes can be also \"-ski\" (male and plural) or \"-ska\" (female); \"-ovski\", \"-evski\" (male and plural) or \"-ovska\", \"-evska\" (female); \"-in\" (male) or \"-ina\" (female) or \"-ini\" (plural); etc.\n\nThe meaning of the suffixes is similar to the English word \"of\", expressing membership in/belonging to a family.\nFor example, the family name Ivanova means a person belonging to the Ivanovi family.\n\nA father's name Petr*ov* means son of Peter.\n\nRegarding the different meaning of the suffixes, \"-ov\", \"-ev\"/\"-ova\", \"-eva\" are used for expressing relationship to the father and \"-in\"/\"-ina\" for relationship to the mother (often for orphans whose father is dead).\n\n===Czech Republic and Slovakia===\n{{Main article|Czech name|Slovak name}}\n\nNames of [[Czechs|Czech people]] consist of given name (''k\u0159estn\u00ed jm\u00e9no'') and surname (''p\u0159\u00edjmen\u00ed''). Usage of the second or middle name is not common. Feminine names are usually derived from masculine ones by a suffix ''-ov\u00e1'' (''Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1'') or ''-\u00e1'' for names being originally adjectives (''Vesel\u00e1''), sometimes with a little change of original name's ending (''Sedl\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1'' from ''Sedl\u00e1\u010dek'' or ''Svobodov\u00e1'' from ''Svoboda''). Women usually change their family names when they get married. The family names are usually [[noun]]s (''Svoboda'', ''Kr\u00e1l'', ''R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka'', ''Dvo\u0159\u00e1k'', ''Bene\u0161''), [[adjective]]s (''Novotn\u00fd'', ''\u010cern\u00fd'', ''Vesel\u00fd'') or past participles of [[verb]]s (''Posp\u00ed\u0161il''). There are also a couple of names with more complicated origin which are actually complete sentences (''Sko\u010ddopole'', ''Hrejsemnou'' or ''V\u00edt\u00e1mv\u00e1s''). The most common Czech family name is ''Nov\u00e1k'' / ''Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1''.\n\nIn addition, many Czechs and some Slovaks have German surnames due to mixing between the ethnic groups over the past thousand years. Deriving women's names from German and other foreign names is often problematic since foreign names do not suit [[Czech language]] rules, although most commonly ''-ov\u00e1'' is simply added (''Schmidtov\u00e1''; umlauts are often, but not always, dropped, e.g. ''M\u00fcllerov\u00e1''), or the German name is respelled with Czech spelling (''\u0160mitov\u00e1''). Hungarian names, which can be found fairly commonly among Slovaks, can also be either left unchanged (Hungarian ''Nagy'', fem. ''Nagyov\u00e1'') or respelled according to Czech/Slovak orthography (masc. ''Na\u010f'', fem. ''Na\u010fov\u00e1'').\n\n===Poland===\n{{Main article|Polish name}}\n\nIn Poland and most of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics. Thus, early surnames indicating occupation include ''Karczmarz'' (\"innkeeper\"), ''Kowal'' (\"blacksmith\"), \"Z\u0142otnik\" (\"gold smith\") and ''Bednarczyk'' (\"young cooper\"), while those indicating patronymic descent include ''Szczepaniak'' (\"Son of ''Szczepan''), ''J\u00f3zefowicz'' (\"Son of ''J\u00f3zef''), and ''Ka\u017amirkiewicz'' (\"Son of ''Kazimierz''\"). Similarly, early surnames like ''Mazur'' (\"the one from [[Masuria|Mazury]]\") indicated geographic origin, while ones like ''Nowak'' (\"the new one\"), ''Bia\u0142y'' (\"the pale one\"), and ''Wielgus'' (\"the big one\") indicated personal characteristics.\n\nIn the early 16th century, ( the [[Polish Renaissance]]), toponymic names became common, especially among the [[szlachta|nobility]]. Initially, the surnames were in a form of \"[first name] ''z'' (\"de\", \"of\") [location]\". Later, most surnames were changed to adjective forms, e.g. ''Jakub Wi\u015blicki'' (\"James of [[Wi\u015blica]]\") and ''[[Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki (disambiguation)|Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki]]'' (\"''Zbigniew'' of [[Olesnica|Ole\u015bnica]]\"), with masculine [[suffix (linguistics)|suffixes]] ''-ski'', ''-cki'', ''-dzki'' and ''-icz'' or respective feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', ''-dzka'' and ''-icz'' on the east of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Names formed this way are adjectives grammatically, and therefore change their form depending on sex; for example, ''Jan Kowalski'' and ''Maria Kowalska'' collectively use the plural ''Kowalscy''.\n\nNames with masculine suffixes ''-ski'', ''-cki'', and ''-dzki'', and corresponding feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', and ''-dzka'' became associated with noble origin. Many people from lower classes successively changed their surnames to fit this pattern. This produced many ''Kowalski''s, ''Bednarski''s, ''Kaczmarski''s and so on.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA separate class of surnames derive from the names of [[szlachta|noble clans]]. These are used either as separate names or the first part of a double-barrelled name. Thus, persons named ''Jan Nieczuja'' and ''Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki'' might be related. Similarly, after World War I and World War II, many members of [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground organizations]] adopted their [[nom de guerre|war-time pseudonyms]] as the first part of their surnames. ''Edward Rydz'' thus became [[Marshal of Poland]] ''[[Edward Smigly-Rydz|Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz]]'' and ''Zdzis\u0142aw Jeziora\u0144ski'' became ''[[Jan Nowak-Jezioranski|Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]]''.\n\n===Russia===\nA full [[Russians|Russian]] name consists of personal (given) name, patronymic, and family name (surname).\n\nMost Russian family names originated from patronymics, that is, father's name usually formed by adding the adjective suffix ''-ov(a)'' or ''-ev(a)''. Contemporary patronymics, however, have a substantive suffix ''-ich'' for masculine and the adjective suffix ''-na'' for feminine.\n\nFor example, the proverbial triad of most common Russian surnames follows:\n* ''Ivan'''ov''''' (son of Ivan),\n* ''Petr'''ov''''' (son of Peter),\n* ''Sidor'''ov''''' (son of Sidor).\n\nFeminine forms of these surnames have the ending ''-a'':\n* ''Ivan'''ova''''' (daughter of Ivan),\n* ''Petr'''ova''''' (daughter of Peter),\n* ''Sidor'''ova''''' (daughter of Sidor).\n\nSuch a pattern of name formation is not unique to Russia or even to the Eastern and Southern Slavs in general; quite common are also names derived from professions, places of origin, and personal characteristics, with various suffixes (e.g. ''-in(a)'' and ''-sky (-skaya)'').\n\nProfessions:\n* ''kuznets'' ([[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]) \u2192 ''Kuznetsov''\u2014''Kuznetsova''\n* ''portnoi'' ([[tailor]]) \u2192 ''Portnov''\u2014''Portnova''\n* ''pastukh'' ([[shepherd]]) \u2192 ''Pastukhov''\u2014''Pastukhova''.\n\nPlaces of origin:\n* ''Moskva'' (Moscow) \u2192 ''Moskvin''\u2014''Moskvina'', ''Moskovsky''\u2014''Moskovskaya'',\n* ''Smolensk'' \u2192 ''Smolensky''\u2014''Smolenskaya'',\n* ''Riazan'' \u2192 ''Riazanov''\u2014''Riazanova'', ''Riazantsev''\u2014''Riazantseva''.\n\nPersonal characteristics:\n* ''tolsty'' (stout, fat) \u2192 ''Tolstov''\u2014''Tolstova'', ''Tolstoy''\u2014''Tolstaya'',\n* ''nos'' (nose) \u2192 ''Nosov''\u2014''Nosova'',\n* ''sedoi'' (grey-haired or -headed) \u2192 ''Sedov''\u2014''Sedova''.\n\nA considerable number of \"artificial\" names exists, for example, those given to seminary graduates; such names were based on [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church]] or Christian virtues.\n\nGreat Orthodox Feasts:\n* ''rozhdestvo'' (Christmas) \u2192 ''Rozhdestvensky''\u2014''Rozhdestvenskaya'',\n* ''voskresenie'' (Resurrection) \u2192 ''Voskresensky''\u2014''Voskresenskaya'',\n* ''uspenie'' (Assumption) \u2192 ''Uspensky''\u2014''Uspenskaya''.\n\nChristian virtues:\n* ''philagathos'' (one who loves goodness) \u2192 ''Dobrolubov''\u2014''Dobrolubova'', ''Dobrolubsky''\u2014''Dobrolubskaya'',\n* ''philosophos'' (one who loves wisdom) \u2192 ''Lubomudrov''\u2014''Lubomudrova'',\n* ''theophilos'' (one who loves God) \u2192 ''Bogolubov''\u2014''Bogolubova''.\n\nMany freed serfs were given surnames after those of their former owners. For example, a serf of the [[Demidov]] family might be named ''Demidovsky'', which translates roughly as \"belonging to Demidov\" or \"one of Demidov's bunch\".\n\nGrammatically, Russian family names follow the same rules as other nouns or adjectives (names ending with ''-oy'', ''-aya'' are grammatically adjectives), with exceptions: some names do not change in different cases and have the same form in both genders (for example, ''Sedykh'', ''Lata'').\n\n===South Slavs===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n\n==== Endings in -i\u0107 and -i\u010d ====\nSurnames of some [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] groups such as [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], and [[Bosniaks]] traditionally end with the suffixes \"-i\u0107\" and \"-vi\u0107\" (often transliterated to English and other western languages as \"ic\", \"ich\", \"vic\" or \"vich\". The v is added in the case of a name to which \"-i\u0107\" is appended would otherwise end with a vowel, to avoid double vowels with the \"i\" in \"-i\u0107\".) These are a diminutive indicating descent i.e. \"son of\". In some cases the family name was derived from a profession (e.g. blacksmith \u2013 \"Kova\u010d\" \u2192 \"Kova\u010devi\u0107\").\n\nAn analogous ending is also common in [[Slovenia]]. As the [[Slovenian language]] does not have the softer consonant \"\u0107\", in Slovene words and names only \"\u010d\" is used. So that people from the former [[Yugoslavia]] need not change their names, in official documents \"\u0107\" is also allowed (as well as \"\u0110 / \u0111\"). Thus, one may have two surname variants, e.g.: Bo\u017ei\u010d, Tom\u0161i\u010d (Slovenian origin or assimilated) and Bo\u017ei\u0107, Tom\u0161i\u0107 (roots from the Serbo-Croat language continuum area). Slovene names ending in -i\u010d do not necessarily have a patrimonial origin.\n\nIn general family names in all of these countries follow this pattern with some family names being typically Serbian, some typically Croat and yet others being common throughout the whole linguistic region.\n\nChildren usually inherit their fathers' family name. In an older naming convention which was common in [[Serbia]] up until the mid-19th century, a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from the father's personal name, and the family name, as seen, for example, in the name of the language reformer [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]].\n\nOfficial family names do not have distinct male or female forms, except in Macedonia, though a somewhat archaic unofficial form of adding suffixes to family names to form female form persists, with ''-eva'', implying \"daughter of\" or \"female descendant of\" or ''-ka'', implying \"wife of\" or \"married to\". In Slovenia the feminine form of a surname (\"-eva\" or \"-ova\") is regularly used in non-official communication (speech, print), but not for official IDs or other legal documents.\n\nBosniak Muslim names follow the same formation pattern but are usually derived from proper names of Islamic origin, often combining archaic Islamic or feudal Turkish titles i.e. Mulaomerovi\u0107, \u0160abanovi\u0107, Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107, etc. Also related to Islamic influence is the prefix ''[[Hajji|Had\u017ei]]-'' found in some family names. Regardless of religion, this prefix was derived from the honorary title which a distinguished ancestor earned by making a pilgrimage to either Christian or Islamic holy places; Had\u017eibegi\u0107, being a Bosniak Muslim example, and Had\u017eianti\u0107 an Orthodox Christian one.\n\nIn [[Croatia]] where tribal affiliations persisted longer, [[Lika]], [[Herzegovina]] etc., originally a family name, came to signify practically all people living in one area, clan land or holding of the nobles. The [[\u0160ubi\u0107]] family owned land around the [[Zrin River]] in the Central Croatian region of [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]]. The surname became [[\u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]], the most famous being [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]].\n\nIn Montenegro and Herzegovina, family names came to signify all people living within one clan or [[Tribes of Montenegro|bratstvo]]. As there exists a strong tradition of inheriting personal names from grandparents to grandchildren, an additional patronymic usually using suffix ''-ov'' had to be introduced to make distinctions between two persons bearing the same personal name and the same family name and living within same area. A noted example is [[Marko Miljanov Popovi\u0107]], i.e. Marko, son of Miljan, from Popovi\u0107 family.\n\nDue to discriminatory laws in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], some Serb families of [[Vojvodina]] discarded the suffix ''-i\u0107'' in an attempt to mask their ethnicity and avoid heavy taxation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe prefix ''Pop-'' in Serbian names indicates descent from a priest, for example [[Gordana Pop Lazi\u0107]], i.e. descendent of Pop Laza.\n\nSome Serbian family names include prefixes of Turkish origin, such as ''Uzun-'' meaning tall, or ''Kara-'', black. Such names were derived from nicknames of family ancestors. A famous example is [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], descendents of \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, known as [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] or Black \u0110or\u0111e.\n\n====Endings -ov and -ski====\nAmong the [[Bulgarians]], another South Slavic people, the typical surname suffix is \"-ov\" (Ivanov, Kovachev), although other popular suffixes also exist.\n\nIn the [[Republic of Macedonia]], the most popular suffix today is \"-ski\".\n\n====Slovenian surnames====\n[[Slovenes]] have a great variety of surnames, most of them differentiated according to region. Surnames ending in -i\u010d are less frequent than among Croats and Serbs. There are typically Slovenian surnames ending in -i\u010d, such as Bla\u017ei\u010d, Stani\u010d, [[Maru\u0161i\u010d]]. Many Slovenian surnames, especially in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], end in -\u010di\u010d (Gregor\u010di\u010d, Kocijan\u010di\u010d, Miklav\u010di\u010d, etc.), which is uncommon for other South Slavic peoples (except the neighboring Croats, e.g. Kova\u010di\u0107, Jela\u010di\u0107, Kranj\u010di\u0107, etc.). On the other hand, surname endings in -ski and -ov are rare, and are usually of foreign (mostly Czech) origin. One of the most typical Slovene surname endings is -nik (Rupnik, Pu\u010dnik, Ple\u010dnik, Poga\u010dnik, Podobnik) and other used surname endings are -lin (Pavlin, Mehlin, Ahlin, Ferlin), -ar (Mlakar, Ravnikar, Smrekar Tisnikar) and -lj (Rugelj, Pucelj, Bagatelj, Bricelj). Many Slovenian surnames are linked to Medieval rural settlement patterns. Surnames like [[Novak]] (literally, \"the new one\") or Hribar (from ''hrib'', hill) were given to the peasants settled in newly established farms, usually in high mountains. Peasant families were also named according to the owner of the land which they cultivated: thus, the surname Kralj (King) or Cesar (Emperor) was given to those working on royal estates, \u0160kof (Bishop) or Vidmar to those working on ecclesiastical lands, etc. Many Slovenian surnames are named after animals (Medved \u2013 bear, Volk, Vovk or Vouk \u2013 wolf, Golob \u2013 pigeon, Lisjak \u2013 fox, Orel \u2013 eagle, Zajc or Zajec \u2013 rabbit, etc.). Many are named after neighbouring peoples: [[Horvat]], Hrovat, or Hrovatin (Croat), Furlan ([[Friulian language|Friulian]]), Nemec (German), Lah (Italian), Vogrin, Vogri\u010d or Vogrin\u010di\u010d (Hungarian), Vo\u0161njak (Bosnian), \u010ceh (Czech), Turk (Turk), or different Slovene regions: Kranjc, Kranjec or Krajnc (from [[Carniola]]), Kra\u0161evec (from the [[Karst Plateau|Kras]]), Koro\u0161ec (from [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]), Ko\u010devar or Ho\u010devar (from the [[Gottschee|Gottschee county]]).\n\n=====Use of feminine surnames in Slovenia=====\nIn '''Slovenia''' last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used. Examples: Novak (m.) & Novakova (f.), Kralj (m.) & Kraljeva (f.), Mali (m.) \u02db& Malijeva (f.) (this is different from the Czech principle, though forexample \"mali\" in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] also means \"small\" the last name is not changed grammatically to \"mala\".) So we have Maja Novak on the ID card and Maja Novak'''ova''' in communication; Tja\u0161a Mali and Tja\u0161a Malij'''eva'''; respectively. Diminutive forms of last names for females are also available: Novakovka, Kraljevka. As for pronunciation, in Slovenian there is some leeway regarding accentuation. Depending on the region or local usage, you may have either N\u00f3vak & N\u00f3vakova or, more frequently, Nov\u00e1k & Nov\u00e1kova. Accent marks are normally not used.\n\n{{further|Bulgarian name|Croatian name|Serbian name|Macedonian names}}\n\n===Ukraine and Belarus===\n{{Main article|Ukrainian name}}\n\nUkrainian and Belarusian names evolved from the same [[Old East Slavic]] and [[Ruthenian language]] (western [[Rus' (people)|Rus\u2019]]) origins. Ukrainian and Belarusian names share many characteristics with family names from other Slavic cultures. Most prominent are the shared root words and suffixes. For example, the root ''koval'' (blacksmith) compares to the Polish ''[[Kowalski|kowal]]'', and the root ''bab'' (woman) is shared with Polish, Slovakian, and Czech. The suffix ''-vych'' (son of) corresponds to the South Slavic ''-vic'', the Russian ''-vich'', and the Polish ''-wicz'', while ''-sky'', ''-ski'', and ''-ska'' are shared with both Polish and Russian, and ''-ak'' with Polish.\n\nHowever some suffixes are more uniquely characteristic to Ukrainian and Belarusian names, especially: ''-chuk'' ([[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]]), ''-enko'' (all other Ukraine) (both son of), ''-ko'' (little [masculine]), ''-ka'' (little [feminine]), ''-shyn'', and ''-uk''. See, for example, [[Mihalko]], Ukrainian Presidents [[Leonid Kravchuk]], and [[Viktor Yushchenko]], Belarusian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]], or former Soviet diplomat [[Andrei Gromyko]]. Such Ukrainian and Belarusian names can also be found in Russia, Poland, or even other Slavic countries (e.g. Croatian general [[Zvonimir \u010cervenko]]), but are due to importation by Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Rusyn ancestors.\n\n==Arabic-speaking countries==\n{{Main article|Arabic name}}\n\nThe given name is always followed by the father's first name, then the father's family surname.\nSome surnames have a prefix of ''ibn''- meaning son of (''ould''- in Mauritania)\nThe surnames follow similar rules defining a relation to a clan, family, place etc.\nSome Arab countries have differences due to historic rule by the Ottoman Empire or due to being a different minority.\n\nA large number of Arabic last names start with \"Al-\" which means \"The\"\n\n'''Arab States of the [[Persian Gulf]]'''.\nNames mainly consist of the person's name followed by the father's first name connected by the word \"ibn\" or \"bin\" (meaning \"son of\"). The last name either refers to the name of the tribe the person belongs to, or to the region, city, or town he/she originates from. In exceptional cases, members of the royal families or ancient tribes mainly, the title (usually H.M./H.E., Prince, or Sheikh) is included in the beginning as a prefix, and the first name can be followed by four names, his father, his grandfather, and great \u2013 grandfather, as a representation of the purity of blood and to show the pride one has for his ancestry.\n\nIn Arabic-speaking [[Levant]]ine countries ([[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]]) it's common to have family names associated with a certain profession or craft, such as \"Al-Haddad\"/\"Haddad\" which means \"Blacksmith\" or \"Al-Najjar\"/\"Najjar\" which means \"Carpenter\".\n\n==South Asia==\n{{further|Indian family names|Pakistani name|Bangladeshi name|List of popular surnames in Nepal}}\n\n===India===\n{{Main article|Indian name}}\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn India, surnames are placed as last names or before first names, which often denote: village of origin, caste, clan, office of authority their ancestors held, or trades of their ancestors.\n\nThe largest variety of surnames is found in the states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]], which numbers more than the rest of India together. Here surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father's name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived from the place where the family lived, with the 'ker' (Marathi) or 'Kar'(Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaiker, Puneker, Aurangabadker or Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in 'e'. These are usually more archaic than the 'Kar's and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.\n\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], surnames usually denote family names. It is easy to track family history and the caste they belonged to using a surname.\n\nIt is a common in [[Kerala]] and some other parts of [[South India]] that the [[spouse]] adopts her husband's [[first name]] instead of his family or surname name after marriage.<ref>[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Indian-Culture-2871/2010/11/NAME-CHANGE-MARRIAGE.htm]</ref>\n\nIndia is a country with numerous distinct cultural and linguistic groups. Thus, Indian surnames, where formalized, fall into seven general types.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSurnames are based on:\n* Patronymics and ancestry, whereby the father's name or an ancestor's given name is used in its original form or in a derived form (e.g. [[Aggarwal (disambiguation)|Aggarwal]] or Agrawal or Agrawala derived from the ancestor Agrasen).\n* Occupations (Chamar, [[Patel]] or Patil, meaning Village Headman, [[Gandhi (surname)|Gandhi]], [[Kamath]], [[Kulkarni]], who used to maintain the accounts and records and collect taxes, [[Kapadia (disambiguation)|Kapadia]], Nadkarni, Patwardhan, Patwari, [[Shenoy]], etc.) and priestly distinctions (Bhat, Bhattar, Sastry, Trivedi, Shukla, Chaturvedi, Twivedi, Purohit, Mukhopadhyay); Business people: Shetty, Rai, Hegde is commonly used in kshatriya castes of the karnataka coastal belt. In addition many [[Parsi people|Parsi]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Bohra]] and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] families have used English trade names as last names since the 18th and 19th centuries (Contractor, Engineer, Builder).\n* [[Caste]] or clan names ([[Pillai (surname)|Pillai]], Gounder, Goud, Gowda, Boyar, Parmar, Sindhi, Vaish, Reddy, Meena and Naidu) are not surnames but suffixes to first names to indicate their clan or caste.\n* Place names or names derived from places of ancestral origin (Aluru, Marwari, Gawaskar, Gaonkar, Mangeshkar, Kapoor, [[Wamankar]], [[Kokradi]], Karnad, Medukonduru, Rachapalli).\n* The father's first name is used as a surname in certain Southern states, such as [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Spouses and children take on the first name of the father as their last name or 'surname'.\n* [[Muslim]] surnames generally follow the same rules used in Pakistan. [[Khan (name)|Khan]] is among the most popular surnames, often signifying [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]]/[[Central Asian]] descent.\n* Bestowed titles or other honorifics: titles bestowed by kings, rajas, nawabs and other nobles before the British Raj (Wali, Rai, [[Rao (surname)|Rao]], [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]], [[Gain (surname)|Gain/Gayen]], Panicker, Vallikappen, Moocken, etc.) and those bestowed by the British (Rai, Bahadur).\n\nThe convention is to write the first name followed by middle names and surname. It is common to use the father's first name as the middle name or last name even though it is not universal. In some Indian states like [[Maharashtra]], official documents list the family name first, followed by a comma and the given names.\n\nTraditionally, wives take the surname of their husband after marriage. In modern times, in urban areas at least, this practice is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband's surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.\n\nJains generally use [[Jain]], [[Shah]], [[Firodia]], [[Singhal]] or [[Gupta (name)|Gupta]] as their last names.\nSikhs generally use the words ''Singh'' (\"lion\") and ''Kaur'' (\"princess\") as surnames added to the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names ([[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered ([[Hukamnama]]) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use ''Singh'' in his name and any woman who considered herself a Sikh must use ''Kaur'' in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.\n\nThe modern-day spellings of names originated when families translated their surnames to English, with no standardization across the country. Variations are regional, based on how the name was translated from the local language to English in the 18th, 19th or 20th centuries during British rule. Therefore, it is understood in the local traditions that Agrawal and Aggarwal represent the same name derived from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab respectively. Similarly, Tagore derives from Bengal while Thakur is from Hindi-speaking areas. The officially recorded spellings tended to become the standard for that family. In the modern times, some states have attempted standardization, particularly where the surnames were corrupted because of the early British insistence of shortening them for convenience. Thus Bandopadhyay became Banerji, Mukhopadhay became Mukherji, Chattopadhyay became Chatterji, etc. This coupled with various other spelling variations created several surnames based on the original surnames. The [[West Bengal]] Government now insists on re-converting all the variations to their original form when the child is enrolled in school.\n\nSome parts of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Indonesia]] have similar patronymic customs to those of India.\n\n===Nepal===\n{{Further|List of popular surnames in Nepal}}\n\nNepali surnames are divided into three origins; [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] and indigenous origins. Surnames of [[Khas community]] contains toponyms as [[Ghimire]], [[Dahal]], [[Pokharel]], [[Sapkota]] from respective villages, occupational names as ([[Adhikari]], [[Bhandari]], [[Karki (surname)|Karki]], [[Thapa]]). Many Khas surnames includes suffix as -wal, -al as in [[Katwal]], Silwal, [[Dulal]], [[Khanal]], [[Khulal]], [[Rijal]]. [[Kshatriya]] titles such as [[Bista]], [[Kunwar (disambiguation)|Kunwar]], [[Rana (title)|Rana]], [[Rawat (title)|Rawat]], [[Rawal]], [[Dhami]], [[Shah]], [[Thakuri]], [[Chand (name)|Chand]], were taken as surnames by various [[Kshetri]] and [[Thakuri]]s. [[Khatri]] Kshetris share surnames with mainstream Pahari [[Bahun]]s. Other popular Chhetri surnames include [[Basnyat]], [[Bogati]], [[Budhathoki]], [[Khadka]], [[Khandayat]], [[Mahat (surname)|Mahat]], [[Raut (disambiguation)|Raut]]. Similarly, [[Brahmin]] surnames such as [[Acharya]], [[Bhatta]], [[Joshi]], [[Pandit]], [[Sharma]], [[Upadhyay]] were taken by Pahari [[Bahun]]s. Jaisi [[Bahun]]s bear distinct surnames as Kattel, Banstola, Jaisi, Padhya and share surnames with mainstream [[Bahun]]s. Other Bahun surnames include [[Aryal]], [[Bhattarai]], [[Banskota]], Chaulagain, [[Devkota]], [[Dhakal]], [[Gyawali]], [[Koirala]], [[Mainali]], [[Pandey]], [[Panta (surname)|Panta]], [[Paudel]], [[Regmi (disambiguation)|Regmi]], [[Subedi]], [[Tiwari]], [[Upreti]]. Many Indian immigrants into [[Pahari, Rajasthan|Pahari]] zone are assimilated under [[Khas people]]s and they carried ancestral clan names as [[Marhatta]], [[Rathore|Rathaur]], [[Chauhan]]. Khas-[[Dalit]]s surnames include [[Kami]], Bishwakarma or B.K., [[Damai]], Mijar, Pariyar, Ranapaheli, [[Sarki (ethnic group)|Sarki]]. [[Newar]] groups of multiethnic background bears both [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] surnames (like [[Shrestha]], [[Joshi]], [[Pradhan]]) and indigenous surnames like [[Maharjan]], [[Dangol]]. [[Magars]] bear surnames derived from [[Khas people]]s such as [[Baral]], [[Budhathoki]], [[Lamichhane]], [[Thapa]] and indigenous origins as Dura, Gharti, Pun, Pulami. Other Himalayan Mongoloid castes bears Tibeto-Burmese surnames like [[Gurung]], [[Tamang]], Thakali, Sherpa. Various [[Kiranti]] ethnic group contains many Indo-Aryan surnames of [[Khas]] origin which were awarded by the government of Khas peoples. These surnames are [[Rai (ethnic group)|Rai]], [[Subba (disambiguation)|Subba]], Jimmi, [[Dewan]] depending upon job and position hold by them. [[Terai]] community consists both [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] and Indigenous origin surnames. Terai [[Brahmin]]s bears surnames as [[Jha (surname)|Jha]], [[Mishra]], [[Pandit]], [[Tiwari]]. Terai [[Rajput]] and other [[Kshatriya]] groups bears the surnames [[Chauhan]], [[Singh]], [[Rajput]], [[Verma]], [[Pal (surname)|Pal]]. [[Marwari people|Marwari]] surnames like [[Agrawal]], [[Jain]], [[Khandelwal (surname)|Khandelwal]], [[Maheshwari]], Tapadia are also common. [[Nepalese Muslims]] bears Islamic surnames such as [[Ali]], [[Ansari (nesba)|Ansari]], [[Begum]], [[Khan (surname)|Khan]], [[Mohammad]], [[Pathan]]. Other common Terai surnames are [[Yadav]], [[Mahato]], [[Kamat]], [[Thakur (Bengali surname)|Thakur]], [[Dev (disambiguation)|Dev]], [[Chaudhary]], [[Kayastha]].\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Main article|Pakistani name|List of Pakistani family names}}\n\nPakistani surnames are basically divided in three categories: [[Pakistani name|Arab naming convention]], tribal or caste names and ancestral names.\n\nFamily names indicating [[Arab]] ancestry, e.g. [[Shaikh]], [[Siddiqui]], [[Abbasi (disambiguation)|Abbasi]], [[Syed]], [[Zaidi (surname)|Zaidi]], [[Khawaja]], [[Naqvi (disambiguation)|Naqvi]], [[Farooqi]], [[Osmani]], [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]], [[Hassani]], and [[Husseini]].\n\nPeople claiming [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ancestry include those with family names [[\u0681\u0627\u0681\u064a dz\u0101dzi]] [[Durrani]], [[Gardezi]], [[Suri (Pashtun)|Suri]], [[Yousafzai]], [[Afridi]], [[Mullagori]], [[Mohmand]], [[Khattak]], [[Wazir (disambiguation)|Wazir]], [[Mehsud]], [[Niazi]].\n\nFamily names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] heritage include [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]],(cheema) [[Baig]] or [[Baig|Beg]], [[Pasha]], [[Barlas]], and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuki]].\n\nPeople claiming Indian ancestry include those with family names [[Barelwi]], [[Lakhnavi]], [[Delhvi]], [[Bilgrami]] and [[Muslim Rajputs|Rajput]].\n\nPeople claiming [[Iran]]ian ancestry include those with family names [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)#Other uses|Agha]], [[Bukhari (nesbat)|Bukhari]], [[Firdausi]], [[Ghazali]], [[Gilan]]i, [[Hamadani (surname)|Hamadani]], [[Isfahani]], [[Kashani]], [[Kirmani|Kermani]], [[Khorasani (disambiguation)|Khorasani]], [[Farooqui]], [[Mir]], [[Mirza]], [[Montazeri]], [[Nishapuri]], [[Noorani]], [[Kayani (name)|Kayani]], [[Qizilbash]], [[Saadi (disambiguation)|Saadi]], [[Sabzvari]], [[Shirazi (disambiguation)|Shirazi]], [[Sistani (disambiguation)|Sistani]], [[Suhrawardi (disambiguation)|Suhrawardi]], [[Yazdani (disambiguation)|Yazdani]], [[Zahedi (disambiguation)|Zahedi]], and [[Zand tribe|Zand]].\n\nTribal names include [[Abro]] [[Afaqi]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]], [[Khogyani (tribe)|Khogyani]]([[Khogyani (tribe)|Khakwani]]), [[Amini (surname)|Amini]],[Ansari] [[Ashrafkhel]], [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]], [[Bajwa]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Barakzai]], [[Baranzai]], [[Bhatti]], [[Bhutto]], [[Ranjha clan|Ranjha]], [[Bijarani]], [[Bizenjo]], [[Brahui people|Brohi]], [[Khetran]], [[Bugti]], [[Butt (tribe)|Butt]], [[Farooqui]], [[Gabol]], [[Ghaznavi (surname)|Ghaznavi]], [[Ghilzai]], [[Gichki]], [[Gujjar]], [[Jamali (surname)|Jamali]], [[Jamote]], [[Janjua]], [[Jatoi (tribe)|Jatoi]], [[Jutt]] [[Joyo (tribe)|Joyo]], [[Junejo]], [[Karmazkhel]], Kayani, [[Khar (tribe)|Khar]], [[Khattak]], [[Khuhro]], [[Lakhani (name)|Lakhani]], [[Leghari]], [[Lodhi]], Magsi, [[Malik]], [[Mandokhel]], [[Meo|Mayo]], [[Marwat]], [[Mengal]], Mughal, [[Palijo]], Paracha, [[Panhwar]], [[Phul]], [[Popalzai]], [[Qureshi & qusmani]], [[Rabbani (disambiguation)|Rabbani]], [[Raisani]], [[Rakhshani (disambiguation)|Rakhshani]], [[Sahi clan|Sahi]], [[Swati (tribe)|Swati]], [[Soomro]], [[Sulaimankhel]], [[Talpur]], [[Talwar]], [[Thebo]], [[Yousafzai]], and [[Zamani (disambiguation)|Zamani]].\n\nFamily names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]]/ [[Kurd]] ancestry, [[Dogar]].\nIn Pakistan, the official paperwork format regarding personal identity is as follows:\n\nSo and so, son of so and so, of such and such tribe or clan and religion and resident of such and such place. For example, Amir Khan s/o Fakeer Khan, tribe Mughal Kayani or Chauhan Rajput, Follower of religion Islam, resident of Village Anywhere, Tehsil Anywhere, District.\n\nA large number of [[Muslim Rajputs]] have retained their [[surnames]] such as [[Chauhan]], [[Rathore]], [[Parmar]], and [[Janjua]].\n\n==East Asia==\n{{further|Chinese surname|Japanese name|Korean name#Family names|Vietnamese name}}\n\nIn modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, the family name is placed before the given names, although this order may not be observed in translation. Generally speaking, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese names do ''not'' alter their order in English ([[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Ho Chi Minh]]) and Japanese names do ([[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]]).<ref>Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzKBXxnkURkC&pg=PA632 pp. 632 ff]. M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}.</ref> However, numerous exceptions exist, particularly for people born in English-speaking countries such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. This is sometimes systematized: in all Olympic events, the athletes of the [[People's Republic of China]] list their names in the Chinese ordering, while Chinese athletes representing other countries, such as the United States, use the Western ordering.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} (In Vietnam, the system is further complicated by the cultural tradition of addressing people by their given name, usually with an honorific. For example, [[Phan V\u0103n Kh\u1ea3i]] is ''properly'' addressed as Mr.&thinsp;Kh\u1ea3i, even though Phan is his family name.)\n\nChinese family names have many types of origins, some claiming dates as early as the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] (2nd millennium BC):\n* from the land or state that one lived in or awarded: [[Chen (surname)|Chen \u9673]] after the [[Chen (state)|state of Chen]], [[Cai (surname)|Cai \u8521]] after the [[state of Cai]];\n* from the given name or [[Posthumous name]] of one's ancestor: [[Zhuang (surname)|Zhuang \u838a]] after [[King Zhuang of Chu]];\n* from the [[Chinese nobility|nobility status]] or [[officer status]] of one's ancestor: [[Wang (surname)|Wang \u738b]] (a king) or [[Shi (surname)|Shi \u53f2]] (a history-recording officer);\n* and some other origins.\n\nIn history, some changed their surnames due to a [[naming taboo]] (from Zhuang \u838a to Yan \u56b4 during the era of [[Emperor Ming of Han|Liu Zhuang \u5289\u838a]]) or as an award by the Emperor ([[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]] was often to senior officers during [[Tang dynasty]]).\n\nIn modern times, some Chinese adopt an [[English name]] in addition to their native given names: e.g., {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|\u674e\u67f1\u9298}} (''Li Zh\u00f9m\u00edng'')}} adopted the English name [[Martin (name)|Martin]] Lee. Particularly in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], the convention is to write both names together: [[Martin Lee Chu-ming]]. Owing to the confusion this can cause, a further convention is sometimes observed of capitalizing the surname: Martin L{{sc|EE}} Chu-ming. Sometimes, however, the Chinese given name is forced into the Western system as a middle name (\"Martin Chu-ming Lee\"); less often, the English given name is forced into the Chinese system (\"Lee Chu-ming Martin\").\n\nIn Japan, the civil law forces a common surname for every married couple, unless in a case of international marriage. In most cases, women surrender their surnames upon marriage, and use the surnames of their husbands. However, a convention that a man uses his wife's family name if the wife is an only child is sometimes observed. A similar tradition called ''ru zhui'' (\u5165\u8d05) is common among Chinese when the bride's family is wealthy and has no son but wants the heir to pass on their assets under the same family name. The Chinese character ''zhui'' (\u8d05) carries a money [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] (\u8c9d), which implies that this tradition was originally based on financial reasons. All their offspring carry the mother's family name. If the groom is the first born with an obligation to carry his own ancestor's name, a compromise may be reached in that the first male child carries the mother's family name while subsequent offspring carry the father's family name. The tradition is still in use in many Chinese communities outside [[mainland China]], but largely disused in China because of social changes from communism. Due to the economic reform in the past decade, accumulation and inheritance of personal wealth made a comeback to the Chinese society. It is unknown if this financially motivated tradition would also come back to mainland China.\n\nIn Chinese, Korean, and Singaporean cultures, women keep their own surnames, while the family as a whole is referred to by the surnames of the husbands.\n\nIn Hong Kong, some women would be known to the public with the surnames of their husbands preceding their own surnames, such as [[Anson Chan|Anson Chan Fang On Sang]]. Anson is an English given name, On Sang is the given name in Chinese, Chan is the surname of Anson's husband, and Fang is her own surname. A name change on legal documents is not necessary. In Hong Kong's English publications, her family names would have been presented in small cap letters to resolve ambiguity, e.g. Anson C<small>HAN</small> F<small>ANG</small> On Sang in full or simply Anson Chan in short form.\n\nIn [[Macau]], some people have their names in Portuguese spelt with some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] style, such as ''Carlos do Rosario Tchiang''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carlos.com.hk/carlos.htm |title=Carlos do Rosario Tchiang (home page)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702024930/http://carlos.com.hk/carlos.htm |archivedate=2007-07-02}}</ref>\n\nChinese women in Canada, especially [[Hongkonger]]s in [[Toronto]], would preserve their [[maiden name]]s before the surnames of their husbands when written in English, for instance Rosa Chan Leung, where Chan is the maiden name, and Leung is the surname of the husband.\n\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], surnames are predominantly monosyllabic (written with one [[Chinese characters|character]]), though a small number of common [[Chinese compound surname|disyllabic (or written with two characters) surnames]] exists (e.g. the Chinese name ''Ouyang'', the Korean name ''Jegal'' and the Vietnamese name ''Phan-Tran'').\n\nMany Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames are of the same origin, but simply pronounced differently and even transliterated differently overseas in Western nations. For example, the common Chinese surnames Chen, Chan, Chin, Cheng and Tan, the Korean surname Jin, as well as the Vietnamese surname Tr\u1ea7n are often all the same exact character \u9673. The common Korean surname Kim is also the common Chinese surname Jin, and written \u91d1. The common Mandarin surnames Lin or Lim (\u6797) is also one and the same as the common Cantonese or Vietnamese surname ''Lam'' and Korean family name Lim [[Korean phonology|(written/pronounced as Im in South Korea]]). There are people with the surname of Hayashi (\u6797) in Japan too. The common Chinese surname \u674e, translated to English as Lee, is, in Chinese, the same character but transliterated as Li according to [[pinyin]] convention. Lee is also a common surname of Koreans, and the character is identical.\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{Main article|Vietnamese name}}\n40% of all [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] have the surname [[Nguyen]]. This may be because when a new dynasty took power in Vietnam it was custom to adopt that dynasty's surname. The last dynasty in Vietnam was the [[Nguyen dynasty]], so as a result many people have this surname.\n\n== Africa ==\n\n===East Africa===\nIn several [[Northeast Bantu languages]] such as [[Kamba language|Kamba]], [[Taita language|Taita]] and [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]] in [[Kenya]] the word \"wa\" (meaning \"of\") is inserted before the surname, for instance, Mugo wa Kibiru ([[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]) and Mekatilili wa Menza ([[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]]).\n\n===Burundi and Rwanda===\nIn [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], most, if not all surnames have God in it, for example Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (I thank God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth). But not all surnames end with the suffix -imana. Irakoze is one of these (technically meaning Thank God, though it is hard to translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.\n\n=== Ethiopia and Eritrea ===\n{{Main article|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}\n\nThe patronymic custom in most of the [[Horn of Africa]] gives children the father's first name as their surname. The family then gives the child its first name. Middle names are unknown. So, for example, a person's name might be ''Bereket Mekonen ''. In this case, ''Bereket '' is the first name and ''Mekonen'' is the surname, and also the first name of the father.\n\nThe paternal grandfather's name is often used if there is a requirement to identify a person further, for example, in school registration. Also, different cultures and tribes use the father's or grandfather's given name as the family's name. For example, some Oromos use Warra Ali to mean families of Ali, where Ali, is either the householder, a father or grandfather.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the customs surrounding the bestowal and use of family names is as varied and complex as the cultures to be found there. There are so many cultures, nations or tribes, that currently there can be no one formula whereby to demonstrate a clear pattern of Ethiopian family names. In general, however, Ethiopians use their father's name as a surname in most instances where identification is necessary, sometimes employing both father's and grandfather's names together where exigency dictates.\n\nMany people in Eritrea have Italian surnames, but all of these are owned by [[Italian Eritreans|Eritreans of Italian descent]].\n\n==Other countries==\n\n===Albania===\nA full Albanian name consists of a given name ({{lang-sq|em\u00ebr}}), patronymic ({{lang-sq|at\u00ebsi}}) and family name ({{lang-sq|mbiem\u00ebr}}), for example ''Agron Mark Gjoni''. The patronymic is simply the given name of the individual's father, with no suffix added. The family name is typically a noun in the definite form or at the very least ends with a vowel or -j (an approximant close to -i). Many traditional last names end with -aj (previously -anj), which is more prevalent in certain regions of Albania and Kosovo.\n\nProper names in Albanian are fully declinable like any noun (e.g. ''Marinelda'', genitive case ''i/e Marineld\u00ebs'' \"of Marinelda\").\n\n===Armenia===\n[[Armenian surnames]] almost always have the ending ({{lang-hy|\u0575\u0561\u0576}}) transliterated into English as -yan or -ian (spelled -ean (\u0565\u0561\u0576) in Western Armenian and pre-Soviet Eastern Armenian, of Ancient [[Armenia]]n or [[Iran]]ian origin, presumably meaning \"son of\"), though names with that ending can also be found among Persians and a few other nationalities. Armenian surnames can derive from a geographic location, profession, noble rank, personal characteristic or personal name of an ancestor. Armenians in the diaspora sometimes adapt their surnames to help assimilation. In Russia, many have changed -yan to -ov (or -ova for women). In Turkey, many have changed the ending to -o\u011flu (also meaning \"son of\"). In English and French-speaking countries, many have shortened their name by removing the ending (for example [[Charles Aznavour]]). In ancient Armenia, many noble names ended with the locative -t'si (example, [[Moses of Chorene|Khorenatsi]]) or -uni ([[Bagratuni (disambiguation)|Bagratuni]]). Several modern Armenian names also have a Turkish suffix which appears before -ian/-yan: -lian denotes a placename; -djian denotes a profession. Some Western Armenian names have a particle Der, while their Eastern counterparts have Ter. This particle indicates an ancestor who was a priest (Armenian priests can choose to marry or remain celibate, but married priests cannot become a bishop). Thus someone named Der Bedrosian (Western) or Ter Petrosian (Eastern) is a descendent of an Armenian priest. The convention is still in use today: the children of a priest named Hagop Sarkisian would be called Der Sarkisian. Other examples of Armenian surnames: Adonts, Sakunts, Vardanyants, Rshtuni.\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nTraditional Azeri surnames usually end with \"-l\u0131\", \"-lu\", (Turkic for 'with' or 'belonging to'), \"-o\u011flu\", \"-q\u0131z\u0131\" (Turkic for 'son of' and 'daughter of'), \"-zade\" (Persian for 'born of'). Azerbaijanis of Iranian descent traditionally use suffixes such as '-pour' or '-zadeh', meaning 'born of' with their father's name. It is, however, more usual for them to use the name of the city in which their ancestors lived (e.g. Tabrizpour for those from Tabriz) or their occupation (e.g. Damirchizadeh for blacksmiths). Also, due to it being a part of the Russian Empire, many last names carry Slavic endings of \"-ov\" for men and \"-ova\" for women. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Georgia===\n{{Main article|List of Georgian surnames}}\n\nMost eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] surnames end with the suffix of \"-shvili\", (e.g. Kartveli'shvili) Georgian for \"child\" or \"offspring\". Western Georgian surnames most commonly have the suffix \"-dze\", (e.g. [[:ka:\u10da\u10d0\u10d1\u10d0\u10eb\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8|Laba'dze]]) Georgian for \"son\". [[Megrelian]] surnames usually end in \"-ia\", \"-ua\" or \"-ava\". Other location-specific endings exist: In [[Svaneti]] \"-iani\", meaning \"belonging to\", or \"hailing from\", is common. In the eastern Georgian highlands common endings are \"uri\" and \"uli\". Some noble family names end in \"eli\", meaning \"of (someplace)\".\nIn [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the surname is not normally used as the polite form of address; instead, the given name is used together with a title. For instance, Nikoloz Kartvelishvili is politely addressed as ''bat'ono Nikoloz'' \"My Lord. Nikoloz\".\n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n{{Main article|Greeks#Surnames}}\n\nGreek surnames are most commonly patronymics. Occupation, characteristic, or ethnic background and location/origin-based surnames names also occur; they are sometimes supplemented by nicknames.\n\nCommonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine [[proper nouns]] in the [[nominative case]]. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the [[genitive case]] of this proper noun for patronymic reasons.\n\nAlthough surnames are static today, dynamic and changing patronym usage survives in middle names in Greece where the genitive of the father's first name is commonly the middle name.\n\nBecause of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have [[Katharevousa]] forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris, and former vernacular practice (prefixing the surname to the proper name) was to call John Eleutherios '''Leftero-giannis'''.\n\nModern practice is to call the same person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive. However, children are almost always baptised with the archaic form of the name so in official matters the child will be referred to as Ioannis Eleftheriou and not Giannis Eleftheriou.\n\nFemale surnames are most often in the Katharevousa genitive case of a male name. This is an innovation of the Modern Greek state; Byzantine practice was to form a feminine counterpart of the male surname (e.g. masculine Palaiologos, Byzantine feminine Palaiologina, Modern feminine Palaiologou).\n\nIn the past, women would change their surname when married to that of their husband (again in genitive case) signifying the transfer of \"dependence\" from the father to the husband. In earlier Modern Greek society, women were named with '''''-aina''''' as a feminine suffix on the husband's first name: \"Giorgaina\", \"Mrs George\", \"Wife of George\". Nowadays, a woman's legal surname does not change upon marriage, though she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though in rare cases, if the bride and groom have agreed before the marriage, the children can receive the maternal surname.\n\nSome surnames are prefixed with '''''Papa-''''', indicating ancestry from a priest, e.g. ''Papageorgiou'', the \"son of a priest named George\". Others, like '''''Archi-''''' and '''''Mastro-''''' signify \"boss\" and \"[[tradesman]]\" respectively.\n\nPrefixes such as '''''Konto-''''', '''''Makro-''''', and '''''Chondro-''''' describe body characteristics, such as \"short\", \"tall/long\" and \"fat\". ''Gero-'' and ''Palaio-'' signify \"old\" or \"wise\".\n\nOther prefixes include '''''[[hajji|Hadji]]-''''' (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ae- or \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9-) which was an honorific deriving from the Arabic [[Hadj]] or pilgrimage, and indicate that the person had made a pilgrimage (in the case of Christians, to Jerusalem) and '''''Kara-''''' which is attributed to the Turkish word for \"black\" deriving from the [[Ottoman Empire]] era. The Turkish suffix '''''-oglou''''' (derived from a patronym, ''-o\u011flu'' in Turkish) can also be found. Although they are of course more common among Greece's Muslim minority, they still can be found among the Christian majority, often Greeks or [[Karamanlides]] who were pressured to leave Turkey after the Turkish Republic was founded (since Turkish surnames only date to the founding of the Republic, when Atat\u00fcrk made them compulsory).\n\n[[Arvanitic]] surnames also exist; an example is ''Tzanavaras'' or ''Tzavaras'', from the Arvanitic word ''\u00e7anavar'' or ''\u00e7avar'' meaning \"brave\" (''pallikari'' in Greek).<ref>Tzavaras, Ath.: \"Agapite Aderfe Vasileie\", Ekdosis Exantas, Athens 1999</ref>\n\nMost Greek patronymic suffixes are diminutives, which vary by region. The most common Hellenic patronymic suffixes are:\n* '''''-poulos/-poulou''''', which has a Latin origin (''pullus'') and means \"the little\", representing \"the son of ...\", so if a man's family name is \"Christopoulos\", it means that his father was named \"Christos\". This suffix is very widespread throughout Greece and is originally from the [[Peloponessus]] in particular.\n* '''''-idis/iadis/antis''''' The suffix '''''-idis''''' (often transliterated ''-ides'' in English and French) is the oldest in use. [[Zeus]], for example, was also referred to as ''[[Cronides]]'' (\"son of [[Cronus]]\"). A common suffix in Byzantium around [[Bithynia]] and [[Byzantine Thrace]] (Constantinople), also used by [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] in the [[Pontic Alps]], northeast [[Anatolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the former [[Russian Caucasus]] region of [[Kars Oblast]] e.g. ''Mikhailidis'', the \"clan of Michael\"\n* '''''-akis/-aki''''' is associated primarily with [[Crete]] and the [[Aegean Islands]]. It is a patronymic signifying \"little\" and/or \"son\"; therefore ''Theodorakis'' is \"little Theodore\".\n\nOthers, less common, are:\n* '''''-atos/-atou''''' (from [[Cephallonia]] and other [[Ionian Islands]])\n* '''''-as/-a/-ekas/kas''''' (from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]) and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]\n* '''''-ellis/-elli''''' (from [[Lesbos Island|Lesvos Island]])\n* '''''-eas/akos/oggonas''''' (from [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]])\n* '''''-oglou''''' (from the Turkish suffix for \"child of\" used by both genders)\n* '''''-ou''''' (genitive, from [[Cyprus]])\n* '''''-ou/ides/kos''''' (from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]])\n* '''''-ekas/las''''' (from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]])\n\nEither the surname or the given name may come first in different contexts; in newspapers and in informal uses, the order is ''given name + surname'', while in official documents and forums (tax forms, registrations, military service, school forms), the surname is often listed or said first.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{further|Hungarian name|Hungarian language#Name order}}\n\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], like Asian languages but unlike most other European ones (see French and German above for exceptions), the family name is placed before the given names. This usage does not apply to non-Hungarian names, for example \"Tony Blair\" will remain \"Tony Blair\" when written in Hungarian texts.\n\nNames of Hungarian individuals, however, appear in Western order in English writing.\n\n\n\n===Indonesia===\nIndonesians comprise more than 300 ethnic groups. Not all of these groups traditionally have surnames, and in the populous [[Java]] surnames are not common at all \u2013 regardless of which one of the [[Religion in Indonesia|six officially recognized religions]] the name carrier profess. For instance, a Christian Javanese woman named ''Agnes Mega Rosalin'' has three forenames and no surname. \"Agnes\" is her Christian name, but \"Mega\" can be the first name she use and the name which she is addressed with. \"Rosalin\" is only a middle name. Nonetheless, Indonesians are well aware of the custom of family names, which is known as ''marga'' or ''fam'', and such names have become a specific kind of identifier. People can tell what a person's heritage is by his or her family or clan name.\n* The various ethnicities of [[Batak people]] from North Sumatra are known for their strict tradition of preserving their family names, which are actually clan names. See [[Marga (Batak)]] for details.\n* The [[matrilineal]] clan names of the [[Minangkabau people]] are passed down from mothers to their children. Minangkabau is the largest matrilineal society in the world.\n* The [[Minahasan]] people of North Sulawesi have an extensive list of surnames, such as ''Toar, Lumimuut, Emor, Muntuan, Nayoan, Wenas'' and ''Luntungan''.\n* The [[Ambonese]] people of the Maluku Islands have family names such as ''Lawalata, Matulessy'' and ''Latumahina''.\n* The various ethnicities of [[Dayak people]] from the provinces in [[Kalimantan]] have surnames such as ''Dau'' and ''Narang''.\n* The [[Bugis]] people from South Sulawesi have surnames such as ''Mappanyukki, Mallarangeng'' and ''Matalatta''.\n* Among the [[Toraja]] people of South Sulawesi, common surname elements include ''Rante\u2013, Pong\u2013, Allo\u2013, \u2013bua, \u2013linggi''. Examples: ''Rantedatu, Ranteallo, Pongrambu, Pongtiku, Pongrangga, Allodatu, Randebua, Tanabua, Tarukbua, Datubua, Allobua, Senolinggi''.\n\n[[Java (island)|Javanese]] people are the majority in Indonesia, and most do not have any surname. There are some individuals, especially old generation, who have only one name, such as \"[[Suharto]]\" and \"[[Sukarno]]\". These are not only common with the Javanese but also with other Indonesian ethnic groups who do not have the tradition of surnames. If, however, they are Muslims, they might opt to follow [[Arabic name|Arabic naming]] customs, but Indonesian Muslims don't automatically follow Arabic name traditions.\n\nIn conjunction with migration to Europe or America, Indonesians without surnames often adopt a surname based on some family name or middle name. The forms for [[Visa (document)|visa]] application many Western countries use, has a square for writing the last name which cannot be left unfilled by the applicant.\n\nMost [[Chinese Indonesian]]s substituted their Chinese surnames with Indonesian-sounding surnames due to political pressure from 1965 to 1998 under Suharto's regime.\n\n===Iranian/Persian/Kazan===<!-- Other pages link here, so please don't change the heading unless you also check and update them -->\nPersian last names may be:\n* Simple nouns; e.g. Afshar (\"Of [[Afsharid dynasty]]\"), [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Bahar]], [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m|Khayyam]]\n* Noun plus a suffix; e.g. Golzaar (Gol + -zaar), Amouzgaar (Amouz + - gaar), [[Khosrau I|Daadgar]] (Daad + -gar)\n* More complex compound nouns; e.g. Bolurfrushan (Bolur + Frush + -an), [[Ahmedinejad]] (Ahmed + -i + -nejad), [[Farshchian]] (Farsh + -chi + -an)\n* Two or more nouns; e.g. [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Hashemi Rafsanjani]]\n\nSuffixes include: -an (plural suffix), -i (\"of\"), -zad/-zadeh (\"born of\"), -pur (\"son of\"), -nejad (\"from the race of\"), -nia (\"descendant of\"), -mand (\"having or pertaining to\"), -vand (\"succeeding\"), -far (\"holder of\"), -doost (\"[[:wiktionary:-phile#English|-phile]]\"), -khah (\"seeking of\"), -mannesh (\"having the manner of\"), -ian/-yan, -gar and -chi (\"whose vocation pertains\").\n\nAn example is names of geographical locations plus \"-i\": Irani (\"Iranian\"), Gilani (\"of [[Gilan]] province\"), Tabrizi (\"of the city of [[Tabriz]]\").\n\nAnother example is last names that indicate relation to religious groups such as [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrian]] (e.g. Goshtaspi, Namiranian, Azargoshasp), [[Persian Jews|Jewish]] (e.g. Yaghybian [Jacobean], Hayyem [Life], Shaul [Saul]) or [[Muslim]] (e.g. Alavi, Islamnia, [[Montazeri]])\n\nLast names are arbitrary; their holder need not to have any relation with their meaning.\n\nTraditionally in Iran, the wife does not take her husband's surname, although children take the surname of their father. Individual reactions notwithstanding, it is possible to call a married woman by her husband's surname. This is facilitated by the fact that English words \"Mrs.\", \"Miss\", \"Woman\", \"Lady\" and \"Wife (of)\" in a polite context are all translated into \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645\" (Khaanom). Context, however, is important: \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u06af\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\" (Khaanom Goldust) may, for instance, refer to the daughter of Mr. Goldust instead of his wife.\nWhen most of Iranian surnames are used with a name, the name will be ended with a suffix _E or _ie (of) such as Hasan_e roshan (Hasan is name and roshan is surname) that means Hasan of Roshan or Mosa_ie saiidi (Muses of saiidi). The _e is not for surname and it is difficult to say it is a part of surname.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main article|Italian surname}}\n\nItaly has around 350,000 surnames. Most of them derive from the following sources: [[patronym]] or [[wikt:ilk|ilk]] (e.g. ''Francesco di Marco'', \"Francis, son of Mark\" or ''[[Eduardo de Filippo]]'', \"Edward belonging to the family of Philip\"), occupation (e.g. ''[[Enzo Ferrari]]'', \"Heinz (of the) Blacksmiths\"), personal characteristic (e.g. nicknames or pet names like ''Dario Forte'', \"Darius the Strong\"), geographic origin (e.g. ''Elisabetta Romano'', \"Elisabeth from Rome\") and objects (e.g. ''Carlo Sacchi'', \"Charles Bags\"). The two most common Italian family names, ''Russo'' and ''Rossi'', mean the same thing, \"Red\", possibly referring to a hair color that would have been very distinctive in Italy.\n\nBoth Western and Eastern orders are used for full names: the given name usually comes first, but the family name may come first in administrative settings; lists are usually indexed according to the last name.\n\nSince 1975, women have kept their own surname when married, but until recently (2000){{dubious|reason=No given reference to such a reform. The relevant rule, article 143 bis of Italian Civil Code, stays unchanged since 1975.|date=November 2013}} they could have added the surname of the husband according to the civil code, although it was a very seldom-used practice. In recent years, the husband's surname cannot be used in any official situation.{{dubious|reason=No given reference to such a reform. The relevant rule, article 143 bis of Italian Civil Code, stays unchanged since 1975.|date=November 2013}}<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.jus.unitn.it/cardozo/Obiter_Dictum/codciv/Lib1.htm Italian Civil Code, art. 143 bis]</ref> In some unofficial situations, sometimes both surnames are written (the proper first), sometimes separated by ''in'' (e.g. ''Giuseppina Mauri in Crivelli'') or, in case of widows, ''ved.'' (''vedova'').\n\n===Latvia===\n{{Main article|Latvian name}}\n\nLatvian male surnames usually end in ''-s'', ''-\u0161'' or ''-is'' whereas the female versions of the same names end in ''-a'' or ''-e'' or ''s'' in both unmarried and married women.\n\nBefore the emancipation from serfdom (1817 in [[Courland]], 1819 in [[Vidzeme]], 1861 in [[Latgale]]) only noblemen, free craftsmen or people living in towns had surnames. Therefore, the oldest Latvian surnames originate from German or Low German, reflecting the dominance of German as an official language in Latvia till the 19th century. Examples: ''Meijers/Meijere'' (German: ''Meier'', farm administrator; akin to Mayor), ''Millers/Millere'' (German: ''M\u00fcller'', miller), ''\u0160mits/\u0160mite'' (German: ''Schmidt'', smith), ''\u0160ulcs/\u0160ulca'' (German: ''Schulze'', constable), ''Ulmanis'' (German: ''Ullmann'', a person from [[Ulm]]), ''Godmanis'' (a God-man), ''P\u0113tersons'' (son of Peter). Some Latvian surnames, mainly from Latgale are of Polish or Belorussian origin by changing the final ''-ski/-cki'' to ''-skis/-ckis'', ''-czyk'' to ''-\u010diks'' or ''-vich/-wicz'' to ''-vi\u010ds'', such as ''Sokolovkis/Sokolovska'', ''Baldun\u010diks/Baldun\u010dika'' or ''Ratkevi\u010ds/Ratkevi\u010da''.\n\nMost Latvian peasants received their surnames in 1826 (in [[Vidzeme]]), in 1835 (in [[Courland]]), and in 1866 (in [[Latgale]]). Diminutives were the most common form of family names. Examples: ''Kalni\u0146\u0161/Kalni\u0146a'' (small hill), ''B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161/B\u0113rzi\u0146a'' (small birch).\n\nNowadays many Latvians of Slavic descent have surnames of Russian, Belarusian, or Ukrainian origin, for example ''Volkovs/Volkova'' or ''Anto\u0146enko''.\n\n===Libya===\nLibya's names and surnames have a strong Islamic/Arab nature, with some Turkish influence from Ottoman Empire rule of nearly 400 years.\nAmazigh, Touareg and other minorities also have their own name/surname traditions.\nDue to its location as a trade route and the different cultures that had their impact on Libya throughout history, one can find names that could have originated in neighboring countries, including clan names from the Arabian Peninsula, and Turkish names derived from military rank or status (''Basha'', ''Agha'').\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{Main article|Lithuanian name}}\n\nLithuanian names follow the Baltic distinction between male and female suffixes of names, although the details are different. Male surnames usually end in ''-a'', ''-as'', ''-aitis'', ''-ys'', ''-ius'', or ''-us'', whereas the female versions change these suffixes to ''-ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117'', and ''-ut\u0117'' respectively (if unmarried), ''-ien\u0117'' (if married), or ''-\u0117'' (not indicating the marital status). Some Lithuanians have names of Polish or another Slavic origin, which are made to conform to Lithuanian by changing the final ''-ski'' to ''-skas'', such as ''Sadauskas'', with the female version bein -''skait\u0117'' (if unmarried), ''-skien\u0117'' (if married), or ''-sk\u0117'' (not indicating the marital status).\n\n===Malta===\nDifferent cultures have their impact on the demographics of the Maltese islands, and this is evident in the various surnames Maltese citizens bear nowadays.<ref>http://en.geneanum.com/malta/documents/genealogy/maltese-surnames.html</ref> There are very few ''Maltese'' surnames per se: the few that originate from Maltese places of origin include ''Chircop'' ([[Kirkop]]), ''Lia'' ([[Lija]]), ''Balzan'' ([[Balzan]]), ''Valletta'' ([[Valletta]]), and ''Sciberras'' (Xebb ir-Ras Hill, on which Valletta was built). The village of [[Munxar]], [[Gozo]] is characterised by the majority of its population having one of two surnames, either ''Curmi'' or ''de Brincat''. In Gozo, the surnames ''Bajada'' and ''Farrugia'' are also common.\n* '''[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and Italian surnames'''\nSicilian and Italian surnames are common due to the close vicinity to Malta. Sicilian Italians were the first to colonise the Maltese islands. Common examples include ''Azzopardi'', ''Bonello'', ''Cauchi'', ''[[Farrugia]]'', ''[[Gauci]]'', ''Rizzo'', ''[[Schembri]]'', ''Tabone'', ''Vassallo'', ''Vella''.\n* '''French surnames'''\nCommon examples include ''Depuis'', ''Montfort'', ''Monsenuier'', ''Tafel''.\n* '''English surnames'''\nEnglish surnames exist for a number of reasons, but mainly due to migration as well as Malta forming a part of the British Empire in the 19th century and most of the 20th. Common examples include ''Bone'', ''Harding'', ''Atkins'', ''Mattocks'', ''Smith'', ''Jones'', ''Woods'', ''Turner''.\n* '''[[Siculo-Arabic|Sicilian Arabic]] surnames'''\nArabic surnames occur in part due to the early presence of the Arabs in Malta. Common examples include ''Sammut'', ''Camilleri'', ''Zammit'', and ''Xuereb''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cassar |first=Mario |url=https://ema-ps.academia.edu/MarioCassar/Papers/99102/Vestiges_of_Arabic_Nomencalture_in_Maltese_Surnames |title=Vestiges of Arabic Nomenclature in Maltese Surnames &#124; Mario Cassar - Academia.edu |publisher=Ema-ps.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n* '''Spanish surnames'''\nCommon surnames of Spanish origin include ''Abela'', ''Galdes'', ''Herrera'', and ''Guzman''.\n* '''German surnames'''\nSurnames from foreign countries from the Middle Ages include German,<br />\nsuch as ''von Brockdorff'', ''Hyzler'', and ''Schranz''.\n* '''Greek surnames'''\nMany of the earliest Maltese surnames are Sicilian Greek, e.g. ''Cilia'', ''Calleia'', ''Brincat'', ''Cauchi''. Much less common are recent surnames from Greece; examples include ''Dacoutros'', and ''Trakosopoulos''\n* '''Jewish surnames'''\nThe original Jewish community of Malta and Gozo has left no trace of their presence on the islands since they were expelled in January 1493.\n* '''Customs'''\nIn line with the practice in other Christian, European states, women generally assume their husband's surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear. Some women opt to retain their old name, for professional/personal reasons, or combine their surname with that of their husband.\n\n===Mongolia===\n{{Main article|Mongolian name}}\n\nMongolians do not use surnames in the way that most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics \u2013 then called ''ovog'', now called ''etsgiin ner'' \u2013 are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in [[genitive]] case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial \u2013 Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj ''guai'' \u2013 Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are usually just kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.\n\nSince 2000, Mongolians have been officially using [[List of medieval Mongolian tribes and clans|clan names]] \u2013 ''ovog'', the same word that had been used for the patronymics before \u2013 on their IDs. Many people chose the names of the ancient clans and tribes such [[Borjigin]], Besud, [[Jalair]], etc. Also many extended families chose the names of the native places of their ancestors. Some chose the names of their most ancient known ancestor. Some just decided to pass their own given names (or modifications of their given names) to their descendants as clan names. Some chose other attributes of their lives as surnames. [[J\u00fcgderdemidiin G\u00fcrragchaa|G\u00fcrragchaa]] chose Sansar (Cosmos). Clan names precede the patronymics and given names, e.g. Besud Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.<ref>[http://www.mongoleiservice.de/mongolei__gesellschaft/mongolei__gesellschaft.html Hans Peter Vietze: Mongolische Namen (in German)]</ref> These clan names have a significance and are included in Mongolian passports.\n\n===Myanmar (Burma)===\n{{Main article|Burmese name}}\n\nPeople from Myanmar or Burmese, have no family names. This, to some, is the only known Asian people having no family names at all. Some of those from Myanmar or Burma, who are familiar with European or American cultures, began to put to their younger generations with a family name \u2013 adopted from the notable ancestors. For example, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the late Father of Independence General Aung San; [[Hayma Ne Win]], is the daughter of the famous actor [[Kawleikgyin Ne Win]] etc.\n\n\n\n===The Philippines===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main article|Filipino name}}\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, there was no standardization of surnames in the [[Philippines]]. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, as well as those who took certain surnames simply because they had a certain prestige, usually ones related to the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] religion, such as [[de los Santos]] (\"of the saints\") and [[Delacruz|de la Cruz]] (\"of the cross\").\n\nOn 21 November 1849, the Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa]], decreed an end to these arbitrary practices, the systematic distribution of surnames to Filipinos without prior surnames and the universal implementation of the Spanish naming system. This produced the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' (\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\"), which listed permitted surnames with origins in Spanish, Filipino, and Hispanicised Chinese words, names, and numbers. Thus, many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the rest of the Hispanophone world. Surnames with connections to nobility, either Spanish or local, however, was explicitly prohibited, and only allowed to be retained by families with noble status or having the surname used in three consecutive generations. The book contained many words coming from Spanish and the Philippine languages such as Tagalog, as well as many [[Basque surnames]] such as Zuloaga or Aguirre.\n\nThe colonial authorities implemented this decree because too many (early) Christianized Filipinos assumed religious names. There soon were too many people surnamed \"de los Santos\", \"de la Cruz\", \"[[del Rosario]]\" (\"of the Rosary\"), \"[[Bautista]]\" (\"Baptist\"), et cetera, which made it difficult for the Spanish colonists to control the Filipino people, and most importantly, to collect taxes. These extremely common names were also banned by the decree unless the name has been used by a family for at least four generations. This Spanish naming custom also countered the native custom before the Spanish period, wherein siblings assumed different surnames. Claver\u00eda's decree was enforced to different degrees in different parts of the colony.\n\nBecause of this implementation of [[Spanish naming customs]], of the arrangement \"given name - paternal surname - maternal surname\", in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.\n\nIn practice, the application of this decree varied from municipality to municipality. Most municipalities received surnames starting with only one initial letter, but some are assigned surnames starting with two or three initial letters. For example, the majority of residents of the island of [[Banton, Romblon|Banton]] in the province of Romblon have surnames starting with F such as ''Fabicon'', ''Fallarme'', ''Fadrilan'', and ''Ferran''. Other examples are case of Batangas, Batangas (present-day [[Batangas City]]), where most residents bear surnames starting with the letters A, B, and C, such as ''Abacan'', ''Albayalde'', ''Almarez'', ''Andal'', ''Arce'', ''Arceo'', ''Arguelles'', ''Arrieta'', ''Babasa'', ''Balmes'', ''Basco'', ''Baylosis'', ''Berberabe'', ''Biscocho'', ''Blanco'', ''Borbon'', ''Calingasan'', ''Caringal'', ''Chavez'', ''Cuenca'', and ''Custodio'' (in addition to some bearing native Tagalog surnames, such as ''Dimaano'', ''Dimacuha'', ''Macatangay'', ''Malabanan'', and ''Marasigan''), and [[Argao, Cebu|Argao]], [[Cebu]], where most residents bear surnames starting with ''VI'' and ''Al'', such as ''Villaluz'', ''Villaflor'', ''Villamor'', ''Villanueva'', ''Albo'', ''Alcain'', ''Alcarez'', ''Algones'', etc.\n\nThus, although perhaps a majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry. In addition, most Filipinos currently do not use Spanish accented letters in their Spanish derived names. The lack of accents in Filipino Spanish has been attributed to the lack of accents on the predominantly American typewriters after the US gained control of the Philippines.\n\nThe vast majority of Filipinos follow a naming system in the American order (i.e. given name - middle name - surname), which is the reverse of the Spanish naming order (i.e. given name - paternal surname - maternal surname). Children take the mother's surname as their [[middle name]], followed by their father's as their surname; for example, a son of Juan de la Cruz and his wife Mar\u00eda Agbayani may be David Agbayani de la Cruz. Women usually take the surnames of their husband upon marriage, and consequently lose their maiden middle names; so upon her marriage to David de la Cruz, the full name of Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg would become Laura Macaraeg de la Cruz. Their maiden last names automatically become their middle names upon marriage.\n\nThere are other sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, which in some cases could indicate Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanicised Chinese numerals and other Hispanicised Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the ''Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos''. For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanicised Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor's surname as well as the name of that ancestor's godparent on receiving Christian baptism.\n\nIn the predominantly [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] areas of the southern Philippines, adoption of surnames was influenced by Islamic religious terms. As a result, surnames among Filipino Muslims are largely Arabic-based, and include such surnames as [[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]] and Haradji.\n\nThere are also Filipinos who, to this day, have no surnames at all, particularly if they come from indigenous cultural communities.\n\n====Naming customs in the Philippines====\nPrior to the establishment of the Philippines as a US territory during the earlier part of the 20th century, Filipinos usually followed Iberian naming customs. However, upon the promulgation of the Family Code of 1987, Filipinos formalized adopting the American system of using their surnames.\n\nA common Filipino name will consist of the given name (mostly 2 given names are given), the initial letter of the mother's maiden name and finally the father's surname (i.e. Lucy Anne C. de Guzman). Also, women are allowed to retain their maiden name or use both her and her husband's surname as a [[double-barreled surname]], separated by a dash. This is common in feminist circles or when the woman holds a prominent office (e.g. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]]). In more traditional circles, especially those who belong to the prominent families in the provinces, the custom of the woman being addressed as \"Mrs. Husband's Full Name\" is still common.\n\nFor widows, who chose to marry again, two norms are in existence. For those who were widowed before the Family Code, the full name of the woman remains while the surname of the deceased husband is attached. That is, Maria Andres, who was widowed by Ignacio Dimaculangan will have the name Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan. If she chooses to marry again, this name will still continue to exist while the surname of the new husband is attached. Thus, if Maria marries Rene de los Santos, her new name will be Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos.\n\nHowever, a new norm is also in existence. The woman may choose to use her husband's surname to be one of her middle names. Thus, Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos may also be called Maria A.D. de los Santos.\n\nChildren will however automatically inherit their father's surname if they are considered legitimate. If the child is born out of wedlock, the mother will automatically pass her surname to the child, unless the father gives a written acknowledgment of paternity. The father may also choose to give the child both his parents' surnames if he wishes (that is Gustavo Paredes, whose parents are Eulogio Paredes and Juliana Angeles, while having Maria Solis as a wife, may name his child Kevin S. Angeles-Paredes.\n\nIn some Tagalog regions, the norm of giving patronyms, or in some cases matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of course not official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited. It is not uncommon to refer to someone as Juan anak ni Pablo (John, the son of Paul) or Juan apo ni Teofilo (John, the grandson of Theophilus).\n\n===Romania===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n{{main article|Romanian names}}\nIn [[Romania]], like in most of Europe, it is customary for a child to take his father's family name, and a wife to take her husband's last name. However, this is not compulsory - spouses and parents are allowed to choose other options too, as the law is flexible (see Art. 282,<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-282-alegerea-numelui-de-familie-formalitatile-pentru-incheierea-casatoriei-incheierea-casatoriei</ref> Art. 449 <ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-449-numele-copilului-din-casatorie-situatia-legala-a-copilului-filiatia</ref> Art. 450.<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-450-numele-copilului-din-afara-casatoriei-situatia-legala-a-copilului-filiatia</ref> of the [[Civil Code of Romania]]).\n\nUntil the 19th century, the names were primarily of the form \"[given name] [father's name] [grandfather's name]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/seesscm/romanian-personal-names|title=Romanian Personal Names|last=|first=|date=15 October 2015|website=Slavic Cataloging Manual|access-date=}}</ref> The few exceptions are usually famous people or the nobility (boyars). The name reform introduced around 1850 had the names changed to a western style, most likely imported from France, consisting of a given name followed by a family name.\n\nAs such, the name is called ''prenume'' (French ''pr\u00e9nom''), while the family name is called ''nume'' or, when otherwise ambiguous, ''nume de familie'' (\"family name\"). Although not mandatory, middle names are common.\n\nHistorically, when the family name reform was introduced in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a [[matronym]] when the father was dead or unknown. A common convention was to append the suffix ''-escu'' to the father's name, e.g. ''Anghelescu'' (\"''Anghel's'' child\") and ''Petrescu'' (\"''Petre's'' child\"). (The ''-escu'' seems to come from Latin ''-iscum'', thus being cognate with Italian ''-esco'' and French ''-esque''.) Another common convention was to append the suffix ''-eanu'' to the name of the place of origin, e.g. ''Munteanu'' (\"from the mountains\") and ''Moldoveanu'' (\"from ''Moldova''\"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.\n\nThere are also descriptive family names derived from occupations, nicknames, and events, e.g. ''Botezatu'' (\"baptised\"), ''Barbu'' (\"bushy bearded\"), ''Prodan'' (\"foster\"), ''B\u0103lan'' (\"blond\"), ''Fieraru'' (\"smith\"), ''Croitoru'' (\"tailor\"), \"[[P\u0103curaru]]\" (\"shepherd\").\n\nRomanian family names remain the same regardless of the sex of the person.\n\nAlthough given names appear before family names in most Romanian contexts, official documents invert the order, ostensibly for filing purposes. Correspondingly, Romanians occasionally introduce themselves with their family names first, e.g. a student signing a test paper in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbiic.gov/public/2008/nov/Naming_practice_guide_UK_2006.pdf|title=A Guide to Names and Naming Practices|last=United Kingdom|first=|date=March 2006|website=Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nRomanians bearing names of non-Romanian origin often adopt Romanianised versions of their ancestral surnames, such as ''Jurovschi'' for Polish ''\u017burowski'', which preserves the original pronunciation of the surname through transliteration. In some cases, these changes were mandated by the state.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{See also|Turkish name#Surnames}}\n\nIn Turkey, following the [[Surname Law]] imposed in 1934 in the context of [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms]], every family living in Turkey was given a family name. The surname was generally selected by the elderly people of the family and could be any [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word (or a permitted word for families belonging to official minority groups).\n\nSome of the most common family names in Turkey are ''[[Y\u0131lmaz]]'' ('undaunted'), ''[[Do\u011fan]]'' ('falcon'), ''[[\u015eahin]]'' ('hawk'), ''[[Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (disambiguation)|Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m]]'' ('thunderbolt'), ''[[\u015eim\u015fek]]'' ('lightning'), ''[[\u00d6zt\u00fcrk]]'' ('purely Turkish').\n\n[[Patronymic]] surnames do not necessarily refer to ancestry, or in most cases cannot be traced back historically. The most usual Turkish patronymic suffix is ''\u2013o\u011flu''; ''\u2013ov(a)'', ''\u2013yev(a)'' and ''\u2013zade'' also occur in the surnames of Azeri or other Turkic descendants.\n\nOfficial minorities like Armenians, Greeks, and Jews have surnames in their own mother languages.\nThe Armenian families living in Turkey usually have Armenian surnames and generally have the suffix ''\u2013yan'', ''\u2013ian'', or, using Turkish spelling, ''-can''. Greek descendants usually have Greek surnames which might have Greek suffixes like ''\u2013ou'', ''\u2013aki(s)'', ''\u2013poulos/poulou'', ''\u2013idis/idou'', ''\u2013iadis/iadou'' or prefixes like ''papa\u2013''.\nThe Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain and settled in Turkey in 1492 have both Jewish/Hebrew surnames, and Spanish surnames, usually indicating their native regions, cities or villages back in Spain, like ''De Leon'' or ''Toledano''.\n\nHowever these minorities increasingly tend to \"Turkicize\" their surnames or replace their original surnames with Turkish surnames altogether to avoid being recognized and discriminated against.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|Appendix:Names}}\n\n{{Personal names by culture}}\n{{Personal names}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family name}}\n[[Category:Family|Name]]\n[[Category:Surname]]\n[[Category:Genealogy]]\n[[Category:Surnames by culture| ]]", "sha1": "gjpjjsjxh0caxrhwbycgnwf2ga104ki"}}, {"title": "Franc", "ns": "0", "id": "10815", "revision": {"id": "862565231", "parentid": "862526122", "timestamp": "2018-10-05T06:08:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rosbif73", "id": "10009733"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/72.36.26.200|72.36.26.200]] ([[User talk:72.36.26.200|talk]]) to last revision by Eyesnore.

The [[French franc]] was the currency of [[France]] until the [[euro]] was adopted in 1999 (by law, 2002 de facto). The [[Swiss franc]] is a major world currency today due to the prominence of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Banking in Switzerland|financial institutions]]. The name is said to derive from the [[Latin]] inscription ''francorum rex'' ([[Style of the French sovereign]]: ''King of the [[Franks]]'') used on  early [[France|French]] coins  and until the 18th century, or from the [[French language|French]] ''franc'', meaning \"frank\" (and \"free\" in certain contexts, such as ''coup franc'', \"free kick\" ).\n\nThe countries that use francs include [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], and most of [[Francophone Africa]]. Before the introduction of the euro, francs were also used in France, [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], while [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] accepted the French franc as [[legal tender]] ([[Monegasque franc]]). The franc was also used within the [[French colonial empires|French Empire]]'s colonies, including [[Algeria]] and [[Cambodia]]. The franc is sometimes Italianised or Hispanicised as the ''franco'', for instance in [[Luccan franco]].\n\nOne franc is typically divided into 100 [[centime]]s. The French franc symbol was an F with a line through it (\u20a3) or, more frequently, only an F. For practical reasons, the banks and the financial markets used the abbreviation '''FF''' for the French franc in order to distinguish it from the Belgian franc (FB), the Luxembourgish franc (FL or FLux), et cetera. In the Luxembourgish language, the word for franc is ''Frang'', plural form ''Frangen''.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Franc a cheval de Jean le Bon 5 decembre 1360 or 3730mg.jpg|thumb|left|The first franc ever minted, the ''franc \u00e0 cheval'', was minted upon [[John II of France|Jean le Bon]]'s return from captivity from 5 December 1360, and featured combative imagery. Gold, 24 [[Fineness#Karat|karat]]s, 3.73&nbsp;g. It conveniently coincided with the account value of one [[livre tournois]].]]\nThe franc was originally a French [[gold]] coin of 3.87&nbsp;g minted in 1360 on the occasion of the release of King [[John II of France|John II (\"the good\")]], held by the English since his capture at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] four years earlier. It was equivalent to one ''[[livre tournois]]'' (Tours pound).\n\n==French franc==\nThe [[French franc]] was the name of a gold coin issued in [[France]] from 1360 until 1380,<ref>L. Ciani, Les Monnaies Royales Fran\u00e7aises (1926) p.77 and p.92</ref> then a silver coin issued between 1575 and 1641.<ref>L. Ciani, Les Monnaies Royales Fran\u00e7aises (1926) p.314 and p.356</ref> The franc finally became the national currency from 1795 until 1999 (franc coins and notes were legal tender until 2002).  Though abolished as a legal coin by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] in 1641 in favor of the gold [[louis (coin)|louis]] and silver [[\u00e9cu (coin)|\u00e9cu]], the term franc continued to be used in common parlance for the [[livre tournois]].  The franc was also minted for many of the former French colonies, such as Morocco, Algeria, French West Africa, and others.  Today, after independence, many of these countries continue to use the franc as their standard denomination.\n\nThe value of the French franc was locked to the [[euro]] at 1 euro = 6.55957 FRF on 31 December 1998, and after the [[introduction of the euro]] notes and coins, ceased to be legal tender after 28 February 2002, although they were still exchangeable at banks until 19 February 2012.<ref>https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/rfd/1954/235/rfd235.pdf</ref>\n\n==CFA and CFP francs==\nFourteen African countries use the [[CFA franc|franc CFA]] (in west Africa, ''Communaut\u00e9 financi\u00e8re africaine''; in equatorial Africa, ''Coop\u00e9ration financi\u00e8re en Afrique centrale''), originally (1945) worth 1.7 French francs and then from 1948, 2 francs (from 1960: 0.02 new franc) but after January 1994 worth only 0.01 French franc. Therefore, from January 1999, 1 CFA franc is equivalent to \u20ac0.00152449.\n\nA separate ([[CFP franc|franc CFP]]) circulates in [[Islands controlled by France in the Indian and Pacific oceans#Pacific Islands|France's Pacific territories]], worth \u20ac0.0084 (formerly 0.055 French franc).\n\n==Comorian franc==\nIn 1981, The [[Comoros]] established an arrangement with the French government similar to that of the CFA franc.  Originally, 50 [[Comorian franc]]s were worth 1 French franc.  In January 1994, the rate was changed to 75 Comorian francs to the French franc.  Since 1999, the currency has been pegged to the euro.\n\n==Belgian franc and Luxembourgish franc==\n{{main article|Belgian franc|Luxembourgish franc}}\nThe conquest of most of western Europe by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France led to the franc's wide circulation. Following independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the new Kingdom of [[Belgium]] in 1832 adopted its own Belgian franc, equivalent to the French one, followed by [[Luxembourg]] adopting the Luxembourgish franc in 1848 and Switzerland in 1850. Newly unified [[Italy]] adopted the [[Italian lira|lira]] on a similar basis in 1862.\n\nIn 1865, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy created the [[Latin Monetary Union]] (to be joined by Spain and Greece in 1868): each would possess a national currency unit (franc, lira, peseta, drachma) worth 4.5&nbsp;g of silver or {{val|0.290322|u=g}} of gold (fine), all freely exchangeable at a rate of 1:1. In the 1870s the gold value was made the fixed standard, a situation which was to continue until 1914.\n\nIn 1926 [[Belgium]] as well as France experienced depreciation and an abrupt collapse of confidence, leading to the introduction of a new gold currency for international transactions, the ''belga'' of 5 francs, and the country's withdrawal from the monetary union, which ceased to exist at the end of the year. The 1921 monetary union of Belgium and Luxembourg survived, however, forming the basis for full economic union in 1932.\n\nLike the French franc, the Belgo-Luxemburgish franc ceased to exist on 1 January 1999, when it became fixed at 1&nbsp;EUR = 40.3399&nbsp;BEF/LUF, thus a franc was worth \u20ac0.024789.  Old franc coins and notes lost their legal tender status on 28 February 2002.\n\n1 Luxembourgish franc was equal to 1 Belgian franc. Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg, and Luxembourgish francs were legal tender in the whole of Belgium. (In reality, Luxembourgish francs were only accepted as means of payment by shops and businesses in the Belgian province of Luxembourg adjacent to the independent Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, this for historical reasons.)\n\nThe equivalent name of the Belgian franc in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Belgium's other official language, was ''Belgische Frank''. As mentioned before, in Luxembourg the franc was called ''Frang'' (plural ''Frangen'').\n\n[[Image:Where the Franc is used.jpg|thumb|Countries where the franc is the official currency]]\n\n==Swiss franc and Liechtenstein franc==\nThe [[Swiss franc]] ([[ISO 4217|ISO code]]: CHF or 756), which appreciated significantly against the new European currency from April to September 2000, remains one of the world's strongest currencies, worth today around five-sixths of a euro. The Swiss franc is used in [[Switzerland]] and in [[Liechtenstein]]. Liechtenstein retains the ability to mint its own currency, the [[Liechtenstein franc]], which it does from time to time for commemorative or emergency purposes.\n\nThe name of the country \"Swiss Confederation\" is found on some of the coins in [[Latin]] (''Confoederatio Helvetica''), as Switzerland has four official languages, all of which are used on the notes. The denomination is abbreviated \"Fr.\" on the coins which is the abbreviation in all four languages.\n\n==Saar franc==\nThe [[Saar franc]], linked at par to the French franc, was introduced in the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar Protectorate]] in 1948.  On 1 January 1957, the territory joined the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], nevertheless, in its new [[States of Germany|member state]] of [[Saarland]], the Saar franc continued to be the currency until 6 July 1959.\n\nThe name of the Saar franc in [[German language|German]], the main official language in the Protectorate, was ''Franken''. Coins displaying German inscriptions and the coat of arms of the Protectorate were circulated and used together with French francs.  As banknotes, only French franc bills existed.\n\n==Countries that use a franc==\n\n=== Countries currently using a franc ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Countries\n! Currency\n!

This practice is called [[fractional-reserve banking]]. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [[lender of last resort]] when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel]] laureate [[Milton Friedman]], believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Federal Reserve Board\">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/Speeches/2003/20031024/default.htm | format=text | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

It is briefly described in ''The Federal Reserve System{{nsmdns}}Purposes and Functions'' as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency{{nsmdns}}that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted{{nsmdns}}but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.}}\n\n====Lender of last resort====\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [[lender of last resort]] to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector \"clearing houses\" which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm?js=0#l lender of last resort], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]], Retrieved May 21, 2010,</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Humphrey|first1=Thomas M.|title=Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History|ssrn=2125371|publisher=Social Science Research Network|date=1 January 1989}}</ref>\n\n====Fluctuations====\nThrough its [[discount window]] and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).\n\nBy making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.<ref name=\"dfeverydayecon\"/> For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [[American International Group]] (AIG).<ref name=\"Federal Reserve-AIG Press Release-2008-09-16\">{{cite web | url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm | title=Press Release: Federal Reserve Board, with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) | date=September 16, 2008 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16\">\n{{cite news | first=Edmund L. | last= Andrews |first2= Michael J. |last2=de la Merced |first3=Mary Williams |last3=Walsh | title= Fed's $85 Billion Loan Rescues Insurer | date=September 16, 2008 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html | newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate =September 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Central bank===\n{{Further|Central bank}}\n[[File:Onedolar2009series.jpg|right|thumb|Obverse of a Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] issued in 2009]]\n\nIn its role as the [[central bank]] of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [[Coins of the United States dollar|coin]] and [[Federal Reserve note|paper currency]]. The U.S. Treasury, through its [[United States Mint|Bureau of the Mint]] and [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value.

The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.\n\nFederal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [[federal reserve note]]s. Private banks maintain their [[bank reserves]] in federal reserve accounts.\n\n===Bank regulation===\nThe Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [[Donald L. Kohn]], vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20061103a.htm | title=Speech \u2013 Kohn, The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.\n\nThe legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.}}\n\nThe balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\n====Government regulation and supervision====\n[[File:House Financial Services Committee hearing with Ben Bernanke.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Bernanke (lower-right), former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a [[House Financial Services Committee]] hearing on February 10, 2009.

Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.\n\nMembers of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [[congressional committee]]s on the economy, [[monetary policy]], [[Bank regulation|banking supervision and regulation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], [[financial market]]s, and other matters.\n\nThe Board has regular contact with members of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [[President of the United States]] and has regular meetings with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.}}\n\n=====Regulatory and oversight responsibilities=====\nThe board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in United States Code:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/301- | title=U.S. Code Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 7, Section 301. Powers and duties of board of directors; suspension of member bank for undue use of bank credit | publisher=Law.cornell.edu | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.}}\n\n===National payments system===\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients{{nsmdns}}individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the [[Fedwire|Fedwire Funds Service]] and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.\n\n==Structure==\n{{Main|Structure of the Federal Reserve System}}\n[[File:FederalReserve System.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Organization of the Federal Reserve System]]\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has a \"unique structure that is both public and private\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Role of the Federal Reserve System|url=http://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2005/Pianalto_20051005.cfm|website=Innovation and Education: Renewing the Northeast Ohio Economy|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]]|accessdate=June 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315065708/http://clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2005/Pianalto_20051005.cfm|archivedate=March 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}{{cite web |url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about%20us/who%20we%20are.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208042053/https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about%20us/who%20we%20are.aspx |archivedate=December 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and is described as \"[[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent within the government]]\" rather than \"[[Privatization|independent of government]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm|website=Who Owns the Federal Reserve?|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}</ref> The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal.<ref name=FRBPhilPubPriv>[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/teachers/resources/fed-today/fed-today_lesson-3.pdf \"Is The Fed Public Or Private?\"] [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]].

These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion.

The [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]] gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.<ref name=\"mp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm | title= Federal Open Market Committee | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 22, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"mpb\">[http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm Federal Reserve Education \u2013 Monetary Policy Basics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153340/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm |date=January 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Interbank lending===\nThe Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the [[federal funds rate]], which is the rate of interbank lending of [[excess reserves]]. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [[interbank lending market|interbank market]] and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three \"tools\" of monetary policy described in the [[Federal Reserve System#Monetary policy|''Tools'' section]] below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005:\n\n{{quote|The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks...By conducting [[open market operations]], imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives.<ref name=\"BoG 2005 pp=27\"/>}}\n\nEffects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.<ref>{{cite web | title=Federal Reserve System in Action | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | accessdate=November 24, 2012 | year=2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019011327/http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nThere are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks:<ref name=\"mp\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Tool\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Open market operations]]\n|Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities{{nsmdns}}the Federal Reserve's principal tool for implementing monetary policy.

This is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [[federal funds]], which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.\n\nOpen market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [[United States Treasury security]], sometimes called \"Treasury bills\" or more informally \"T-bills\" or \"Treasuries\". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions.<ref name=\"FRB of NY\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operations | publisher=New York Federal Reserve Bank |date=August 2007 | accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows:<ref name=\"mpb\"/>\n\n{{quote|Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with{{nsmdns}}the primary dealers{{nsmdns}}compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.\n\nOpen market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.\n\nThe Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos){{nsmdns}}the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.}}\n\n=====Repurchase agreements=====\n{{Further|Repurchase agreement}}\n\nTo smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [[Primary dealers|primary dealer's]] reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [[primary dealer]]'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html | title=Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of New York | website=Ny.frb.org |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Discount rate====\n{{Further|Discount window}}\n\nThe Federal Reserve System also directly sets the \"discount rate\", which is the interest rate for \"discount window lending\", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 [[basis point]]s above the target federal funds rate.

All depository institutions that are judged to be in sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow at the discount window are also eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All TAF credit must be fully collateralized. Depositories may pledge the broad range of collateral that is accepted for other Federal Reserve lending programs to secure TAF credit.

By removing \"excess deposits\" from participating banks, the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced, which should result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve has stated that:\n\n{{quote| Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves when policymakers judge that it is appropriate to begin moving to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy. The development of the TDF is a matter of prudent planning and has no implication for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100430a.htm | title=Federal Reserve Board approves amendments to Regulation D authorizing Reserve Banks to offer term deposits | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=April 30, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five \"small-value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100510b.htm | title=Board authorizes small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=May 10, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100908a.htm | title=Board authorizes ongoing small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=September 8, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy. As stated in Bloomberg News:\n\n{{quote| Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than $1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation. The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy, even as a weakening near-term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet.<ref>{{cite news | last = Zumbrun | first = Joshua | title = Fed to Sell Term Deposits to Ensure Exit 'Readiness' | work = Bloomberg | date = September 8, 2010 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-08/fed-to-sell-5-billion-of-term-deposits-to-ensure-readiness-.html | accessdate = September 10, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms:\n\n{{quote| Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....\n\nAs an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.\n\nWhen these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.<ref>[http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 Testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding \"Unwinding Emergency Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs and Implications for Economic Recovery.\" March 25, 2010.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007044419/http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 |date=October 7, 2010 }} https://web.archive.org/web/20151015224731/http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087, also at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/useftp.cgi?IPaddress=162.140.64.184&filename=56764.pdf&directory=/diska/wais/data/111_house_hearings GPO Access Serial No. 111\u2013118] Retrieved September 10, 2010</ref>}}\n\n=====Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility=====\nThe Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF.

The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market {{as of|2008|October|1|lc=y}}, according to the most recent data from the Fed.

[[Paul Warburg]], an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was \"bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties\".<ref name=\"Warburg document\">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3815 |title=Paul Warburg's Crusade to Establish a Central Bank in the United States |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis}}</ref> After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the \"Aldrich Plan\", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible.<ref name=\"Warburg document\"/> The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"ecresearch\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/Files/Documents/Research/3328/EEB198405-REVISED1993.pdf |title=America's Unknown Enemy: Beyond Conspiracy |publisher=American Institute of Economic Research}}</ref>\n\nAldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan,<ref name=\"ecresearch\" /> but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the \"eastern establishment\".<ref name=\"mnglass\">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/88-08/reg888a.cfm |title=Born of a panic: Forming the Federal Reserve System |date=August 1988 |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516102508/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/88-08/reg888a.cfm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/born-of-a-panic-forming-the-fed-system</ref> In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street's control of the American currency supply.<ref name=\"ecresearch\" /> Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control.<ref name=\"ecresearch\" />\n\nThe original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress.<ref name=\"Warburg document\" /> Nonetheless, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications.

It used to be known as [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[caesium]]. It is extremely [[radioactive]]; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called [[actinium]] K after the natural [[decay chain]] it appears in), has a half-life of only 22&nbsp;minutes. It is the second-least [[electronegative]] element, behind only caesium,<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS, IT IS CORRECT. SEE BELOW. FRANCIUM IS VERY HEAVY, SO THE 7S ELECTRON MOVES SO FAST THAT YOU MUST INCLUDE RELATIVITY! THE EFFECT IS A STABILIZATION OF THE 7S ORBITAL, ENOUGH TO BRING THE ELECTRONEGATIVITY UP ABOVE CAESIUM'S!--> and is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|second rarest]] naturally occurring element (after [[astatine]]). The isotopes of francium decay quickly into [[astatine]], [[radium]], and [[radon]]. As an [[alkali metal]], it has one [[valence electron]].\n\nBulk francium has never been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.\n\nFrancium was discovered by [[Marguerite Perey]] in [[France]] (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.{{efn|Some synthetic elements, like [[technetium]] and [[plutonium]], have later been found in nature.}} Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] ores, where the [[isotope]] francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20\u201330&nbsp;g (one ounce) exists at any given time throughout the [[Earth's crust]]; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.<ref name=chemnews/>\n\n==Characteristics==\nFrancium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a [[half-life]] of only 22&nbsp;minutes. The only comparable element is [[astatine]], whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56&nbsp;seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1&nbsp;hours.<ref name=\"andyscouse\" /> All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, [[radium]], or [[radon]].<ref name=\"andyscouse\">{{cite web| last = Price| first = Andy| title = Francium| date = December 20, 2004| url = http://www.andyscouse.com/pages/francium.htm| accessdate = February 19, 2012}}</ref> Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, [[dubnium]].<ref name=\"CRC2006\">{{Cite book |date =2006 |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |volume = 4|page= 12|publisher = CRC|isbn= 0-8493-0474-1}}</ref>\n\nFrancium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium.<ref name=\"CRC2006\" /> A heavy element with a single [[valence electron]],<ref>{{cite web| last = Winter| first = Mark| title = Electron Configuration| work = Francium| publisher = The University of Sheffield| url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Fr/eneg.html| accessdate = April 18, 2007}}</ref> it has the highest [[equivalent weight]] of any element.<ref name=\"CRC2006\" /> Liquid francium\u2014if created\u2014should have a [[surface tension]] of 0.05092&nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]]/m at its melting point.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Kozhitov| first = L.

In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of [[potassium]], another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, [[potassium-40]]).<ref name=\"fontani\">{{cite conference| first = Marco| last = Fontani |authorlink= Marco Fontani | title = The Twilight of the Naturally-Occurring Elements: Moldavium (Ml), Sequanium (Sq) and Dor (Do)| booktitle = International Conference on the History of Chemistry| pages = 1\u20138| date = September 10, 2005| location = Lisbon|url = http://5ichc-portugal.ulusofona.pt/uploads/PaperLong-MarcoFontani.doc| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224090117/http://5ichc-portugal.ulusofona.pt/uploads/PaperLong-MarcoFontani.doc|archivedate=February 24, 2006|accessdate = April 8, 2007}}</ref> He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element ''russium'' after his home country.<ref name=\"vanderkroft\">{{cite web| last = Van der Krogt| first = Peter| title = Francium| work = Elementymology & Elements Multidict| date = January 10, 2006| url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Fr| accessdate = April 8, 2007}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of [[Odessa]], and he did not pursue the element further.<ref name=\"fontani\"/>\n\nThe following year, English chemists [[Gerald J.

Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name ''moldavium'', along with the symbol Ml, after [[Moldavia]], the Romanian province where Hulubei was born.<ref name=\"vanderkroft\"/> In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist [[F. H. Hirsh Jr.]], who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[bismuth]] X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], [[Nobel Prize]] winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over [[Marguerite Perey]]'s recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87.<ref name=\"fontani\"/> All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.<ref name=\"vanderkroft\" />\n\n===Perey's analysis===\nEka-caesium was discovered in 1939 by [[Marguerite Perey]] of the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]] in [[Paris]], when she purified a sample of [[actinium]]-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220&nbsp;keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being [[thorium]], radium, [[lead]], bismuth, or [[thallium]]. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.<ref name=\"chemeducator\" /> Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of [[beta decay]] to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.<ref name=\"mcgraw\" />\n\nPerey named the new isotope ''actinium-K'' (it is now referred to as francium-223)<ref name=\"chemeducator\" /> and in 1946, she proposed the name ''catium'' (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most [[electronegativity|electropositive]] [[cation]] of the elements. [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]], one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of ''cat'' rather than ''cation''; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to [[curium]].<ref name=\"chemeducator\"/> Perey then suggested ''francium'', after France. This name was officially adopted by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in 1949,<ref name=\"andyscouse\" /> becoming the second element after [[gallium]] to be named after France.

The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10<sup>23</sup> neutrons/cm<sup>2</sup> within a microsecond, i.e. about 10<sup>29</sup> neutrons/(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5{{e|15}} neutrons/(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at [[Enewetak Atoll]] for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.<ref name=s39>Seaborg, p. 39</ref>\n\n[[File:ActinideExplosionSynthesis.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Estimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.<ref name=s40/>]]\nThe atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge. They were less successful in terms of yield that was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Isolation of the products was found to be rather problematic, as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of 300\u2013600 meters, and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.<ref name=s39/><ref name=s40>Seaborg, p. 40</ref>\n\nAmong the nine underground tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], 1962), Kennebec (<5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38 kilotons, 1964), Barbel (<20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (<20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969),<ref>[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615000000/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }}, DOE/NV--209-REV 15, December 2000</ref> the last one was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates.<ref name=s40/> The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4{{e|-14}} of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10<sup>\u22127</sup> of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.<ref name=s43>Seaborg, p. 43</ref> In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.<ref name=s44>Seaborg, p. 44</ref>\n\nAlthough no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories. So 6{{e|9}} atoms of <sup>257</sup>Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. They were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of <sup>257</sup>Fm and in discovery of a new fermium isotope <sup>258</sup>Fm. Also, the rare <sup>250</sup>Cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities, which is very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor <sup>249</sup>Cm \u2013 the half-life of <sup>249</sup>Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very \"long\" on the explosion timescale.<ref name=s47>Seaborg, p. 47</ref>\n\n==Natural occurrence==\nBecause of the short half-life of all isotopes of fermium, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], and is present only within a few months from the time of the synthesis.

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 284.</ref>\n\nChopin was born '''Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin''' in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and grew up in [[Warsaw]], which in 1815 became part of [[Congress Poland]]. A [[child prodigy]], he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with [[Franz Liszt]] and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including [[Robert Schumann]]). In 1835, Chopin obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]] from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, [[George Sand]]). A brief and unhappy visit to [[Majorca]] with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer [[Jane Stirling]], who also arranged for him to visit [[Scotland]] in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two [[piano concerto]]s, a few [[chamber music|chamber pieces]], and some 19 [[Polish songs (Chopin)|songs set to Polish lyrics]]. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ''ballade'']]. His major piano works also include [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise]]s, [[\u00e9tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, [[prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[sonata]]s, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish [[folk music]], the [[classical music|classical tradition]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, [[harmony]], and [[musical form]], and his association of music with [[nationalism]], were influential throughout and after the late [[romanticism|Romantic]] period.\n\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of [[#In literature, stage, film and television|numerous films and biographies]] of varying historical fidelity.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Manor house in \u017belazowa Wola.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Chopin's birthplace in [[\u017belazowa Wola]]]]\nFryderyk Chopin was born in [[\u017belazowa Wola]],<ref name=\"Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 \">Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 (locs. 115\u2013130).</ref> 46 kilometres ({{convert|46|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) west of Warsaw, in what was then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a Polish state established by [[Napoleon]].

Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] as playmate to the son of the ruler of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]]; he played the piano for the Duke and composed a march for him. [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], in his dramatic [[eclogue]], \"''Nasze Przebiegi''\" (\"Our Discourses\", 1818), attested to \"little Chopin's\" popularity.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 11\u201312 (locs. 231\u2013248).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nFrom September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received [[organ (music)|organ]] lessons from the [[Czechs|Czech]] musician [[Wilhelm W\u00fcrfel]] during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course  under the [[Silesia]]n composer [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]] at the [[Fryderyk Chopin University of Music|Warsaw Conservatory]], studying [[music theory]], [[figured bass]]  and [[musical composition|composition]].<ref name=\"Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5.</ref>{{refn|The Conservatory was affiliated with the [[University of Warsaw]]; hence Chopin is counted among the [[University of Warsaw#Notable alumni|university's alumni]].|group=n}} Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the \"eolomelodicon\", and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by [[Ignaz Moscheles|Moscheles]]. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his [[Rondo in C minor (Chopin)|Rondo Op. 1]]. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung|Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' praised his \"wealth of musical ideas\".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 21\u201322 (locs. 365\u2013387).</ref>\n\nDuring 1824\u201328 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locales.{{refn|At [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]] (in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps his first solo travel away from home&nbsp;\u2013 and in 1825), [[Duszniki-Zdr\u00f3j|Duszniki]] (1826), [[Pomerania]] (1827) and [[Sanniki, Masovian Voivodeship|Sanniki]] (1828).<ref>Szklener (2010), p. 8.</ref>|group=n}} In 1824 and 1825, at [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]], he was a guest of [[Dominik Dziewanowski]], the father of a schoolmate.

However, violent unrest triggered by the [[Carbonari]] made that a dangerous destination by the middle of 1831. Chopin's next choice was Paris, but the Russian embassy in Vienna refused to authorize his passport for travel to France. Finally, after numerous delays, he received permission to stop in Paris en route to [[London]]. Chopin neglected to complete the second leg of this journey, instead settling permanently in Paris. In the years to come, he would frequently quote the passport inscription ''Passeport en passant par Paris \u00e0 Londres'' to Parisian friends, joking that he was in the city \"only in passing.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times|last=Walker|first=Alan|publisher=Farrar, Strauss & Giroux|year=2018|isbn=0374159068|location=New York|pages=202}}</ref>\n\nChopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland,<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a71, para. 6.</ref> thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish [[Great Emigration]].

Chopin's biographer [[Adam Zamoyski]] writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 128 (loc. 2027).</ref>\n\nIn Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures, and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, among many others, [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Ferdinand Hiller]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], and [[Alfred de Vigny]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 106 (loc. 1678).</ref> Chopin was also acquainted with the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]], principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 137 (loc. 2164).</ref>\n\nTwo Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Fontana was to become, in the words of Micha\u0142owski and Samson, Chopin's \"general [[servant|factotum]] and copyist\".<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a73, para. 2.</ref>  [[Wojciech Grzyma\u0142a|Albert Grzyma\u0142a]], who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and \"gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life.\"<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;106\u201307 (locs. 1678\u20131696).</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when [[Robert Schumann]], reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' (his first published article on music), declared: \"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\"<ref>Schumann (1988), pp. 15\u201317.</ref> On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the [[Salle Pleyel]] which drew universal admiration. The critic [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis]] wrote in the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale]]'': \"Here is a young man who&nbsp;... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music,&nbsp;... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else&nbsp;...\"<ref>cited in Zamoyski (2010), p. 88 (loc. 1384).</ref> After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private [[salon (gathering)|salons]] (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/> By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, paras. 4\u20135.</ref> This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\n\n[[File:Maria Wodzi\u0144ska.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]], self-portrait]]\nChopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist [[Arthur Hedley]] has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u2014few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\"<ref>Hedley (2005), pp. 263\u201364.</ref> The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)#Concertos for three harpsichords|concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards]]; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil [[Adolphe Gutmann]], [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], and Alkan's teacher [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann|Joseph Zimmermann]] performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th symphony]].<ref>Conway (2012), p. 226 and n. 9.</ref> Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]''; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with [[Maurice Schlesinger]], who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, para. 5. For Schlesinger's international network see Conway (2012), pp. 185\u201387, 238\u201339.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as [[Karl Friedrich Lessing|Lessing]], [[Eduard Bendemann|Bendemann]], [[Eduard Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] and [[Karl Ferdinand Sohn|Sohn]].<ref>Niecks (1980), p. 313.</ref> In 1835 Chopin went to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska|Maria]] in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via [[Leipzig]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;118\u201319 (locs. 1861\u20131878).</ref> The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.<ref name=\"demonstrated\"/> In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, [[Clara Schumann|Clara Wieck]] and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St. Paul]]'', and who considered him \"a perfect musician\".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;119\u201320 (locs. 1878\u20131896).</ref> In July 1836 Chopin travelled to [[Marienbad]] and [[Dresden]] to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his [[Ballades (Chopin)#Ballade No. 1|G minor Ballade]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;126\u201327 (locs. 1983\u20132001).</ref> At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 [[Nocturnes, Op. 27 (Chopin)#Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1|Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1]].<ref>Jachimecki (1937), p. 423.</ref> The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.<ref>Chopin (1962), p. 144.</ref>\n\n===Franz Liszt===\n[[File:Franz Liszt 1839 Litho.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Franz Liszt]] in 1838, engraving by [[Josef Kriehuber]]]]\nAlthough it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]], [[Pierre Baillot|Baillot]], etc.\u2014also [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner|Kalkbrenner]].

The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organized by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife [[Harriet Smithson]], during which they played [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]'s ''Sonata in F minor'' for piano duet.<ref name=\"Hall 32\">Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 32.</ref> Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/> Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the [[Beethoven Monument, Bonn|Beethoven Memorial]] in [[Bonn]], held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nAlthough the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. [[Harold C. Schonberg]] believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\">Schonberg (1987), p. 151.</ref> and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 33.</ref>  Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them  prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\"<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\">Walker (1988), p. 184.</ref> However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress [[Marie d'Agoult]]'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with [[George Sand]].<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\n===George Sand===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chopin at 28, from [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s [[Portrait of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand|joint portrait of Chopin and Sand]] (1838)]]\nIn 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author [[George Sand]] (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Short (under five feet, or 152&nbsp;cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,<ref>Schonberg (1987), p. 152.</ref> she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person ''la Sand'' is.

At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.<ref>Za\u0142uski (1992), pp. 227\u201329.</ref> On 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with [[Marietta Alboni]] and [[Lorenzo Salvi]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/09/from-the-classical-archive-chopin-alboni-review-manchester-1848 \"Review: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and Marietta Alboni perform in Manchester\"], ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 30 August 1848; also singing was Amalia Colbari; the conductor was Charles Seymour, who was later first violinist in [[The Hall\u00e9]] orchestra.

He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of [[Delfina Potocka]], for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in [[Chaillot]], out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by [[Jenny Lind]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 283\u201386 (locs. 4446\u20134487).</ref>\n\n===Death and funeral===\n[[File:Ostatnie chwile Fryderyka Chopina.jpg|thumb|left|''Chopin on His Deathbed'', by [[Teofil Kwiatkowski]], 1849, commissioned by Jane Stirling.

All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either [[piano concerto]]s, songs or [[chamber music]].<ref>Hedley (1980), p. 298.</ref>\n\nChopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], Mozart and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]]; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a76 para 7.</ref> Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of [[Italian opera]]. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his ''[[fioritura|fioriture]]'') is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the [[mode (music)|modes]] and features of the music of his native country, such as [[drone (music)|drones]].<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.). \u00a76, paras 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nChopin took the new salon genre of the [[nocturne]], invented by the Irish composer [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write [[ballade (classical music)|ballades]]<ref name=\"scholesballade\"/> and [[Scherzo|scherzi]] as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.&nbsp;28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert [[\u00e9tude]], already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.&nbsp;10 published in 1833, Op.&nbsp;25 in 1837).<ref>Ferguson (1980), pp. 304\u201305.</ref>\n\nChopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|Chopin's mazurkas]], while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the ''[[mazurka|mazurek]]''), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map.\"<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177.</ref> The series of seven [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op.&nbsp;26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.<ref name=\"chopin13\"/> His [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\">Jones (1998a), p. 162.</ref>\n\n===Titles, opus numbers and editions===\nSome of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the [[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude]] (Op.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;12), and the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' (Op.&nbsp;64,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1). However, with the exception of his ''Funeral March'', the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.<ref>Hedley (2005), p. 264; Kennedy (1980), p. 130, ''Chopin, Fryderyk''.</ref> There is no evidence to suggest that the ''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.<ref>Hedley and Brown (1980), p. 294.</ref> The ''Funeral March'', the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.&nbsp;35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.<ref>Kallberg (2001), pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe last [[opus number]] that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66\u201373), published in 1855.<ref name=\"Piano Society\"/> In 1857, [[Polish songs (Chopin)|17 Polish songs]] that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.<ref name=\"Classical Archives\"/>\n\nWorks published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobyla\u0144ska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist [[Krystyna Kobyla\u0144ska]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/what-does-the-kk-mean/ \"What does the \"KK\" Mean?\"], The Chopin Project Website, accessed 21 December 2013.</ref>\n\nChopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.<ref>Atwood (1999), pp.&nbsp;166\u201367.</ref> His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.<ref>de Val (1998), p. 127.</ref> The first collected edition was by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] (1878\u20131902).<ref>de Val (1998), p. 129.</ref> Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish \"National Edition\", edited by [[Jan Ekier]], both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 306.</ref><ref>Jan Ekier, \"[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 Foundation for the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809202325/http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 |date=9 August 2014 }}\" on the website of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, (accessed 4 August 2014).</ref>\n\nChopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of \u2018first editions\u2019. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/contexts/historical-background/|website=Chopin's First Editions Online|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Form and harmony===\n[[File:Chopin Museum in Warsaw 03.JPG|thumb|Chopin's last ([[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]]) piano, on which he played and composed in 1848\u201349.

Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme\", and adds that \"the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]] Op.&nbsp;60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody.\"<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;161\u201362.</ref> Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes.\"<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|pos=left|filename=Giorgi Latsabidze Plays Mazurka.ogg|title=Mazurka in A minor, Op. 17, No. 4|description=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano|filename2=Muriel-Nguyen-Xuan-Chopin-valse-opus64-1.ogg\n|title2=Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1 (so-called ''Minute Waltz'')|description2=Muriel Nguyen Xuan, piano|filename3=Frederic Chopin - Opus 10 - Twelve Grand Etudes - c minor.ogg|title3 = \u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (so-called ''Revolutionary'')|description3 = [[Martha Goldstein]] playing an 1851 [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard|\u00c9rard]] piano|filename4=Chopin Prelude Op 28 N 15 Giorgi Latsabidze performs.ogg|title4=Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 in D-flat major|description4=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano}}\nChopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward [[ternary form|ternary]] or episodic form, sometimes with a [[coda (music)|coda]].<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177; Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref> The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses.

As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.<ref>Reiss (1980), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe 21 [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]] are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.<ref>Brown (1980), p. 258.</ref>\n\nChopin's \u00e9tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\">Jones (1998a), p. 160.</ref> He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\u2014for instance playing double [[third (chord)|thirds]] ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 6 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;6]]), playing in octaves ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 10 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;10]]), and playing repeated notes ([[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 7 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp; 7]]).<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;160\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\".<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 161.</ref> Inspired by J.S. Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Chopin's preludes move up the [[circle of fifths]] (rather than Bach's [[chromatic scale]] sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 83.</ref> The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as [[Kenneth Hamilton]] suggests: he has noted a recording by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] of 1922, in which the Prelude Op.&nbsp;28 No.&nbsp;7 is followed by the \u00c9tude Op.&nbsp;10 No.&nbsp;5.<ref>Hamilton (2008), pp.&nbsp;101\u201302.</ref>\n\nThe two mature piano sonatas ([[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|No.&nbsp;2]], Op.&nbsp;35, written in 1839 and No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op.&nbsp;35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique\u2014\"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a79 para. 2.</ref> The sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven.

Temperley says that in his works \"novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary [[appoggiatura]]s or [[passing notes]] with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and [[cadence (music)|cadences]] are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ([[neapolitan sixth]]s and [[diminished seventh]]s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. [[Chord progression]]s sometimes anticipate the shifting [[tonality]] of later composers such as [[Claude Debussy]], as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.<ref>Temperley (1980), pp.&nbsp;302\u201303.</ref>\n\n===Technique and performance style===\n[[File:Op 62-1ms.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Extract from Chopin Nocturne Op. 62 no. 1 (1846, composer's manuscript)]]\n[[File:Chopin op 62-1 pr.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The same passage (1881 [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]] edition). The examples show typical use by Chopin of [[trill (music)|trills]], [[grace note]]s and detailed [[pedal (piano)|pedalling]] and [[tempo]] instructions.]]\nIn 1841, [[L\u00e9on Escudier]] wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\"<ref>Samson (1994), p. 136.</ref> Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his ''Projet de m\u00e9thode'' he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering&nbsp;... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 18.</ref> He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 23.</ref> The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double [[octave]]s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of [[grace notes]], and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.<ref>Eigeldinger (1988), pp.&nbsp;18\u201320.</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Bellman]] writes that modern concert performance style\u2014set in the \"[[music school|conservatory]]\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings\u2014militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 149\u201350.</ref> The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 150; the pupil was Emilie von Gretsch.</ref> Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 153\u201354.</ref>  Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery&nbsp;... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe&nbsp;... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\".<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 272.</ref> Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nChopin's music is frequently played with ''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]'', \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".<ref>Latham (n.d.).</ref> There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of ''rubato'' is appropriate for his works. [[Charles Rosen]] comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas&nbsp;... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart&nbsp;... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass&nbsp;... An allied form of this rubato is the [[arpeggio|arpeggiation]] of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil [[Karol Mikuli]], Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 413.</ref>\n\nFriederike M\u00fcller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: \"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full ''[[forte (dynamic)|forte]]'' or softest ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this ''[[legato]]'', ''[[cantabile]]'' style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He\u2014or she\u2014does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced ''rubatos'', as well as exaggerated ''[[Tempo|ritardandos]]''&nbsp;... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\"<ref name=\"nifc14\"/>\n\n===Polish heritage===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin:10px; background:khaki; color:black; width:40em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nThe \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas&nbsp;... which forms&nbsp;... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.&nbsp;... As an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation&nbsp;... For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\"&nbsp;\u2013 an inspired solution to his art&nbsp;\u2013 was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland&nbsp;... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 100%;\" |[[Karol Szymanowski]], 1923<ref>Cited from Szymanowski's 1923 essay, \"Fryderyk Chopin\", in Downes (2001), p. 63 and n. 58.</ref>\n|}With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of [[nationalism]]. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the [[November Uprising]] of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger&nbsp;... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. [[Nicholas I of Russia]]] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\"<ref>Schumann (1988), p. 114.</ref> The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]])<ref>Cooke (1966), pp. 856\u201361.</ref> states that Chopin \"must be ranked first among the first musicians&nbsp;... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation.\"<ref>Liszt (1880), loc. 1503.</ref>\n\nSome modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]] and [[Franciszek Lessel]], who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.<ref>Golos (1960), pp. 439\u201342.</ref> Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.<ref>Milewski (1999), pp. 113\u201321.</ref> [[Richard Taruskin]] impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronizing<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 346; see also Rosen (1995), pp. 361\u201363.</ref>\n\nA reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World&nbsp;... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people&nbsp;...\"<ref>Atwood (1999), p. 57.</ref>\n\n===Reception and influence===\n{{See also|List of memorials to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n[[File:Pillar containing Chopin's heart.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Funerary monument on a pillar in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw]], enclosing Chopin's heart]]\nJones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\"<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\"/> He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831\u2014\"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"\u2014and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\"/> While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of [[romanticism]], the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir\u00e9es) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.<ref name=\"Hutchings 1968, p. 137\"/>\n\nChopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognized by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', and Chopin later dedicated his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2 in F major]] to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\"/> Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.<ref>Conway (2012), pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\nTwo of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821\u20131897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as [[Raoul Koczalski]]) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], \u00c9douard Wolff (1816\u20131880) and Pierre Zimmermann.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 150\u201351.</ref> Debussy dedicated [[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|his own 1915 piano \u00c9tudes]] to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.<ref>Wheeldon (2009), pp. 55, 62.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pomnik Fryderyka Chopina w \u0141azienkach (1 of 1).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Chopin statue, [[\u0141azienki Park]], Warsaw]]\nPolish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as [[Moritz Moszkowski]], but, in the opinion of J.

For most of the German Federal Republic's history, it has held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the [[Bundestag]]. It was a junior coalition partner to the [[CDU/CSU]] (1949\u20131956, 1961\u20131966, 1982\u20131998 and 2009\u20132013) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (1969\u20131982). In the [[German federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], the FDP failed to win any directly elected seats in the [[Bundestag]] and came up short of the 5 percent threshold to qualify for list representation, being left without representation in the Bundestag for the first time in its history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/249651/umfrage/ergebnisse-der-fdp-bei-den-landtagswahlen/|title=Ergebnisse der FDP bei den jeweils letzten Landtagswahlen in den Bundesl\u00e4ndern bis 2017 - Statistik|publisher=}}</ref> In the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 federal election]], the FDP regained its representation in the Bundestag, receiving 10.6% of the vote.\n\nThe FDP strongly supports [[human rights]], [[civil liberties]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. The party is traditionally considered [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]]. Since the 1980s, the party has firmly pushed [[economic liberalism]] and has aligned itself closely to the promotion of [[free market]]s and [[privatization]]. It is a member of [[Liberal International]] and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE).\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union forced the creation of political parties. In July 1945 [[William Kulice]] and [[Eugen Schiffer]] called for the establishment of a [[pan-German]] Party, whose constitution the Allies hesitantly approved only in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] as the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany. In September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]] established the Party of Free Democrats (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] Left Party and the first Liberal Party in the Western zones. In the first state elections in Hamburg in October 1946 the party won 18.2 percent of the vote. The FDP secured between 7.8 and 29.9 percent of the 1946 vote in Greater Berlin (East) and Saxony, the only states in Soviet-occupied territories that held free parliamentary elections. However, it had to support the policies of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) and join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]] of the [[East Germany|GDR]] as a \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\". Following the FDP's success, liberal parties were founded across the states. The FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German Party. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]]. However, the project failed as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's political direction.\n\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 regional liberal party organizations in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.freiheit.org/files/288/1948_Heppenheimer_Proklamation.pdf|title= Heppenheimer Proklamation der Freien Demokratischen Partei|trans-title= Heppenheim Proclamation of the Free Democratic Party|date= 12 December 1948|format= pdf|accessdate= 12 November 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903224113/http://www.freiheit.org/files/288/1948_Heppenheimer_Proklamation.pdf|archivedate= 3 September 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The proposed name, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was rejected by the delegates, who voted 64 to 25 in favour of the name Free Democratic Party (FDP).\n\nThe party's first chairman was Theodor Heuss; his deputy was [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]]. The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. \nSome regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the ''Halber Mond'' (Half Moon) Hotel on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref group=\"Note\">These nine regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation, the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin|Berlin (West)]].

In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[West German presidential election, 1954|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[West German federal election, 1953|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[West German federal election, 1957|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[West German federal election, 1961|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&lpg=PA65&ots=V0g4UTCK6k&dq=%E2%80%9EUmfaller-Partei%E2%80%9C%201961&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9EUmfaller-Partei%E2%80%9C%201961&f=false ''Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren''], Hans-Peter Schwarz, B\u00f6hlau Verlag K\u00f6ln Weimar, 2008, page 66</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[West German federal election, 1965|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU in, Zoglmann later founded the German Union, which does not make it past the status of a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[Nato Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization Young Democrats had founded in 1980 the Young Liberals (JuLis). For a time there were two youth organizations side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the 3rd worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP wasn't able to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Germany)|2009 European parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[German federal election, 2009|national vote on 27 September 2009]] the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far.

This was attributed to the local leadership of [[Christian Lindner]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/world/europe/in-rebuke-to-merkel-social-democrats-win-german-vote.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Kulish | title=Angela Merkel's Party Loses State Election in Germany | date=13 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013 federal election ===\nThe FDP last won a directly elected seat in 1990\u2014the only time it has won a directly elected seat since 1957.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-ACIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=PDS+1994+Germany+directly+elected#v=onepage&q=PDS%201994%20Germany%20directly%20elected&f=false|title=The Left Party in Contemporary German Politics|author1=Dan Hough|author2=Michael Ko\u00df|author3=Jonathan Olsen|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|date=2007|isbn=0230592147}}</ref> The party's inability to win directly elected seats came back to haunt it at the [[German federal election, 2013|2013 election]], in which it came up just short of the 5% threshold. With no directly elected seats, the FDP was shut out of the Bundestag for the first time since 1949. After the previous chairman Philipp R\u00f6sler then resigned, Christian Lindner took over the leadership of the party.\n\n=== 2014 European and state elections ===\nIn the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Germany)|2014 European parliament elections]], the FDP received 3.36% of the national vote (986,253 votes in total) and returned 3 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |title=\u00dcbersicht |work=bundeswahlleiter.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072802/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |archivedate=5 July 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> In the [[Brandenburg state election, 2014]] the party experienced a 5.8% down-swing and lost all their representatives in the Brandenburg state parliament. In the [[Saxony state election, 2014]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[Thuringian state election, 2014]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[Bremen state election, 2015]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, 2016]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[Berlin state election, 2016]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[Rhineland-Palatinate state election, 2016]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[Saxony-Anhalt state election, 2016]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[North Rhine-Westphalia state election, 2017]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[Saarland state election, 2017]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[Schleswig-Holstein state election, 2017]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[German federal election, 2017|federal election of 2017]] the party scored 10,7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:FDP Mitgliederentwicklung.svg|thumb|300px|Membership development showing the spike around 1990 due to East German LDPD and NDPD fusing with the (West German) FDP]]\nThe FDP adheres to a [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideology,<ref name=\"Gunlicks2003\"/><ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Cold War\" /><ref name=\"ImmerfallSobisch1997\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Constitutional Jurisprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |last=Kommers |first=Donald P. |year=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham |isbn=978-0-8223-1838-5 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHZfkgxtoZQC }}</ref> advocating liberalism in both the [[economic policy|economic]] and [[social issues|social sphere]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=European Politics in Transition |last=Kesselman |first=Mark |year=1997 |publisher=D.C.

A key objective of the FDP is the \"strengthening of freedom and individual responsibility\".\n\nThroughout its history, the FDP's policies have shifted between emphasis on [[social liberalism]] and [[economic liberalism]]. Since the 1980s, the FDP has maintained a consistent pro-business stance. The FDP supports strong [[competition law]]s and a minimum standard of welfare protection for every citizen. In addition, the FDP endorses changes to social welfare and [[health care system]]s with laws that would require every employed citizen to invest in a private [[social security]] account. The party supports a bracket [[income tax]] system, as opposed to the current 'linear' system, and, in the long term, a [[flat tax]]. The FDP aims for the introduction of a [[citizen's dividend]], which collects all the tax-financed social welfare and [[social security]] funds of the state.\n\nThe FDP supports [[LGBT rights]] based on support of individual liberty. For instance, former party leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] was openly gay. Yet, when the party joined a coalition with the conservative [[CDU/CSU]], the party's group in parliament voted against an opposition motion legalizing [[same-sex marriage]], in order not to threaten the coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=16809 |title=Homo-Ehe: Bundestag stimmt f\u00fcr Beibehaltung der Diskriminierung |publisher=Queer.de |date= |accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref>\n\nThe FDP describes itself as a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] party and wants a politically integrated EU with a [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], but supported a referendum on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Policies ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nThe basic concept of the FDP is [[liberalism]], which it has traditionally represented in Germany. Its fundamental ideal is therefore in the [[freedom]] of man, especially before state power. The focus of the FDP on the [[Political Compass]] is described as almost unaffected by economic and market liberalism. Regarding the political compass:\n\nThe current FDP guidelines are anchored in the 'Karlsruhe Freiheitsthesen'. These were decided upon at the 63rd Annual Federal Parliamentary Conference on 22 April 2012 in [[Karlsruhe]].\n\n=== Economic policy ===\nThe [[economic policy]] of the FDP is based on [[economic liberalism|liberal]] and [[social market economy|social market economics]]. It calls for a state regulatory policy which creates the appropriate framework for this but does not distort the market through excessive [[state interventionism]]. The main objective is to create jobs by improving the [[investment]] in the economy. This will be achieved through bureaucracy reduction, [[privatization]], [[deregulation]], reduction of [[subsidies]] and reform of the [[collective bargaining]]. \n\nThe party sees [[globalization]] as an opportunity creator.\n\nThe FDP believes [[government debt]] should be reduced and a [[budget balance|balanced budget]] is something to strive for.\n\nIn terms of [[Taxation in Germany|tax policy]], a simpler tax code is called for. Their [[income tax]] model involves a more common system in which tax brackets have constant rates, rather than rates which increase linearly with income. In the long term, a so-called [[flat tax]] is strived for. Tax cuts are designed to increase the purchasing power of workers and stimulate the economy.\n\nThe FDP rejects the nationwide [[Minimum wage law#Germany|minimum wage]], which was only introduced to Germany in 2015. On the other hand, wage ceilings are to be introduced which depend on the specific characteristics of respective regions and industries.\n\n=== Social policy ===\nIn [[social policy]], the introduction of a consolidated welfare payments in which all tax-financed social aid of the state is combined. This is a based of [[negative income tax]]. It would have a work obligation like those found in present regulation.\n\nA common denominator of the FDP is the critical attitude toward an overpowering of the [[State (polity)|state]] and to [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] corporate designs. According to the motto \"As much state as necessary, as little state as possible\", the FDP tries to limit the interference of the state with the life of the individual as far as possible, therefore it also rejects all elements of a [[monitoring country]]. A connecting element is the idea of \"creating and safeguarding the freedom of the individual\", thus it contributed almost all social liberalisations realized in the [[History of the Federal Republic of Germany (to 1990)|Federal Republic]].\n\n=== Health policy ===\nIn the field of [[health policy]], the FDP argues for a reduction of bureaucratic regulations. Also the physical [[self-determination]] is particularly emphasized. For example, each human being should also have the right in the context of [[medical treatment]] to freely determine his [[Human body|biology]]. In addition, the FDP aims to legalize [[cannabis]].\n\n=== Family policy ===\nThe FDP is committed to the [[legal equality]] of different forms of living together. Marriage between husband and wife should not be preferred to other forms of living together. Same-sex couples are to be given the same rights as heterosexual pairs &mdash; for example, the common right of adoption. The [[Same-sex marriage|opening of marriage]] for same-sex couples is demanded. The income splitting should be retained. The expansion of [[kindergarten]] places is to be strengthened nationwide.\n\n== Election results ==\n=== Federal Parliament (''Bundestag'') ===\nBelow are charts of the results that the FDP has secured in each election to the federal [[Bundestag]].

short for '''telefacsimile'''), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a '''fax machine''' (or a '''telecopier'''), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a [[bitmap]], and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/fax|title=What is fax?|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|date=June 2006 |publisher=SearchNetworking |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Wire transmission ===\nScottish inventor [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments.  He received British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843 for his \"Electric Printing Telegraph\".<ref>\u201cMr. Bain\u2019s Electric Printing Telegraph,\u201d Mechanics' Magazine April 13, 1844, 268\u201370</ref>\n\n[[Frederick Bakewell]] made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. The [[Pantelegraph]] was invented by the Italian physicist [[Giovanni Caselli]].  He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon in 1865, some 11 years before the invention of the [[telephone]].<ref name=\"italianunivbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itisgalileiroma.it/shed/shed0/shed0/caselli.htm |title=Istituto Tecnico Industriale,  Italy.

Around 1900, German physicist [[Arthur Korn]] invented the ''[[:de:Bildtelegrafie|Bildtelegraph]]'', widespread in continental Europe especially, since a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908, used until the wider distribution of the radiofax. Its main competitors were the ''B\u00e9linographe'' by [[\u00c9douard Belin]] first, then since the 1930s the ''[[Hellschreiber]]'', invented in 1929 by German inventor [[Rudolf Hell]], a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission.{{fact|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe 1888 invention of the [[telautograph]] by [[Elisha Gray]] marked a further development in fax technology, allowing users to send signatures over long distances, thus allowing the verification of identification or ownership over long distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faxauthority.com/fax-history/|title=The History of Fax \u2013 from 1843 to Present Day|publisher=Fax Authority|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn May 19, 1924, scientists of the AT&T Corporation \"by a new process of transmitting pictures by electricity\" sent 15 photographs by telephone from Cleveland to New York City, such photos being suitable for newspaper reproduction. Previously, photographs had been sent over the radio using this process.<ref>The Montreal Gazette, May 20, 1924, page 10, column 3</ref>\n\nThe Western Union \"Deskfax\" fax machine, announced in 1948, was a compact machine that fit comfortably on a desktop, using special [[spark printer]] paper.<ref name=Ridings1949>G.

Ranger]] invented the wireless photoradiogram, or transoceanic [[radiofax|radio facsimile]], the forerunner of today\u2019s \"fax\" machines. A photograph of President [[Calvin Coolidge]] sent from New York to London on November 29, 1924, became the first photo picture reproduced by transoceanic radio facsimile. Commercial use of Ranger\u2019s product began two years later. Also in 1924, [[Herbert E. Ives]] of [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] transmitted and reconstructed the first color facsimile, a natural-color photograph of silent film star [[Rudolph Valentino]] in period costume, using red, green and blue color separations.<ref name=\"Sipley\">Sipley, Louis Walton (1951). ''A Half Century of Color''. Macmillan.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late 1930s, the Finch Facsimile system was used to transmit a \"radio newspaper\" to private homes via commercial AM radio stations and ordinary radio receivers equipped with Finch's printer, which used thermal paper. Sensing a new and potentially golden opportunity, competitors soon entered the field, but the printer and special paper were expensive luxuries, AM radio transmission was very slow and vulnerable to static, and the newspaper was too small. After more than ten years of repeated attempts by Finch and others to establish such a service as a viable business, the public, apparently quite content with its cheaper and much more substantial home-delivered daily newspapers, and with conventional spoken radio bulletins to provide any \"hot\" news, still showed only a passing curiosity about the new medium.<ref name=\"Schneider\">Schneider, John (2011).

Also, it is also widely used within the medical field to transmit confidential patient information. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n{{tone|date=May 2013}}\n\n=== Telephone transmission ===\nIn 1964, Xerox Corporation introduced (and patented) what many consider to be the first commercialized version of the modern fax machine, under the name (LDX) or Long Distance Xerography.  This model was superseded two years later with a unit that would truly set the standard for fax machines for years to come.  Up until this point facsimile machines were very expensive and hard to operate. In 1966, Xerox released the Magnafax Telecopiers, a smaller, 46-pound facsimile machine.  This unit was far easier to operate and could be connected to any standard telephone line.  This machine was capable of transmitting a letter-sized document in about six minutes. The first sub-minute, digital fax machine was developed by [[Dacom]], which built on digital data compression technology originally developed at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] for satellite communication.<ref name=\"etd.ohiolink.edu\">[https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/ohiou1183661772/inline ''The implementation of a personal computer-based digital facsimile information distribution system''] \u2013 Edward C.

Costigan, Chilton Book Company, 1971, pages 112\u2013114, 213, 239</ref>\n\nBy the late 1970s, many companies around the world (especially Japanese firms) had entered the fax market.  Very shortly after this, a new wave of more compact, faster and efficient fax machines would hit the market.   Xerox continued to refine the fax machine for years after their ground-breaking first machine. In later years it would be combined with copier equipment to create the hybrid machines we have today that copy, scan and fax.  Some of the lesser known capabilities of the Xerox fax technologies included their Ethernet enabled Fax Services on their 8000 workstations in the early 1980s.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the ubiquitous fax machine, one of the first being the [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] Qwip<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/business/an-exxon-sale-to-harris-unit-the-exxon-corporation-said.html An Exxon Sale To Harris Unit] \u2013 [[The New York Times]], February 22, 1985.</ref> in the mid-1970s, facsimile machines worked by optical scanning of a document or drawing spinning on a drum. The reflected light, varying in intensity according to the light and dark areas of the document, was focused on a [[photocell]] so that the current in a circuit varied with the amount of light. This current was used to control a tone generator (a [[modulator]]), the current determining the frequency of the tone produced. This audio tone was then transmitted using an [[acoustic coupler]] (a speaker, in this case) attached to the microphone of a common [[Handset|telephone handset]]. At the receiving end, a handset\u2019s speaker was attached to an acoustic coupler (a microphone), and a [[fax demodulator|demodulator]] converted the varying tone into a variable current that controlled the mechanical movement of a pen or pencil to reproduce the image on a blank sheet of paper on an identical drum rotating at the same rate.\n\n=== Computer facsimile interface ===\nIn 1985, [[Hank Magnuski]], founder of [[GammaLink]], produced the first computer fax board, called [[GammaFax]].

Such systems have the advantage of reducing costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound analog phone lines needed by an office.\n\nThe once ubiquitous fax machine has also begun to disappear from the small office and home office environments. Remotely hosted fax-server services are widely available from VoIP and e-mail providers allowing users to send and receive faxes using their existing e-mail accounts without the need for any hardware or dedicated fax lines. Personal computers have also long been able to handle incoming and outgoing faxes using analog modems or [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], eliminating the need for a stand-alone fax machine. These solutions are often ideally suited for users who only very occasionally need to use fax services.  In July 2017 the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]] was said to be the world's largest purchaser of fax machines because the digital revolution has largely bypassed it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Digital doldrums: NHS remains world\u2019s largest purchaser of fax machines|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/digital-doldrums-nhs-remains-worlds-largest-purchaser-of-fax-machines|accessdate=1 March 2018|publisher=National Health Executive|date=5 July 2017}}</ref>  In June 2018 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] claimed that the NHS had at least 11,620 fax machines in operation.<ref>{{cite news |title=NHS 'Struggling To Keep Up' As It Holds On To Thousands Of Fax Machines |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nhs-fax-machines-labour_uk_5b1e5f83e4b09d7a3d7508e7 |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=Huffington Post |date=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Capabilities ==\nThere are several indicators of fax capabilities: group, class, data transmission rate, and conformance with [[ITU-T]] (formerly [[CCITT]]) recommendations. Since the 1968 [[Carterphone decision]], most fax machines have been designed to connect to standard [[PSTN]] lines and telephone numbers.\n\n=== Group ===\n\n==== Analog ====\nGroup 1 and 2 faxes are sent in the same manner as a frame of [[analog television]], with each scanned line transmitted as a continuous analog signal. Horizontal resolution depended upon the quality of the scanner, transmission line, and the printer. Analog fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured.  ITU-T Recommendations T.2 and T.3 were withdrawn as obsolete in July 1996.\n\n* Group 1 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendation T.2. Group 1 faxes take six minutes to transmit a single page, with a vertical resolution of 96 [[scan line]]s per inch. Group 1 fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured.\n* Group 2 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.3 and T.30. Group 2 faxes take three minutes to transmit a single page, with a vertical resolution of 96 scan lines per inch. Group 2 fax machines are almost obsolete, and are no longer manufactured.  Group 2 fax machines can interoperate with Group 3 fax machines.\n\n==== Digital ====\n[[File:Dacom DFC-10.jpg|thumb|300 px|The Dacom DFC-10\u2014the first digital fax machine.<ref name=\"etd.ohiolink.edu\"/>]]\n[[File:Faxchip.jpg|thumb|300 px|The chip in a fax machine.

The first digital fax machine was the [[Dacom]] Rapidfax first sold in late 1960s, which incorporated digital data compression technology developed by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] for transmission of images from satellites.<ref name=\"etd.ohiolink.edu\"/><ref name=\"Fax 1971, Pages 112-114\"/>\n\nGroup 3 and 4 faxes are digital formats, and take advantage of digital compression methods to greatly reduce transmission times.\n\n* Group 3 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.30 and T.4. Group 3 faxes take between six and fifteen seconds to transmit a single page (not including the initial time for the fax machines to handshake and synchronize). The horizontal and vertical resolutions are allowed by the T.4 standard to vary among a set of fixed resolutions:\n** Horizontal: 100 scan lines per inch\n*** Vertical: 100 scan lines per inch (\"Basic\")\n** Horizontal: 200 or 204 scan lines per inch\n*** Vertical: 100 or 98 scan lines per inch (\"Standard\")\n*** Vertical: 200 or 196 scan lines per inch (\"Fine\")\n*** Vertical: 400 or 391 (note not 392) scan lines per inch (\"Superfine\")\n** Horizontal: 300 scan lines per inch\n*** Vertical: 300 scan lines per inch\n** Horizontal: 400 or 408 scan lines per inch\n*** Vertical: 400 or 391 scan lines per inch (\"Ultrafine\")\n* Group 4 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.563, T.503, T.521, T.6, T.62, T.70, T.411 to T.417. They are designed to operate over 64 kbit/s digital [[ISDN]] circuits. The allowed resolutions, a superset of those in the T.4 recommendation, are specified in the T.6 recommendation.<ref name=\"T6\"/>\n\nFax Over IP ([[FoIP]]) can transmit and receive pre-digitized documents at near realtime speeds using [[T.38 ITU-T recommendation|ITU-T recommendation T.38]] to send digitised images over an [[IP network]] using [[JPEG]] compression. T.38 is designed to work with [[VoIP]] services and often supported by [[analog telephone adapter]]s used by legacy fax machines that need to connect through a VoIP service. Scanned documents are limited to the amount of time the user takes to load the document in a scanner and for the device to process a digital file. The resolution can vary from as little as 150 DPI to 9600 DPI or more. This type of faxing is not related to the e-mail to fax service that still uses fax modems at least one way.\n\n=== Class ===\nComputer modems are often designated by a particular fax class, which indicates how much processing is offloaded from the computer's CPU to the fax modem.\n\n* Class 1 fax devices do fax data transfer where the T.4/T.6 data compression and T.30 session management are performed by software on a controlling computer. This is described in ITU-T recommendation T.31.<ref name=peterson2000>{{cite book| first=Kerstin Day | last=Peterson | year=2000| title=Business telecom systems: a guide to choosing the best technologies and services| pages=191\u2013192| publisher=Focal Press| isbn=1578200415| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W79R0niNU5wC&pg=PA191| accessdate=2011-04-02 }}</ref>\n* Class 2 fax devices perform T.30 session management themselves, but the T.4/T.6 data compression is performed by software on a controlling computer. The relevant ITU-T recommendation is T.32.<ref name=peterson2000/>\n* Class 2.0 is different from Class 2.\n* Class 2.1 is an improvement of Class 2.0.  Class 2.1 fax devices are referred to as \"super G3\"; they seem to be a little faster than Class 1/2/2.0.\n* Class 3 fax devices are responsible for virtually the entire fax session, given little more than a phone number and the text to send (including rendering ASCII text as a raster image). These devices are not common.\n\n=== Data transmission rate ===\nSeveral different telephone line modulation techniques are used by fax machines. They are negotiated during the fax-[[modem]] [[handshaking|handshake]], and the fax devices will use the highest data rate that both fax devices support, usually a minimum of 14.4 kbit/s for Group 3 fax.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!ITU Standard\n!Released Date\n!Data Rates (bit/s)\n!Modulation Method\n|-\n|[[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.27]]\n|1988\n|4800, 2400\n|[[phase-shift keying|PSK]]\n|-\n|[[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.29]]\n|1988\n|9600, 7200, 4800\n|[[quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|-\n|[[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.17]]\n|1991\n|14,400; 12,000; 9600; 7200\n|[[trellis modulation|TCM]]\n|-\n|[[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.34]]\n|1994\n|28,800\n|[[quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|-\n|[[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.34bis]]\n|1998\n|33,600\n|[[quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|-\n|[[ISDN]]\n|1986\n|64,000\n|digital\n|}\n\nNote that \"Super Group 3\" faxes use V.34bis modulation that allows a data rate of up to 33.6 kbit/s.\n\n=== Compression ===\nAs well as specifying the resolution (and allowable physical size of the image being faxed), the ITU-T T.4 recommendation specifies two compression methods for decreasing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between the fax machines to transfer the image. The two methods defined in T.4 are:<ref name=\"T4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.4/en|title=T.4: Standardization of Group 3 facsimile terminals for document transmission|publisher=ITU-T|date=2011-03-14|accessdate=2013-12-28}}</ref>\n*[[Modified Huffman coding|Modified Huffman]] (MH), and\n*[[Modified READ]] (MR) (''Relative Element Address Designate''<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456020&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5%2F31291%2F01456020.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1456020 ''International digital facsimile coding standards],'' Hunter, R., and Robinson, A.H., Proceedings of the IEEE Volume 68 Issue 7, pp 854\u2013867, July 1980</ref>), optional\nAn additional method is specified in T.6:<ref name=\"T6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.6/en|title=T.6: Facsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for Group 4 facsimile apparatus|publisher=ITU-T|date=November 1988|accessdate=2013-12-28}}</ref>\n*[[Group 4 compression|Modified Modified READ]] (MMR)\nLater, other compression techniques were added as options to ITU-T recommendation T.30, such as the more efficient [[JBIG]] (T.82, T.85) for bi-level content, and [[JPEG]] (T.81), T.43, [[Mixed raster content|MRC]] (T.44), and T.45 for grayscale, palette, and colour content.<ref name=\"T30\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.30|title=T.30: Procedures for document facsimile transmission in the general switched telephone network|publisher=ITU-T|date=2014-05-15|accessdate=2013-12-28}}</ref> Fax machines can negotiate at the start of the T.30 session to use the best technique implemented on both sides.\n\n==== Modified Huffman ====\n{{Main|Modified Huffman coding}}\nModified Huffman (MH), specified in T.4 as the one-dimensional coding scheme, is a codebook-based run-length encoding scheme optimised to efficiently compress whitespace.<ref name=\"T4\"/> As most faxes consist mostly of white space, this minimises the transmission time of most faxes. Each line scanned is compressed independently of its predecessor and successor.<ref name=\"T4\"/>\n\n==== Modified READ ====\nModified READ (MR), specified as an optional two-dimensional coding scheme in T.4, encodes the first scanned line using MH.<ref name=\"T4\"/> The next line is compared to the first, the differences determined, and then the differences are encoded and transmitted.<ref name=\"T4\"/>  This is effective as most lines differ little from their predecessor.  This is not continued to the end of the fax transmission, but only for a limited number of lines until the process is reset and a new 'first line' encoded with MH is produced.  This limited number of lines is to prevent errors propagating throughout the whole fax, as the standard does not provide for error-correction.  MR is an optional facility, and some fax machines do not use MR in order to minimise the amount of computation required by the machine. The limited number of lines is two for 'Standard' resolution faxes, and four for 'Fine' resolution faxes.\n\n==== Modified Modified READ ====\n{{Main|Group 4 compression}}\nThe ITU-T T.6 recommendation adds a further compression type of Modified Modified READ (MMR), which simply allows for a greater number of lines to be coded by MR than in T.4.<ref name=\"T6\"/>  This is because T.6 makes the assumption that the transmission is over a circuit with a low number of line errors such as digital [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]]. In this case, there is no maximum number of lines for which the differences are encoded.\n\n==== JBIG ====\n\nIn 1999, ITU-T recommendation T.30 added [[JBIG]] (ITU-T T.82) as another [[lossless]] [[Binary image|bi-level]] compression algorithm, or more precisely a \"fax profile\" subset of JBIG (ITU-T T.85). JBIG-compressed pages result in 20% to 50% faster transmission than MMR-compressed pages, and up to 30-times faster transmission if the page includes [[halftone]] images.\n\n[[JBIG]] performs [[adaptive compression]], that is both the encoder and decoder collect statistical information about the transmitted image from the pixels transmitted so far, in order to predict the probability for each next pixel being either black or white. For each new pixel, JBIG looks at ten nearby, previously transmitted pixels. It counts, how often in the past the next pixel has been black or white in the same neighborhood, and estimates from that the probability distribution of the next pixel. This is fed into an [[arithmetic coder]], which adds only a small fraction of a bit to the output sequence if the more probable pixel is then encountered.\n\nThe ITU-T T.85 \"fax profile\" constrains some optional features of the full JBIG standard, such that codecs do not have to keep data about more than the last three pixel rows of an image in memory at any time. This allows the streaming of \"endless\" images, where the height of the image may not be known until the last row is transmitted.\n\nITU-T T.30 allows fax machines to negotiate one of two options of the T.85 \"fax profile\":\n* In \"basic mode\", the JBIG encoder must split the image into horizontal stripes of 128 lines (parameter L0=128), and restart the arithmetic encoder for each stripe.\n* In \"option mode\", there is no such constraint.\n\n==== Matsushita Whiteline Skip ====\nA proprietary compression scheme employed on Panasonic fax machines is Matsushita Whiteline Skip (MWS). It can be overlaid on the other compression schemes, but is operative only when two Panasonic machines are communicating with one another. This system detects the blank scanned areas between lines of text, and then compresses several blank scan lines into the data space of a single character. (JBIG implements a similar technique called \"typical prediction\", if header flag TPBON is set to 1.)\n\n=== Typical characteristics ===\nGroup 3 fax machines transfer one or a few printed or handwritten pages per minute in black-and-white (bitonal) at a [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of 204\u00d798 (normal) or 204\u00d7196 (fine) dots per square inch. The transfer rate is 14.4&nbsp;kbit/s or higher for modems and some fax machines, but fax machines support speeds beginning with 2400 bit/s and typically operate at 9600 bit/s. The transferred image formats are called [[ITU-T]] (formerly CCITT) fax group 3 or 4. Group 3 faxes have the [[Filename extension|suffix]] <code>.g3</code> and the [[MIME type]] <tt>image/g3fax</tt>.\n\nThe most basic fax mode transfers in black and white only. The original page is scanned in a resolution of 1728 [[pixel]]s/line and 1145 lines/page (for [[A4 paper size|A4]]). The resulting raw data is [[data compression|compressed]] using a modified [[Huffman coding|Huffman code]] optimized for written text, achieving average compression factors of around 20. Typically a page needs 10&nbsp;s for transmission, instead of about 3 minutes for the same uncompressed raw data of 1728\u00d71145 bits at a speed of 9600&nbsp;bit/s. The compression method uses a Huffman codebook for run lengths of black and white runs in a single scanned line, and it can also use the fact that two adjacent scanlines are usually quite similar, saving bandwidth by encoding only the differences.\n\nFax classes denote the way fax programs interact with fax hardware. Available classes include Class 1, Class 2, Class 2.0 and 2.1, and Intel CAS. Many modems support at least class 1 and often either Class 2 or Class 2.0. Which is preferable to use depends on factors such as hardware, software, modem firmware, and expected use.\n\n===Printing process===\nFax machines from the 1970s to the 1990s often used direct [[thermal printer]]s with rolls of thermal paper as their printing technology, but since the mid-1990s there has been a transition towards plain-paper faxes: [[thermal transfer printer]]s, [[inkjet printer]]s and [[Laser printing|laser printers]].\n\nOne of the advantages of inkjet printing is that inkjets can affordably print in [[color]]; therefore, many of the inkjet-based fax machines claim to have color fax capability. There is a standard called ITU-T30e (formally ITU-T Recommendation T.30 Annex E <ref>{{cite web|author=tsbmail |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.30-200509-I/en |title=T.30 : Procedures for document facsimile transmission in the general switched telephone network |publisher=Itu.int |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref>) for faxing in color; however, it is not widely supported, so many of the color fax machines can only fax in color to machines from the same manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Stroke speed ===\nStroke speed in facsimile systems is the rate at which a fixed line perpendicular to the direction of [[Image scanning|scanning]] is crossed in one direction by a scanning or [[recording spot]]. Stroke speed is usually expressed as a number of strokes per minute. When the fax system scans in both directions, the stroke speed is twice this number. In most conventional 20th century mechanical systems, the stroke speed is equivalent to drum speed.<ref>{{FS1037C MS188}}</ref>\n\n=== Fax paper ===\n[[File:ThermalPaperG3-TMG.JPG|thumb|[[Thermal paper|Paper]] roll for [[thermal printing|direct thermal]] fax machine]]\nAs a precaution, thermal fax paper is typically not accepted in archives or as documentary evidence in some courts of law unless photocopied. This is because the image-forming coating is eradicable and brittle, and it tends to detach from the medium after a long time in storage.<ref>\"4.12 Filing rules: 19.Newspaper extracts or thermal facsimile paper should not be preserved as archives. Such extracts should be photocopied and the copy preserved. The original can then be destroyed.\" Office of Corporate & Legal Affairs, University College Cork, Ireland</ref>\n\n== Internet fax ==\n{{see also|Internet fax}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nOne popular alternative is to subscribe to an [[Internet fax]] service, allowing users to send and receive faxes from their [[personal computer]]s using an existing [[email account]]. No software, fax server or fax machine is needed. Faxes are received as attached [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] or [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files, or in proprietary formats that require the use of the service provider's software. Faxes can be sent or retrieved from anywhere at any time that a user can get Internet access. Some services offer secure faxing to comply with stringent [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]] requirements to keep medical information and financial information private and secure. Utilizing a fax service provider does not require paper, a dedicated fax line, or consumable resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.efax.com/blog/online-fax-2/five-reasons-to-adopt-online-fax|title=Online Fax vs Traditional Fax|date=16 May 2013|publisher=eFax|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother alternative to a physical fax machine is to make use of computer [[software]] which allows people to send and receive faxes using their own computers, utilizing [[fax server]]s and [[unified messaging]]. A virtual (email) fax can be printed out and then signed and scanned back to computer before being emailed. Also the sender can attach a digital signature to the document file.\n\nWith the surging popularity of mobile phones, virtual fax machines can now be downloaded as applications for Android and iOS. These applications make use of the phone's internal camera to scan fax documents for upload or they can import from various cloud services.\n\n==Related Standards==\n* [[T.4]] is the umbrella specification for fax.  It specifies the standard image sizes, two forms of image-data compression (encoding), the image-data format, and references, T.30 and the various modem standards.\n* [[T.6]] specifies a compression scheme that reduces the time required to transmit an image by roughly 50-percent.\n* [[T.30 (ITU-T recommendation)|T.30]] specifies the procedures that a sending and receiving terminal use to set up a fax call, determine the image size, encoding, and transfer speed, the demarcation between pages, and the termination of the call.  T.30 also references the various modem standards.\n* [[ITU V.21|V.21]], [[V.27ter]], [[V.29 (recommendation)|V.29]], [[V.17 ITU recommendation|V.17]], [[V.34 (recommendation)|V.34]]: ITU modem standards used in facsimile.  The first three were ratified prior to 1980, and were specified in the original T.4 and T.30 standards.

The ''[[crew]]'' is distinguished from the ''cast'' as the ''cast'' are understood to be the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film. The ''crew'' is also separate from the ''producers'' as the ''producers'' are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the film's [[intellectual property rights]]. A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and film-making cultures.\n\nMotion picture projects have three discrete stages: development, production and distribution. Within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases \u2014 pre-production, principal photography and post-production \u2014 and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases. Distinctions are also made between [[Above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] personnel (such as the director, the screenwriter and the producers) who begin their involvement during the project's development stage, and the [[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]] \"technical\" crew involved only with the production stage.\n\n== Director ==\n\n== Production ==\n\n''Production'' is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the film's producers and executive producers and production office staff such as the production manager, the production coordinator, and their assistants; the various assistant directors; the accounting staff and sometimes the locations manager and their assistants.\n\n'''[[Film producer|Producer]]'''\n:A film producer creates the conditions for film-making. The producer initiates, coordinates, supervises, and controls matters such as fund raising, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors. The producer is involved throughout all phases of the film making process from development to completion of a project. There may be several producers on a film who may take a role in a number of areas, such as development, financing or production.<ref>{{cite web |title = Producers Guild Awards |url = https://socialbilitty.com/2014/03/producers-guild-awards/ |date = March 16, 2014 |publisher = ''[[Socialbilitty]]'' |access-date = January 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n'''Executive producer'''\n:An executive producer (EP) is a producer who was not involved in the technical aspects of the film-making process in the original definition, but has played a financial or creative role in ensuring that the project goes into production.[1] Today, however, the title has become ambiguous,[2] particularly in feature films. Since the 1980s, it has become increasingly common for the line producer to be given the title of executive producer, while the initiating producer takes the \"produced by\" credit. On other projects, the reverse happens, with the line producer taking the \"produced by\" credit. So the two credits have become effectively interchangeable, with no precise definition.\n\n=== Production office ===\n\n=== Locations ===\n\n; [[Location manager]]\n: Oversees the midget department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the production manager or assistant director (or even director or executive producer). Location manager is responsible for final clearing (or guaranteeing permission to use) a location for filming and must often assist production and finance departments in maintaining budget management regarding actual location/permit fees as well as labor costs to production for himself and the locations department at large.\n; Assistant location manager\n: Works with the location manager and the various departments in arranging technical scouts for the essential staff (grips, electric, camera, etc.) to see options which the location manager has selected for filming. The assistant location manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the location manager continues pre-production from elsewhere (generally an office) on the upcoming locations. (Note: On most location-based television shows, there will be two assistant location managers that alternate episodes, allowing one to prep an upcoming episode while the other is on-set with the current one.)\n; [[Location scout]]\n: Does much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the location manager will do some scouting herself or himself, as well as the assistant location manager.\n; Location assistant\n: Hired by the location manager to be on-set before, during, and after the filming process. General responsibilities include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming; fielding complaints from neighbours; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, making sure it seems as though the film crew was never there. There is generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.\n; Location production assistant\n: This position exists generally on larger budget productions. The locations PA is the assistant who is almost never on-set, but instead is always prepping a location or \"wrapping\" a location; that is, when a location requires several days of setup and breakdown preceding and following the day(s) of filming. A location production assistant is what a set production assistant is in Canada.\n\n=== Additional production credits ===\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, several additional professionals are now routinely listed in the production credits on most major motion pictures.\n;'''[[Publicist|Unit publicist]]'''\n: The publicist liaises between the film production and the media. They create press releases, in collaboration with the producers, and work with the [[unit still photographer]].\n;'''[[Lawyer|Legal counsel]]'''\n: Entertainment lawyers negotiate contracts, clear licensing rights for any intellectual property used in the film, obtain tax credits from local governments, and take care of immigration paperwork when cast or crew cross international borders to shoot on location.\n; [[System administrator]]\n: A system administrator or sysadmin, is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network. This role is increasingly important for digital monitors on set, digital intermediate editing and post production, digital effects, digital sound, and sometimes for full digital production.\n\n=== Continuity ===\n\n; [[Script supervisor]]\n: Also known as the ''continuity person'', the script supervisor keeps track of what parts of the script have been filmed and makes notes of any deviations between what was actually filmed and what appeared in the script. They make notes on every shot, and keep track of props, blocking, and other details to ensure continuity between shots and scenes. An important part of a script supervisor's job is to make sure that actors' movements, the directions they are looking in a shot, particularly when speaking to or responding to another actor, plus the positions of props they are using and every thing else matches from shot to shot. If there is an apparent mismatch, the director must be informed immediately so that it can be reshot before the lighting setup is changed or at least before the location is wrapped and the set is struck. Not only does the job of script supervisor require a great deal of awareness and meticulous note-taking skills, it also requires much diplomacy to advise the director that they may have a problem editing something just recorded. The script supervisor is also in charge of providing the \"official\" scene numbers and take numbers to the second camera assistant (clapper loader in some countries) for the slate, as well as to the sound mixer, and to clearly note which take the director has chosen to be used (as a \"print,\" in film terms) in the finished product. All of this information is then relayed to the editor every day after shooting has wrapped in the form of copies made of both the script supervisor's notes as well as their matching script pages.\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n; [[Casting director]]\n:The casting director chooses the actors for the characters of the film. This usually involves inviting potential actors to read an excerpt from the script for an audition.\n; Cast PA\n:The cast PA assists the actors  of the film. This usually involves personal and technical requests, that might be highly sensible and private or common domain or knowledge.\n\n== Camera and lighting ==\n\n[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|A [[Camera operator]] filming a scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]]]]\n\n[[File:FilmCrew.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|The production was for the TV movie Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking at Somerset House in London.]]\n\n; [[Director of photography]]\n: The director of photography, DoP or DP, is in charge of the look of the \"frame\" of the movie shots, hence the name \"photography\". He is the chief of the camera and lighting crew of the film. The DoP makes decisions on lighting and framing of shots in conjunction with the film's director. Typically, the director tells the DoP how they want a shot to look, and the DoP chooses the correct lens, filter, lighting and composition to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. The DoP is the senior creative crew member after the director.\n: The term ''[[Cinematographer]]'' is usually synonymous with ''director of photography'', though some professionals insist this only applies when the director of photography and camera operator are the same person.\n\n=== Camera ===\n\n; [[Camera operator]]\n: The camera operator uses the camera at the direction of the cinematographer, director of photography, or the film director to capture the scenes on film or video. Generally, a cinematographer or director of photography does not operate the camera, but sometimes these jobs may be combined.\n; [[First assistant camera]]\n: The first assistant camera, 1st AC or ''' focus puller''', is responsible for keeping the camera in focus as it is shooting, as well as building the camera at the beginning of the day and taking it apart at the end. They also thread the film when a new magazine is loaded.\n; [[Second assistant camera]]\n: The second assistant camera, 2nd AC or '''[[Clapper loader]]''', operates the [[clapperboard]] commonly referred to in the United States as a \"Slate\" at the beginning of each take and loads the raw [[film stock]] or blank videocassette into the camera magazines between takes, if there is no additional specifically designated film loader. The 2nd AC is also in charge of overseeing the meticulously kept notebooks that record when the film stock is received, used, and sent to the lab for processing. Additionally, the 2nd AC oversees organization of camera equipment and transport of the equipment from one shooting location to another.\n; Film loader\n: The loader transfers motion picture film from the manufacturer's light-tight canisters to the camera magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places it back into the light-tight cans for transport to the laboratory. It is the responsibility of the loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.\n; Camera production assistant\n: The camera PA, ''' camera intern''' or ''' camera trainee''', assists the crew while learning the trade of the camera assistant, operator or cinematographer.\n; [[Digital imaging technician]]\n: On digital photography productions the digital imaging technician, or DIT, is responsible for the coordination of the internal workings of the digital camera. Under the direction of the cinematographer or director of photography, the DIT will make adjustments to the multitude of variables available in most professional digital cameras to creatively or technically manipulate the resulting image. It may also be the responsibility of the DIT to archive and manage the digital data, create compressed dailies from raw footage and prepare all digital images for post-production.\n; Steadicam operator\n: A steadicam operator is someone who is skilled at operating a [[Steadicam]] (trademark for a camera stabilization rig). This person is usually one of the camera operators on the production.\n; Motion control technician/Operator\n: This technician operates a [[Motion control photography|motion control rig]], which essentially is a 'camera robot' able to consistently repeat camera moves for special effects uses. Motion control rigs are typically rented with an experienced operator.\n\n=== Lighting ===\n\n; [[Gaffer (motion picture industry)|Gaffer]]\n: The gaffer is the head of the lighting department, responsible for the design of the lighting plan for a production. Sometimes the gaffer is credited as ''' chief lighting technician'''.\n; [[Best boy]] (lighting)\n: The best boy is the chief assistant to the gaffer. They are not usually on set, but dealing with the electric truck, rentals, manpower, and other logistics.\n; [[Lighting technician]] / Electrics\n: Also called Electrics or Lamp Operators, Lighting technicians are involved with setting up and controlling lighting equipment and temporary power distribution on set.\n\n=== Grip ===\n\n[[Grip (job)|Grips]] are trained lighting and rigging technicians. Their main responsibility is to work closely with the electrical department to put in the non-electrical components of lighting set-ups required for a shot, such as flags, overheads, and bounces. On the [[sound stage]], they move and adjust major set pieces when something needs to be moved to get a camera into position. In the US and Canada they may belong to the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]].\n\n; [[Key grip]]\n: The key grip is the chief grip on a set, and is the head of the set operations department. The key grip works with the director of photography to help set up the set and to achieve correct lighting and [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]]. They are also used to  Manoeuver the cameras around the set.\n; [[Best boy]] (grip)\n: The best boy is chief assistant to the key grip. They are also responsible for organizing the grip truck throughout the day.\n; [[Dolly grip]]\n: The grip in charge of operating the [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]] and [[Crane shot|camera cranes]] is called the dolly grip. They place, level, and move the dolly track, then push and pull the dolly, and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.\n; [[Grip (job)|Grips]]\n: Grips report to the key grip and are responsible for lifting heavy things and setting rigging points for lights.\n; Sound Grip\n: Similar to grips, in regards to the kinds of role they play on set; however, sound grips will also report to the production sound mixer and serve as a critical link between these departments.\n\n== Production sound ==\n\n; [[Production sound mixer]]\n: The production sound mixer (or sound recordist) is the head of the Sound Department on location and is responsible for the operation of the audio Mixer and Recorder(s) which receive feeds from the microphones on set. It is their responsibility to decide how they will deploy their team to capture the sound for each shot, select which microphones will be used for each setup, mix audio from all of the microphones in real time into a \"mix track\" that will be used while viewing rushes and during the edit, and sometimes in the final film, and to maintain logs of audio related issues for post production. The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound.\n; [[Boom operator (media)|Boom operator]]\n: The boom operator, first assistant sound or \"1st AS\", is responsible for utilising microphones on the end of boom poles (lightweight telescopic poles made of aluminium, or more commonly, carbon fibre) held above actor's heads during a scene to capture dialogue. It is also their responsibility to relay information from the \"floor\" back to the production sound mixer regarding upcoming shots, troublesome noises that the mixer will need to be made aware of if they can't be silenced, and for mounting radio microphones on actors. In France, the boom operator is called the [[Perchman]].\n; Second assistant sound\n: The second assistant sound, sound utility technician, or \"2nd AS\", is the assistant to the boom operator and is responsible for moving and preparing sound equipment for use around the set while the boom op watches rehearsals and prepares for the next shot, as well as handling wireless audio feeds to the director, script supervisor and producers, and laying carpet and other sound dampening materials in locations with problematic floors or a troublesome acoustic. In addition, the 2nd AS is regularly called upon to operate a second boom in scenes with a larger number of actors or where actors are physically spaced too far apart for the 1st AS to cover all of the dialogue with one microphone. The 2nd AS also regularly aids in the radio mic'ing of cast when there are a large number of actors in a scene. The term \"sound utility technician\" is now considered an outdated term by [[BECTU]] in the UK and 2nd AS is preferred, with sound utility technician as a role being omitted from recent versions of the rate card.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bectu.org.uk/advice-resources/library/1568 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603005305/https://www.bectu.org.uk/advice-resources/library/1568 |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The role is sometimes informally known as a \"cable wrangler\" or \"cable boy\".\n\n== Art department ==\n\nThe art department in a major feature film can often number hundreds of people. Usually it is considered to include several sub-departments: the art department proper, with its art director, set designers and draftsmen; set decoration, under the set decorator; props, under the props master; construction, headed by the construction coordinator; scenic, headed by the key scenic artist; and special effects.\n\n; [[Production designer]]\n\n: The production designer is responsible for creating the visual appearance of the film \u2013 settings, costumes, character makeup, all taken as a unit. The production designer works closely with the director and the director of photography to achieve the ''look'' of the film.\n\n=== Art (sets and graphic art) ===\n\nWithin the overall art department is a sub-department, also called the art department\u2014which can be confusing. This consists of the people who design the sets and create the graphic art.\n\n; [[Art director#In film|Art director]]\n: The art director reports to the production designer, and more directly oversees artists and craftspeople, such as the set designers, graphic artists, and illustrators who give form to the production design as it develops. The art director works closely with the construction coordinator and key scenic artist to oversee the aesthetic and textural details of sets as they are realized. Typically, the art director oversees the budget and schedule of the overall art department. On large-budget productions with numerous sets and several art directors, one might be credited as ''' supervising art director''' or ''' senior art director'''.\n; Standby art director\n: In the organizational system used in the UK and Ireland, the standby art director monitors the art department's work on set during filming on behalf of the production designer. They work closely with the standby painters and standby carpenters, and co-ordinate any changes to the set during filming. In the North American system, this work is shared between the props master and the on-set dresser.\n; Assistant art director\n: The first, second and third assistant art directors carry out the instructions of the art director. Their work often involves measuring locations and collecting other pertinent information for the production designer. Sometimes a set designer is also the first assistant art director. In this capacity, they manage the workflow and act as the ''foreman'' of the drawing office.\n; [[Set designer]]\n: The set designer is the draftsman, often an architect, who realizes the structures or interior spaces called for by the production designer.\n; [[Illustrator]]\n: The illustrator draws or paints visual representations of the designs to communicate the ideas imagined by the production designer. Illustrators are sometimes credited as concept artists.\n; [[Graphic artist]]\n: The graphic artist is responsible for the design and creation of all graphic elements, including: signs, billboards, posters, logos, nameplates, and automotive-wrapping \u2014 that are created specifically for the film. They will often create several versions of a design, the preferred of which then being chosen by the production designer. On certain productions, they may also be employed, under the direction of the props master, in the creation of small, printed items, such as fliers, receipts, bills of sale, etc.\n\n=== Sets ===\n\n; [[Set decorator]]\n: The set decorator is in charge of the decorating of a film set, which includes the furnishings and all the other objects that will be seen in the film. They work closely with the production designer and coordinate with the art director. In recognition of the set decorator's importance, the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for art direction is given jointly to both the production designer and the set decorator.\n; Buyer\n: The buyer works with, and reports to, the set decorator. The buyer locates, and then purchases or rents the set dressing.\n; [[Leadman]]\n: The leadman (or leadsman) is the foreman of the set dressing crew, often referred to as the [[swing gang]]. They also assist the set decorator.\n; Set dresser\n: The set dressers apply and remove the \"dressing\"; i.e., furniture, drapery, carpets, wall signs, vinyl decals\u2014everything one would find in a location, (even doorknobs and wall sockets, when such items do not fall under the purview of construction.) Most of the swing gang's work occurs before and after the shooting crew arrives, but one set dresser remains with the shooting crew and is known as the ''' on-set dresser'''. In some countries, such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] or the [[United Kingdom]], the set dressing department is referred to as ''' dressing props''' department. Informally, in the U.S., the department is often referred to simply as ''set dec''.\n; [[Greensman]]\n: The greensman is a specialised set dresser dealing with the artistic arrangement or landscape design of plant material, sometimes real and sometimes artificial, and usually a combination of both. Depending on the scope of the greens work in a film, the greensman may report to the art director or may report directly to the production designer. If a significant amount of greens work is required in a film, then the greens may be an identifiable sub-department, with its own team \u2013 often of a size numbering double figures \u2013 and hierarchy (e.g., Greensmaster, greens supervisor, foreperson, leading hand, laborers). Specialists from other areas of the art dept. (e.g., Fabricators, sculptors, painters/Scenics) may also be drafted to work exclusively on greens.\n\n=== Construction ===\n\n; Construction coordinator\n: The construction coordinator oversees the construction of all the sets. The coordinator orders materials, schedules the work, and supervises the often sizeable construction crew of carpenters, painters and labourers. In some jurisdictions the construction coordinator is called the ''' construction manager'''.\n; Head carpenter\n: The head carpenter is the foreman of a ''gang'' of carpenters and laborers.\n; Propmaker\n: The propmaker, as the name implies, builds the props that are used for the film. In US jurisdictions, propmakers are carpenters who build props and sets, and are often technicians skilled in wood and metalwork.\n\n=== Scenic ===\n\n; [[Charge scenic artist|Key scenic]]\n: The key scenic artist is responsible for the surface treatments of the sets. This includes special paint treatments such as aging and gilding, as well as simulating the appearance of wood, stone, brick, metal, stained glass--anything called for by the production designer. The key scenic artist supervises the crew of painters, and is often a master craftsperson. In the UK, the above responsibilities would normally be those of the ''' head painter''', and the scenic artist is responsible for producing artist painted backings. In the US a key scenic is called the ''' charge scenic '''.\n; Head of Plaster\n: The Head of the Plastering Department is responsible for managing Fibrous Plasterers, who are highly skilled plasters who can re-create any period, using mold making and casting abilities.\n\n=== Property ===\n\n; [[Property Master|Propmaster]]\n: The property master is in charge of finding and managing all the [[Theatrical property|props]] that appear in the film. These include any item handled by an actor that is not part of the scenery or costumes, and all consumable food items that appear on screen. Job responsibilities include purchasing, renting, and manufacturing anything an actor handles or touches. In period works, it is the property master's job to ensure that all the props provided are accurate to the time period. The propmaster usually has several assistants. The Assistant Propmaster generally is the person running the set and in charge of working directly with the actors, director and on set crew.\n; [[Weapons master]]\n: The weapons master, or ''' armorer''', is a specialized prop technician who deals with firearms. In most jurisdictions this requires special training and licenses.\n\n=== Costume department ===\n\n; [[Costume designer]]\n: The costume designer is responsible for all the clothing and costumes worn by all the actors that appear on screen. They are also responsible for designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colors, and sizes. The costume designer works closely with the director to understand and interpret \"character\", and counsels with the production designer to achieve an overall tone of the film. In large productions, the costume designer will usually have one or more assistant costume designers.\n; Costume supervisor\n: The costume supervisor works closely with the designer. In addition to helping with the design of the costumes, they manage the wardrobe workspace. They supervise construction or sourcing of garments, hiring and firing of support staff, budget, paperwork, and department logistics. Also called the ''' wardrobe supervisor''', although this term is used less and less.\n; Key costumer\n: The key costumer is employed on larger productions to manage the set costumers, and to handle the star's wardrobe needs.\n; Costume standby\n: The costume standby is present on set at all times. It is his/her responsibility to monitor the quality and continuity of the actors and actresses costumes before and during takes. (S)he will also assist the actors and actresses with dressing.\n; Breakdown artist\n: A breakdown artist may be employed during the pre-production period to ''break down'' garments. This specialized job includes making new clothing appear dirty, faded and worn.\n; Costume buyer\n: On large productions a buyer may be employed to source and purchase fabrics and garments. A buyer might also be referred to as a ''' shopper'''. This distinction is often made when the lead actor in a production has control over their wardrobe, and they may personally hire this person.\n; Cutter\n: A costume technician who fits or tailors costumes, usually on-set. They might also be called ''' fitter''', ''' seamstress''' or ''' tailor'''. Some celebrity actors have favorite cutters, and larger productions may hire several and have them on set at the same time, particularly in period film projects that might have complicated or expensive extras wardrobe.\n\n=== Hair and make-up ===\n\nSome actors or actresses have personal makeup artists or hair stylists.\n\n; [[Make-up artist|Key make-up artist]]\n: The key makeup artist is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. They are responsible for planning makeup designs for all leading and supporting cast. Their department includes all cosmetic makeup, body makeup and if special effects are involved, the key make-up artist will consult with a special effects makeup team to create all prosthetics and SFX makeup in a production. It is common that the key makeup artist performs makeup applications on lead cast, with assistance, and allows other crew members to work with supporting and minor roles. The key makeup artist will normally execute especially complicated or important makeup processes that are to be featured on camera.\n; Special make-up effects Artist (SFX makeup)\n:A special effects make-up artist works with live models or structures in the entertainment industry, applying make-up effects or [[prosthetics]]. May be an own department that answers directly to the director and production designer or reports to the Key make-up artist.\n; Make-up supervisor\n: The make-up supervisor is a supporting position that normally reports to the key makeup artist to assist in running the makeup department. Make-up supervisors typically handle production matters and generally serve the needs of senior artists. Makeup supervisors rarely do makeup themselves. Their duties can include keeping a record of makeup continuity, handing the scheduling of makeup teams and providing for the general needs of the makeup department. They are expected to be a connection between the makeup department and the rest of the production departments, making sure that makeup supplies, production assistants or electricians are on hand when needed.\n; [[Make-up artist]]\n: Make-up artists work with makeup, hair and special effects to create the characters look for anyone appearing on screen. They assist and report to the key make-up artist.\n; [[Hairdresser|Key hair]]\n: The key hair is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. The key hair will normally design and style the hair of lead actors.\n; Hair stylist\n:The ''' hair stylist''', is responsible for maintaining and styling the hair, including wigs and extensions, of anyone appearing on screen. They assist and report to the key hair.\n\n== Special effects ==\n\nThis department oversees the mechanical effects\u2014also called [[Practical effect|practical]] or [[physical effects]]\u2014that create optical illusions during live-action shooting. It is not to be confused with the [[Visual effects]] department, which adds photographic effects during filming to be altered later during [[video editing]] in the [[post-production]] process.\n\n; [[Special effects supervisor]]\n: The special effects supervisor instructs the [[Special effects]] crew on how to design moving set elements and props that will safely break, explode, burn, collapse and implode without destroying the film set. S/he is also responsible for reproducing weather conditions and other on-camera ''magic''.\n; Special effects assistant\n: The SFX assistants carry out the instructions of the special effects supervisor, building set pieces like breakaway furniture and cities in miniature, lighting pyrotechnics, and setting up rigging equipment for stunts.\n\n== Stunts ==\n\n; [[Stunt coordinator]]\n: Where the film requires a [[stunt]] and involves the use of [[stunt performer]]s, the stunt coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the stunt, working closely with the director and the 1st AD.\n\n== Post-production ==\n\n; Post-production supervisor\n: Post-production supervisors are responsible for the post-production process, during which they maintain clarity of information and good channels of communication between the producer, editor, supervising sound editor, the facilities companies (such as film labs, CGI studios and negative cutters) and the production accountant. Although this is not a creative role, it is pivotal in ensuring that the film's post-production budget is manageable and achievable, and that all deadlines are met. Because large amounts of money are involved, and most of a film's budget is spent during production, the post-production period can often be difficult and challenging.\n\n=== Editorial ===\n; [[Film editor]]\n: The film editor is the person who assembles the various shots into a coherent film, with the help of the director. There are usually several assistant editors.\n; Negative cutter\n: The negative cutter cuts and splices the negatives as directed by the film editor, and then provides the assembled negative reels to the lab in order for prints (positives for projection) to be made.\n; [[Color grading|Colorist]]\n: With a photochemical process, the color timer adjusts the color of the film via printer lights for greater consistency in the film's colors. With a [[digital intermediate]] process, the colorist can use digital tools in manipulating the image and has greater creative freedom in changing the aesthetic of a film.\n; Telecine colorist\n: A Telecine colorist is responsible for a ''grade'' \u2013 that is a look that has been created with a grading system, which adjusts brightness, contrast and color.\n\n=== Visual effects ===\n\n[[Visual effects]] commonly refers to post-production alterations of the film's images. The on set VFX crew works to prepare shots and plates for future visual effects. This may include adding tracking markers, taking and asking for reference plates and helping the [[Executive director|Director]] understand the limitations and ease of certain shots that will effect the future post production. A VFX crew can also work alongside the [[Special effects]] department for any on-set optical effects that need physical representation during filming (on camera.)\n\n; Visual effects producer\n: The visual effects producer works with the visual effects supervisor to break down the script into storyboards, and advises the director as to how s/he should approach the scenes. Together they determine which sequences are to be shot as live action elements, which would work well in miniature, and which (if any) should be computer generated.\n; [[VFX Creative Director|Visual effects creative director]]\n: VFX creative directors are very much like production designers, except they direct and supervise the creative side of the film's visual effects. The position is particularly in demand for films with massive amounts of computer generated imagery and scenes.\n; [[Visual effects supervisor]]\n: The visual effects supervisor is in charge of the VFX crew, working with production and the film's director to achieve the desired in-camera optical effects of the film.\n; Visual effects editor\n: The visual effects editor incorporates visual effects into the current cuts of live action sequences, producing multiple versions of each shot. Altered scenes are then evaluated by the visual effects supervisor and creative director for aesthetic and technical direction, and by the producers for review and final editing.\n; Compositor\n: A compositor is a visual effects artist responsible for [[compositing]] images from different sources such as video, film, computer generated 3-D imagery, 2-D animations, matte paintings, photographs, and text.\n; Rotoscope artists/ paint artists\n: Rotoscope & painters artists may [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the footage, manually creating [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] for use in compositing.

These sound effects are recorded in sync to picture and are mostly body movements, footsteps or object manipulations. The most common reason for recording these effects live to picture is the fact that such sounds are lost when the dialogue is removed to be replaced by a foreign language version. Unsatisfactorily recorded sync sound effects can also be replaced with foley effects. Foley artists are also known as foley walkers. Foley is named after its first known practitioner, an early hollywood sound editor named Jack Foley.\n\n; Conductor/ Orchestrator\n: A conductor is supposed to be knowledable of special synchronization procedures to conduct the score to an orchestra.

In [[traditional animation]], the nature of the medium meant that ''everything'' was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters, making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant. Because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive, animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated.\n\nHowever, since the turn of the 21st century, modern [[3D computer graphics]] and [[computer animation]] have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before. Many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians, grips, costume designers, props masters, set decorators, set dressers, and cinematographers. They make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts, but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set. There have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of [[hair]] since 2005, meaning that hairstylists have been called in since then to consult on a few animation projects.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Film}}\n\n* [[Glossary of motion picture terms]]\n* [[Outline of film]]\n* [[Production team]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\n* {{Cite book |author = Katz, Ephraim |title = The Film Encyclopedia (5ed) |publisher = Collins |year = 2005 |isbn = 0-06-074214-3 }}\n* {{Cite book |author = Knox, Dave |title = Strike the Baby and Kill the Blonde: An Insider's Guide to Film Slang |publisher = Three Rivers Press |year = 2005 |isbn = 1-4000-9759-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |author = Levy, Frederick |title = Hollywood 101: The Film Industry |publisher = Renaissance Books |year = 2000 |isbn = 1-58063-123-1 }}\n\n{{Film crew}}\n{{Filmmaking}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Filmmaking occupations| ]]", "sha1": "bsa7w1ibnxvluhcam1s9zjo3uxvbb8x"}}, {"title": "Fear", "ns": "0", "id": "10828", "revision": {"id": "865718706", "parentid": "865718667", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T18:15:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/207.62.97.28|207.62.97.28]] ([[User talk:207.62.97.28|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{redirect-multi|2|Scared|Terror}}\n[[File:Depression - a lonely alcoholic in fear covers his face with his hands.jpg|thumb|300px|A lonely alcoholic in [[Moscow]] wearing a jacket during winter season.

Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a [[risk]] to body or life. The fear response arises from the [[perception]] of [[Risk|danger]] leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the [[fight-or-flight response]]), which in extreme cases of fear ([[horror and terror]]) can be a freeze response or [[paralysis]]. \n \nIn humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of [[cognition]] and learning. Thus fear is judged as [[rational]] or appropriate and [[irrational]] or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a [[phobia]].\n\n[[Psychologist]]s such as [[John B. Watson]], [[Robert Plutchik]], and [[Paul Ekman]] have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or [[innate]] emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as [[acute stress reaction]], [[anger]], [[angst]], [[anxiety]], fright, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], [[joy]], [[panic]], and [[sadness]]. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion [[anxiety]], which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable.<ref>\u00d6hman, A.

Organization Studies</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nMany physiological changes in the body are associated with fear, summarized as the [[fight-or-flight response]]. An inborn response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate ([[hyperventilation]]), heart rate, vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blushing and sanskadania of the central vessels (pooling),  increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing \"goose bumps\", or more clinically, [[piloerection]] (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose ([[hyperglycemia]]), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and \"butterflies in the stomach\" ([[dyspepsia]]). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edmundson|first=Laurel Duphiney|title=The Neurobiology of Fear|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro00/web2/Edmundson.html|publisher=Serendip|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.\n\n==Causes==\nPeople develop specific fears as a result of learning. This has been studied in psychology as [[fear conditioning]], beginning with John B. Watson's [[Little Albert experiment]] in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a ball of cotton.\n\nFear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, he or she may develop a fear of wells, heights ([[acrophobia]]), enclosed spaces ([[claustrophobia]]), or water ([[aquaphobia]]). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps, the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Olsson | first1 = A. \n| last2 = Nearing | first2 = K.

For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared [[polio]], a disease that can lead to paralysis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001402.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129024916/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001402.htm |archivedate=2017-01-29 |df= }}</ref> There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Display rules]] affect how likely people are to show the facial expression of fear and other emotions.\n\nAlthough many fears are learned, the capacity to fear is part of [[human nature]]. Many studies {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} have found that certain fears (e.g. animals, heights) are much more common than others (e.g. flowers, clouds). These fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory. This phenomenon is known as [[preparedness (learning)|preparedness]]. Because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce, preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of [[natural selection]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=\u00d6hman|first1=Arne|last2=Mineka|first2=Susan|title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning|journal=Psychological Review|date=2001|volume=108|issue=3|pages=483\u2013522|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483|pmid=11488376}}</ref>\n\nFrom an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, different fears may be different [[adaptation]]s that have been useful in our evolutionary past.

Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all [[simian]]s and developed during the [[cenozoic]] time period.

Yale Open Course 2007.</ref> by examining the following questions: Is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response? What conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death? What is meant by fear, and how much fear is appropriate? According to Kagan for fear in general to make sense, three conditions should be met:\n# the object of fear needs to be \"something bad\"\n# there needs to be a non-negligible chance that the bad state of affairs will happen\n# there needs to be some uncertainty about the bad state of affairs\nThe amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of \"the bad\". If the three conditions are not met, fear is an inappropriate emotion. He argues, that death does not meet the first two criteria, even if death is a \"deprivation of good things\" and even if one believes in a painful afterlife. Because death is certain, it also does not meet the third criterion, but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies ''may'' be cause to a sense of fear.<ref name=\"Kagan\" />\n\nIn a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men, aged 65\u201387, low [[self-efficacy]] predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. Fear of death was measured by a \"Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale\" which included the 8 subscales Fear of Dying, Fear of the Dead, Fear of Being Destroyed, Fear for Significant Others, Fear of the Unknown, Fear of Conscious Death, Fear for the Body After Death, and Fear of Premature Death. In [[hierarchical multiple regression]] analysis the most potent predictors of death fears were low \"spiritual health efficacy\", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low \"instrumental efficacy\", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.<ref name=\"Fry\"/>\n\nPsychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear; however, empirical research on this topic has been equivocal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. \"Intrinsic religiosity\", as opposed to mere \"formal religious involvement\", has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety.<ref name=\"Fry\"/> In a 1976 study of people of various Christian denominations, those who were most firm in their faith, who attended religious services weekly, were the least afraid of dying.

Irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears, a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat. Many people are scared of the \"unknown\". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use '''F'''alse '''E'''vidence '''A'''ppearing '''R'''eal as a definition, alternatively therapists use it as acronym for '''F'''eeling frightened, '''E'''xpecting bad things to happen, '''A'''ctions and attitudes that can help, and '''R'''ewards and results in Rx programs like [[Coping Cat]].

For example, parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place.

These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Stephen|title=21st Century Psychology: A Reference Handbook, Vol. 1|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publication, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-4968-2|pages=282\u2013286}}</ref> These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.\n\nAs with many functions of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert|first=Patrick|title=The Amygdala and Its Allies|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html|website=2002|publisher=The Brain|accessdate=2 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074559/http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=}}</ref>  The [[amygdala]] communicates both directions between the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[hypothalamus]], the [[sensory cortex]], the [[hippocampus]], [[thalamus]], [[septum]], and the  [[brainstem]].

Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become \"wild\" again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, are seen to be more important in SSDRs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened. The wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species-specific defense reactions or behaviors. Bolles believed that SSDRs are conditioned through [[Pavlovian]] conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDRs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kiein|first=Stephen|title=Biological Influences on Learning|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Mississippi State University|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072490462/student_view0/chapter10/chapter_outline.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080132/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072490462/student_view0/chapter10/chapter_outline.html|archivedate=2008-12-05|df=}}</ref> [[Michael S.

Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a '''football club''', group, state or nation, an [[All-star game|all-star team]] or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a [[wikt:dream team|Dream Team]] or [[team of the century|Team of the Century]]) and never play an actual match.  \n\n==Summary==\nThere are several varieties of football, notably [[association football]], [[gridiron football]], [[Australian rules football]], [[Gaelic football]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]]. The number of players selected for each team within these varieties and their associated codes can vary substantially. Sometimes, the word \"team\" is limited to those who play on the field in a match and does not always include other players who may take part as replacements or emergency players. \"Football [[squad]]\" may be used to be inclusive of these support and reserve players.\n\nThe term football club is the most commonly used for a [[sports club]] which is an organised or incorporated body with a president, committee and a set of rules responsible for ensuring the continued playing existence of one or more teams which are selected for regular competition play (and which may participate in several different [[division (sport)|divisions]] or leagues). The [[oldest football clubs]] date back to the early 19th century. The words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters, although they typically refer to the team within the club playing in the highest division or competition.\n\n==Variation of player numbers among football codes==\n[[File:PortAdelaide1914.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The 18 senior players of [[Port Adelaide Football Club]]'s 1914 [[Champions of Australia]] team]]\nThe number of players that take part in the sport simultaneously, thus forming the team are:\n\n*Association football: 11<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-3---the-players|title=Law 3 - The Players|last=Association|first=The Football|website=www.thefa.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref>\n**Indoor soccer: 6\n**Futsal, beach soccer, five-a-side football: 5\n*American football: 11\n**Arena football: 8\n*Canadian football: 12\n*Rugby league: 13\n*Rugby union: 15\n**Rugby sevens: 7\n*Gaelic football: 15\n*Australian rules football: 18\n\n==Lists of association football teams==\n*[[List of association football clubs]]\n*[[List of men's national association football teams]]\n*[[List of women's association football clubs]]\n*[[List of women's national association football teams]]\n\n==Lists of Australian rules football teams==\n*[[List of Australian rules football clubs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Football Team}}\n[[Category:Football teams| ]]", "sha1": "fpa5npk8r9f27iwozdutxwei71i9qvq"}}, {"title": "F", "ns": "0", "id": "10831", "revision": {"id": "857928084", "parentid": "857928067", "timestamp": "2018-09-03T23:13:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "Airplaneman", "id": "6457542"}, "comment": "Adding {{pp-vandalism}} ([[WP:TW|TW]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{About|the letter of the alphabet}}\n{{distinguish|text=the [[long s]], \u017f}}{{Technical reasons|F#|other uses|F-sharp (disambiguation){{!}}F-sharp}}\n{{Infobox grapheme\n|name=F\n|letter=F f\n|variations=([[F#Related characters|See below]])\n|image=File:F cursiva.gif\n|imagesize=200px\n|imagealt=Writing cursive forms of F\n|boxsize=\n|script=[[Latin script]]\n|type=[[Alphabet]]\n|typedesc=ic\n|language=[[Latin language]]\n|phonemes=[{{IPAlink|f}}]<br>[{{IPAlink|\u0278}}~[[Japanese phonology|h]]]<br>[{{IPAlink|\u028d}}~{{IPAlink|\u028d|x\u02b7}}]<br>[{{IPAlink|v}}]<br>{{IPAc-en|\u025b|f}}\n|unicode=U+0046, U+0066\n|alphanumber=6\n|number=6\n|fam1=<hiero>G43</hiero><hiero>T3</hiero>\n|fam2=[[Image:Proto-semiticW-01.svg|20px|Waw]]\n|fam3=[[File:PhoenicianW-01.png|20px]]\n|fam4=[[Image:Phoenician waw.svg|20px|Waw]]\n|fam5=[[Image:Waw.svg|20px]]\n|fam6=[[Digamma|\u03dc \u03dd \u03db]]\n|fam7=[[\ud800\udf05]]\n|usageperiod=~-700 to present\n|children={{bull}}[[\u1e1e]]<br>{{bull}}[[\u20a3]]<br>{{bull}}[[\u2109]]<br>{{bull}}[[Female human|\ua7fb]]<br>{{bull}}[[\uab35]]<br>{{bull}}[[\u222b]]<br>{{bull}}[[\ud834\udd91]]\n|sisters=[[U]]<br>[[V]]<br>[[W]]<br>[[Y]]<br>[[\u01b1]]<br>[[\u0423]]<br>[[\u040e]]<br>[[\u04b0]]<br>[[Upsilon|\u03a5 \u03c5]]<br>[[Waw (letter)|\u05d5<br>\u05d5\u05bc<br>\u05d5\u05b9<br>\u0648<br>\u06cb<br>\u0718]]<br>[[\u0805]]<br>[[\ud800\udf86]]<br>[[\ud800\udf16]]<br>[[wikt:\u054e|\u054e]] [[wikt:\u057e|\u057e]]<br>[[wikt:\u0548|\u0548]] [[wikt:\u0578|\u0578]]<br>[[wikt:\u0552|\u0552]] [[wikt:\u0582|\u0582]]<br>[[wikt:\u0587|\u0587]]\n|equivalents=[[U]]<br>[[V]]<br>[[W]]<br>[[Y]]\n|associates=[[List of Latin-script digraphs#F|f(x)]]\n|direction=Left-to-Right\n}}\n{{Latin letter info|f}}\n'''F''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''ef''<ref>Spelled ''eff'' as a verb</ref> {{IPAc-en|\u025b|f}})<ref>\"F\", ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989); \"ef\", \"eff\", \"bee\" (under \"bee eff\"), ''op. cit.''</ref> is the sixth [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the [[English alphabet|modern English alphabet]] and the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].\n\n==History==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-  bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n!

Graphically it originally probably depicted either a hook or a club. It may have been based on a comparable [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] such as [[List of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: M-Z#M|that which represented the word ''mace'']] (transliterated as \u1e25(dj)): <hiero>T3</hiero>\n\nThe Phoenician form of the letter was adopted into Greek as a vowel, ''[[upsilon]]'' (which resembled its descendant '[[Y]]' but was also the ancestor of the Roman letters '[[U]]', '[[V]]', and '[[W]]'); and, with another form, as a consonant, ''[[digamma]]'', which indicated the pronunciation {{IPA|/w/}}, as in Phoenician. Latin 'F,' despite being pronounced differently, is ultimately descended from digamma and closely resembles it in form.\n\nAfter sound changes eliminated {{IPA|/w/}} from spoken Greek, ''digamma'' was used only as a numeral. However, the Greek alphabet also gave rise to other alphabets, and some of these retained letters descended from digamma. In the [[Etruscan alphabet]], 'F' probably represented {{IPA|/w/}}, as in Greek, and the Etruscans formed the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] 'FH' to represent {{IPA|/f/}}.  (At the time these letters were borrowed, there was no Greek letter that represented /f/: the Greek letter [[phi]] '\u03a6' then represented an aspirated [[voiceless bilabial plosive]] {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}, although in Modern Greek it has come to represent {{IPA|/f/}}.) When the Romans adopted the alphabet, they used 'V' (from Greek ''upsilon'') not only for the vowel {{IPA|/u/}}, but also for the corresponding semivowel {{IPA|/w/}}, leaving 'F' available for {{IPA|/f/}}.  And so out of the various ''vav'' variants in the Mediterranean world, the letter F entered the Roman alphabet attached to a sound which its antecedents in Greek and Etruscan did not have. The Roman alphabet forms the basis of the alphabet used today for English and many other languages.\n\nThe [[lowercase]] 'f' is not related to the visually similar [[long s]], '\u017f' (or [[medial s]]). The use of the ''long s'' largely died out by the beginning of the 19th century, mostly to prevent confusion with 'f' when using a short mid-bar (see more at: [[S]]).\n\n==Use in writing systems==\n\n===English===\n\nIn [[English orthography|the English writing system]] {{angbr|f}} is used to represent the sound {{IPAc-en|f}}, the [[voiceless labiodental fricative]]. It is often doubled at the end of words. Exceptionally, it represents the [[voiced labiodental fricative]] {{IPAc-en|v}} in the common word \"of\".\n\n===Other languages===\nIn the writing systems of other languages, {{angbr|f}} commonly represents {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|[\u0278]}} or {{IPA|/v/}}.\n*In [[French orthography]], {{angbr|f}} is used to represent {{IPA|/f/}}. It may also be silent at the end of words.\n*In [[Spanish orthography]], {{angbr|f}} is used to represent {{IPA|/f/}}. \n*In the [[Hepburn romanization]] of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{angbr|f}} is used to represent {{IPA|[\u0278]}}. This sound is usually considered to be an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/h/}}, which is pronounced in different ways depending upon its context; Japanese {{IPA|/h/}} is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0278]}} before {{IPA|/u/}}.\n*In [[Welsh orthography]], {{angbr|f}} represents {{IPA|/v/}} while {{angbr|ff}} represents {{IPA|/f/}}.\n*In [[Slavic language]]s, {{angbr|f}} is used primarily in words of foreign (Greek, Latin, or Germanic) origin.\n*In spoken [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], {{angbr|f}} in the middle of a word is often pronounced as a v (e.g. A\u00f0 sofa - to sleep).\n\n===International Phonetic Alphabet===\nThe [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses {{angbr|{{IPA|f}}}} to represent the [[voiceless labiodental fricative]].\n\n===In mathematics===\nAn italic letter {{mvar|f}} is conventionally used to denote an arbitrary [[function (mathematics)|function]]. See also [[f with hook]] (\u0192).\n\n==Related characters==\n<!-- Please only list characters (symbols in a writing system, but not just convenience code points in Unicode) that are actually related in terms of origin to the letter that is the topic of this article.

Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the [[enzymatic browning]] reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation.\n\nMany processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method.

In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] classified processed meat, i.e. meat that has undergone salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, as \"[[carcinogenic]] to humans\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/news/world-health-organization-says-processed-meat-causes-cancer|title=World Health Organization Says Processed Meat Causes Cancer|author= Stacy Simon |work=Cancer.org |date= 26 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34615621 |title = Processed meats do cause cancer - WHO|author= James Gallagher|work= BBC |date=26 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_E.pdf| title=IARC Monographs evaluate consumption of red meat and processed meat |work= International Agency for Research on Cancer |date= 26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaintaining or creating nutritional value, [[wikt:texture|texture]] and [[flavor]] is an important aspect of food preservation.\n\n== Traditional techniques ==\nNew techniques of food preservation became available to the home chef from the dawn of [[agriculture]] until the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n=== Curing ===\n[[File:Prague powder No 1.jpg|thumb|Bag of Prague powder #1, also known as \"[[curing salt]]\" or \"pink salt\". It is typically a combination of salt and sodium nitrite, with the pink color added to distinguish it from ordinary salt.]]\n{{Main|Curing (food preservation)}}\nThe earliest form of curing was dehydration or [[Food drying|drying]], used as early as 12,000&nbsp;BC. [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] and [[salting (food)|salting]] techniques improve on the drying process and add antimicrobial agents that aid in preservation. Smoke deposits a number of pyrolysis products onto the food, including the [[phenol]]s [[syringol]], [[guaiacol]] and [[catechol]].<ref name=\"Msagati, T. 2012\">Msagati, T. (2012). \"The Chemistry of Food Additives and Preservatives\"</ref> Salt accelerates the drying process using [[osmosis]] and also inhibits the growth of several common strains of bacteria. More recently [[nitrite]]s have been used to cure meat, contributing a characteristic pink colour.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nummer|first1=Brian|last2=Andress|first2=Elizabeth|title=Curing and Smoking Meats for Home Food Preservation|url=http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/lit_rev/cure_smoke_cure.html|publisher=National Center for Home Food Preservation|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooling ===\n{{Main|Refrigeration}}\n[[Refrigeration|Cooling]] preserves food by slowing down the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and the action of enzymes that causes the food to rot. The introduction of commercial and domestic refrigerators drastically improved the diets of many in the [[Western world]] by allowing food such as fresh fruit, salads and dairy products to be stored safely for longer periods, particularly during warm weather.\n\nBefore the era of mechanical refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of [[root cellar]]s and [[icebox]]es. Rural people often did their own [[ice cutting]], whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the [[ice trade]]. Today, root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including [[local food]], [[heirloom plant|heirloom crops]], traditional home [[list of cooking techniques|cooking techniques]], [[family farm]]ing, [[frugality]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[organic farming]], and others.\n\n=== Freezing ===\n\n{{Main|Frozen food}}\n[[Freezing]] is also one of the most commonly used processes, both commercially and domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared foods that would not have required freezing in their unprepared state. For example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cool dark place to ensure many months' storage. Cold stores provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case of national emergency in many countries.\n\n=== Boiling ===\n{{Main|Boiling}}\nBoiling liquid food items can kill any existing microbes. Milk and water are often boiled to kill any harmful microbes that may be present in them.\n\n=== Heating ===\nHeating to temperatures which are sufficient to kill microorganisms inside the food is a method used with [[perpetual stew]]s. Milk is also boiled before storing to kill many microorganisms.\n\n=== Sugaring ===\n{{see also |Sugaring}} \nThe earliest cultures have used [[sugar]] as a [[preservative]], and it was commonplace to store [[fruit]] in [[honey]]. Similar to pickled foods, [[sugar cane]] was brought to Europe through the trade routes. In northern climates without sufficient sun to dry foods, [[preserves]] are made by heating the fruit with sugar.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\">Nummer, B. (2002). \"Historical Origins of Food Preservation\" http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html. (Accessed on 5 May 2014)</ref> \"Sugar tends to draw water from the microbes (plasmolysis). This process leaves the microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them.  In this way, the food will remain safe from microbial spoilage.\"<ref name=\"Msagati, T. 2012\" /> Sugar is used to preserve fruits, either in an [[antimicrobial]] syrup with fruit such as [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, and [[plum]]s, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is cooked in sugar to the point of crystallization and the resultant product is then stored dry. This method is used for the skins of [[citrus]] fruit (candied peel), [[angelica]], and [[ginger]]. Also, sugaring can be used in the production of [[jam]] and [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]].\n\n=== Pickling ===\n{{Main|Pickling}}\nPickling is a method of preserving food in an edible, antimicrobial liquid. Pickling can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling.\n\nIn chemical pickling, the food is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include [[brine]] (high in salt), [[vinegar]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], and [[vegetable oil]]. Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. Common chemically pickled foods include [[Pickled cucumber|cucumbers]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[corned beef]], [[herring]], and [[Pickled egg|eggs]], as well as mixed vegetables such as [[piccalilli]].\n\nIn fermentation pickling, bacteria in the liquid produce [[organic acid]]s as preservation agents, typically by a process that produces [[lactic acid]] through the presence of [[lactobacillales]]. Fermented pickles include [[sauerkraut]], [[nukazuke]], [[kimchi]], and [[surstr\u00f6mming]].\n\n=== Lye ===\n{{main|Sodium hydroxide#Food preparation}}\n[[Sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) makes food too [[alkaline]] for bacterial growth. Lye will [[saponification|saponify]] fats in the food, which will change its flavor and texture. [[Lutefisk]] uses lye in its preparation, as do some olive recipes. Modern recipes for [[century egg]]s also call for lye.\n\n=== Canning ===\n\n[[File:PreservedFood1.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved food]]\n{{Main|Canning}}\n{{See also|Home canning}}\n[[Canning]] involves cooking food, sealing it in sterilized cans or jars, and [[boiling]] the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. It was invented by the French confectioner [[Nicolas Appert]].<ref>''Nicolas Appert inventeur et humaniste'' by Jean-Paul Barbier, Paris, 1994 and http://www.appert-aina.com</ref> By 1806, this process was used by the French Navy to preserve meat, fruit, vegetables, and even milk.  Although Appert had discovered a new way of preservation, it wasn't understood until 1864 when [[Louis Pasteur]] found the relationship between microorganisms, food spoilage, and illness.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\" />\n\nFoods have varying degrees of natural protection against spoilage and may require that the final step occur in a [[pressure cooker]]. High-acid fruits like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] require no preservatives to can and only a short boiling cycle, whereas marginal vegetables such as [[carrot]]s require longer boiling and addition of other acidic elements. Low-acid foods, such as vegetables and meats, require pressure canning. Food preserved by canning or bottling is at immediate risk of spoilage once the can or bottle has been opened.\n\nLack of quality control in the canning process may allow ingress of water or micro-organisms. Most such failures are rapidly detected as decomposition within the can causes gas production and the can will swell or burst. However, there have been examples of poor manufacture (underprocessing) and poor [[hygiene]] allowing contamination of canned food by the obligate [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobe]] ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', which produces an acute toxin within the food, leading to severe illness or death. This organism produces no gas or obvious taste and remains undetected by taste or smell. Its toxin is denatured by cooking, however. Cooked [[Mushroom|mushrooms]], handled poorly and then canned, can support the growth of [[Staphylococcus aureus]], which produces a toxin that is not destroyed by canning or subsequent reheating.\n\n=== Jellying ===\n{{Main|Aspic}}{{See also|Potted shrimps|Confit}}\nFood may be preserved by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel. Such materials include [[gelatin]], [[agar]], [[maize]] flour, and [[arrowroot]] flour. Some foods naturally form a [[protein]] gel when cooked, such as [[Eel|eels and elvers]], and [[Sipuncula|sipunculid]] worms, which are a delicacy in [[Xiamen]], in the Fujian province of the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Jellied eel]]s are a delicacy in the East End of [[London]], where they are eaten with mashed potatoes. Potted meats in [[aspic]] (a gel made from gelatin and clarified meat broth) were a common way of serving meat off-cuts in the UK until the 1950s. Many jugged meats are also jellied.\n\nA traditional British way of preserving meat (particularly [[Potted shrimps|shrimp]]) is by setting it in a pot and sealing it with a layer of fat. Also common is potted chicken liver; jellying is one of the steps in producing traditional [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]]s.\n\n=== Jugging ===\n{{Main|Jugging}}\nMeat can be preserved by jugging. Jugging is the process of [[stewing]] the meat (commonly [[game (food)|game]] or [[fish]]) in a covered [[earthenware]] jug or [[casserole]]. The animal to be jugged is usually cut into pieces, placed into a tightly-sealed jug with brine or [[gravy]], and stewed. [[Red wine]] and/or the animal's own blood is sometimes added to the cooking liquid. Jugging was a popular method of preserving meat up until the middle of the 20th century.\n\n=== Burial ===\nBurial of food can preserve it due to a variety of factors: lack of light, lack of oxygen, cool temperatures, pH level, or [[desiccant]]s in the soil. Burial may be combined with other methods such as salting or fermentation. Most foods can be preserved in soil that is very dry and salty (thus a desiccant) such as sand, or soil that is frozen.\n\nMany [[root vegetables]] are very resistant to spoilage and require no other preservation than storage in cool dark conditions, for example by burial in the ground, such as in a [[storage clamp]]. [[Century egg]]s are traditionally created by placing eggs in alkaline mud (or other alkaline substance), resulting in their \"inorganic\" fermentation through raised pH instead of spoiling. The fermentation preserves them and breaks down some of the complex, less flavorful proteins and fats into simpler, more flavorful ones. [[Cabbage]] was traditionally buried during [[Autumn]] in northern US farms for preservation. Some methods keep it crispy while other methods produce [[sauerkraut]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} A similar process is used in the traditional production of [[kimchi]]. Sometimes meat is buried under conditions that cause preservation. If buried on hot coals or ashes, the heat can kill pathogens, the dry ash can desiccate, and the earth can block oxygen and further contamination. If buried where the earth is very cold, the earth acts like a refrigerator.  Before burial, meat (pig/boar) can be fatted.  The tallow of the animal is heated and poured over meat in a barrel.  Once the fat hardens the barrel is sealed and buried in a cold cellar or ground.\n\nIn [[Orissa, India]], it is practical to store rice by burying it underground. This method helps to store for three to six months during the dry season.\n\nButter and similar substances have been preserved as [[bog butter]] in Irish [[peat bogs]] for centuries.\n\n=== Fermentation ===\n{{See also|Fermentation (food)}}\nSome foods, such as many [[cheese]]s, [[wine]]s, and [[beer]]s, use specific micro-organisms that combat spoilage from other less-benign organisms. These micro-organisms keep pathogens in check by creating an environment toxic for themselves and other micro-organisms by producing acid or alcohol. Methods of fermentation include, but are not limited to, starter micro-organisms, salt, hops, controlled (usually cool) temperatures and controlled (usually low) levels of oxygen. These methods are used to create the specific controlled conditions that will support the desirable organisms that produce food fit for human consumption.\n\nFermentation is the microbial conversion of starch and sugars into alcohol. Not only can fermentation produce alcohol, but it can also be a valuable preservation technique. Fermentation can also make foods more nutritious and palatable. For example, drinking water in the Middle Ages was dangerous because it often contained pathogens that could spread disease. When the water is made into beer, the boiling during the brewing process kills any bacteria in the water that could make people sick. Additionally, the water now has the nutrients from the barley and other ingredients, and the microorganisms can also produce vitamins as they ferment.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\" />\n\n== Modern industrial techniques ==\nTechniques of food preservation were developed in research laboratories for commercial applications.\n\n=== Pasteurization ===\n{{Main|Pasteurization}}\nPasteurization is a process for preservation of liquid food. It was originally applied to combat the souring of young local wines. Today, the process is mainly applied to dairy products. In this method, milk is heated at about {{cvt|70|C|F}} for 15\u201330 seconds to kill the bacteria present in it and cooling it quickly to {{cvt|10|C|F}} to prevent the remaining bacteria from growing. The milk is then stored in sterilized bottles or pouches in cold places. This method was invented by [[Louis Pasteur]], a [[French people|French]] chemist, in 1862.\n\n=== Vacuum packing ===\n{{Main|Vacuum packing}}\nVacuum-packing stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag or bottle. The [[vacuum]] environment strips bacteria of oxygen needed for survival. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] to reduce loss of flavor from oxidization. A major drawback to vacuum packaging, at the consumer level, is that vacuum sealing can deform contents and rob certain foods, such as cheese, of its flavor.\n\n=== Freeze drying ===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\n{{main|Freeze drying}}\n\n=== Artificial food additives ===\n{{Main|Preservatives}}\nPreservative food additives can be ''antimicrobial''\u2014which inhibit the growth of [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[Fungus|fungi]], including [[mold]]\u2014or ''[[antioxidant]]'', such as [[oxygen absorber]]s, which inhibit the [[oxidation]] of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include [[calcium propionate]], [[sodium nitrate]], [[sodium nitrite]], [[sulfite]]s ([[sulfur dioxide]], [[sodium bisulfite]], [[potassium hydrogen sulfite]], etc.), and [[EDTA]]. [[Antioxidant]]s include [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT). Other preservatives include [[formaldehyde]] (usually in solution), [[glutaraldehyde]] (insecticide), [[ethanol]], and [[methylchloroisothiazolinone]].\n\n=== Irradiation ===\n{{Main|Food irradiation}}\nIrradiation of food<ref>anon., Food Irradation \u2013 A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food, WHO, Geneva, 1991</ref> is the exposure of food to [[ionizing radiation]]. Multiple types of ionizing radiation can be used, including [[beta particle]]s (high-energy [[electron]]s) and [[gamma ray]]s (emitted from radioactive sources such as [[cobalt-60]] or [[cesium-137]]). Irradiation can kill bacteria, molds, and insect pests, reduce the ripening and spoiling of fruits, and at higher doses induce sterility. The technology may be compared to [[pasteurization]]; it is sometimes called \"cold pasteurization\", as the product is not heated. Irradiation may allow lower-quality or contaminated foods to be rendered marketable.\n\nNational and international expert bodies have declared food irradiation as \"wholesome\"; organizations of the [[United Nations]], such as the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], endorse food irradiation.<ref name=\"JECFI\">World Health Organization.

Activists have also opposed food irradiation for other reasons, for example, arguing that irradiation can be used to sterilize contaminated food without resolving the underlying cause of the contamination.<ref>Hauter, W. & Worth, M., Zapped! Irradiation and the Death of Food, Food & Water Watch Press, Washington, DC, 2008</ref> International legislation on whether food may be irradiated or not varies worldwide from no regulation to a full ban.<ref>[http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif NUCLEUS \u2013 Food Irradiation Clearances<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526025627/http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif |date=26 May 2008 }}</ref> \n\nApproximately 500,000 tons of food items are irradiated per year worldwide in over 40 countries.

PEF holds potential as a type of low-temperature alternative pasteurization process for sterilizing food products. In PEF processing, a substance is placed between two electrodes, then the pulsed electric field is applied. The electric field enlarges the pores of the cell membranes, which kills the cells and releases their contents. PEF for food processing is a developing technology still being researched. There have been limited industrial applications of PEF processing for the pasteurization of fruit juices. To date, several PEF treated juices are available on the market in Europe. Furthermore, for several years a juice pasteurization application in the US has used PEF. For cell disintegration purposes especially potato processors show great interest in PEF technology as an efficient alternative for their preheaters. Potato applications are already operational in the US and Canada. There are also commercial PEF potato applications in various countries in Europe, as well as in Australia, India, and China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elea-technology.com|title=Elea Pulsed Electric Field Technology - Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=www.elea-technology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Modified atmosphere ===\n{{Main|Modified atmosphere}}\n\nModifying atmosphere is a way to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere around it. Salad crops that are notoriously difficult to preserve are now being packaged in sealed bags with an atmosphere modified to reduce the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentration and increase the [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration. There is concern that, although salad vegetables retain their appearance and texture in such conditions, this method of preservation may not retain nutrients, especially [[vitamin]]s.\nThere are two methods for preserving grains with carbon dioxide. One method is placing a block of [[dry ice]] in the bottom and filling the can with the grain. Another method is purging the container from the bottom by gaseous carbon dioxide from a cylinder or bulk supply vessel.\n\n[[Carbon dioxide]] prevents insects and, depending on concentration, [[mold]] and [[oxidation]] from damaging the grain. Grain stored in this way can remain edible for approximately five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://entomology.k-state.edu/doc/finished-chapters/s156-ch-16-contr-or-mod-atmospheres--mar2.pdf|title=Controlled or Modified Atmospheres|last=Navarro|first=Shlomo|last2=Timlick|first2=Blaine|date=March 2012|website=k-state.edu|access-date=17 March 2018|last3=Demianyk|first3=Colin|last4=White|first4=Noel}}</ref>\n\n[[Nitrogen]] gas (N<sub>2</sub>) at concentrations of 98% or higher is also used effectively to kill insects in the grain through [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref>Annis, P.C. and Dowsett, H.A. 1993. Low oxygen disinfestation of grain: exposure periods needed for high mortality. Proc. International Conference on Controlled Atmosphere and Fumigation.

This makes carbon dioxide preferable for fumigation in situations where a [[hermetic seal]] cannot be maintained.\n\nControlled Atmospheric Storage (CA): \"CA storage is a non-chemical process. Oxygen levels in the sealed rooms are reduced, usually by the infusion of nitrogen gas, from the approximate 21 percent in the air we breathe to 1 percent or 2 percent. Temperatures are kept at a constant {{cvt|0\u20132|C|F}}. Humidity is maintained at 95 percent and carbon dioxide levels are also controlled. Exact conditions in the rooms are set according to the apple variety. Researchers develop specific regimens for each variety to achieve the best quality.

The right combination of hurdles can ensure all pathogens are eliminated or rendered harmless in the final product.<ref name=\"Alasalvar\" />\n\nHurdle technology has been defined by Leistner (2000) as an intelligent combination of hurdles that secures the [[microbial]] safety and stability as well as the [[organoleptic]] and nutritional quality and the economic viability of [[food product]]s.<ref>Leistner I (2000) [http://envismadrasuniv.org/Physiology/pdf/Basic%20aspects%20of%20food%20preservation.pdf \"Basic aspects of food preservation by hurdle technology\"] ''International Journal of Food Microbiology'', '''55''':181\u2013186.</ref> The organoleptic quality of the food refers to its sensory properties, that is its look, taste, smell, and texture.\n\nExamples of hurdles in a food system are high temperature during processing, low temperature during storage, increasing the [[acidity]], lowering the [[water activity]] or [[redox potential]], and the presence of [[preservative]]s or [[biopreservative]]s. According to the type of pathogens and how risky they are, the intensity of the hurdles can be adjusted individually to meet consumer preferences in an economical way, without sacrificing the safety of the product.<ref name=\"Alasalvar\">Alasalvar C (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=l-APOWUVp-8C&pg=PT232&dq=%22hurdle+technology%22|%22hurdle+technologies%22&hl=en&ei=5GSFTaTGCJCSuAOj66zGCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22hurdle%20technology%22|%22hurdle%20technologies%22&f=false ''Seafood Quality, Safety and Health Applications''] John Wiley and Sons, Page 203. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-8070-2}}.</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:560px;\"| Principal hurdles used for food preservation (after Leistner, 1995)<ref>Leistner L (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6a_dbGRoiWIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22New+Methods+of+Food+Preservation%22&hl=en&ei=TcOKTbuqDoGougP_95HGDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Principles%20and%20applications%20of%20hurdle%20technology&f=false \"Principles and applications of hurdle technology\"] In Gould GW (Ed.)

This modulation technique is known as [[frequency-shift keying]] (FSK). FSK is widely used in [[modem]]s and [[fax modem]]s, and can also be used to send [[Morse code]].<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = Teach yourself electricity and electronics\n |author = Stan Gibilisco\n |publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n |year = 2002\n |isbn = 978-0-07-137730-0\n |page = 477\n |url = https://books.google.com/?id=-Q6SBAKsmXkC&pg=PA477&dq=morse-code+frequency-shift-keying+sent-using-fsk\n}}</ref> [[Radioteletype]] also uses FSK.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = The Electronics of Radio\n |author = David B.

It is also used in [[telemetry]], [[radar]], seismic prospecting, and monitoring [[newborn]]s for seizures via [[EEG]],<ref>B.

In radio transmission, an advantage of frequency modulation is that it has a larger [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and therefore rejects [[radio frequency interference]] better than an equal power amplitude modulation (AM) signal.  For this reason, most music is broadcast over [[FM radio]].\n\nFrequency modulation and [[phase modulation]] are the two complementary principal methods of [[angle modulation]]; phase modulation is often used as an intermediate step to achieve frequency modulation. These methods contrast with [[amplitude modulation]], in which the [[amplitude]] of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency and phase remain constant.\n\n==Theory==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}\nIf the information to be transmitted (i.e., the [[baseband signal]]) is <math>x_m(t)</math> and the [[sinusoidal]] carrier is <math>x_c(t) = A_c \\cos (2 \\pi f_c t)\\,</math>, where ''f<sub>c</sub>'' is the carrier's base frequency, and ''A<sub>c</sub>'' is the carrier's amplitude, the modulator combines the carrier with the baseband data signal to get the transmitted signal:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \n  y(t) &= A_c \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\int_0^t f(\\tau) d\\tau\\right) \\\\\n       &= A_c \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\int_0^t \\left[f_c + f_\\Delta x_m(\\tau)\\right] d\\tau\\right) \\\\ \n       &= A_c \\cos\\left(2\\pi f_c t + 2\\pi f_\\Delta \\int_0^t x_m(\\tau) d\\tau\\right) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>f_\\Delta = K_f A_m</math>, <math>K_f</math> being the sensitivity of the frequency modulator and <math>A_m</math> being the amplitude of the modulating signal or baseband signal.\n\nIn this equation, <math>f(\\tau)\\,</math> is the ''[[instantaneous phase#Instantaneous frequency|instantaneous frequency]]'' of the oscillator and <math>f_\\Delta\\,</math> is the ''[[frequency deviation]]'', which represents the maximum shift away from ''f<sub>c</sub>'' in one direction, assuming ''x''<sub>''m''</sub>(''t'') is limited to the range \u00b11.\n\nWhile most of the energy of the signal is contained within ''f<sub>c</sub>'' \u00b1 ''f''<sub>\u0394</sub>, it can be shown by [[Fourier analysis]] that a wider range of frequencies is required to precisely represent an FM signal. The [[frequency spectrum]] of an actual FM signal has components extending infinitely, although their amplitude decreases and higher-order components are often neglected in practical design problems.<ref name=TGTSCS05/>\n\n===Sinusoidal baseband signal===\nMathematically, a baseband modulating signal may be approximated by a [[sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[continuous wave]] signal with a frequency ''f<sub>m</sub>''. This method is also named as single-tone modulation. The integral of such a signal is:\n\n:<math>\\int_0^t x_m(\\tau)d\\tau = A_m \\frac{\\sin\\left(2\\pi f_m t\\right)}{2\\pi f_m}\\,</math>\n\nIn this case, the expression for y(t) above simplifies to:\n\n:<math>y(t) = A_c \\cos\\left(2\\pi f_c t + \\frac{A_m f_\\Delta}{f_m} \\sin\\left(2\\pi f_m t\\right)\\right)\\,</math>\n\nwhere the amplitude <math>A_m\\,</math> of the modulating [[sine wave|sinusoid]] is represented by the peak deviation <math>f_\\Delta\\,</math> (see [[frequency deviation]]).\n\nThe [[harmonic]] distribution of a [[sine wave]] carrier modulated by such a [[sinusoidal]] signal can be represented with [[Bessel function]]s; this provides the basis for a mathematical understanding of frequency modulation in the frequency domain.\n\n===Modulation index===\nAs in other modulation systems, the modulation index indicates by how much the modulated variable varies around its unmodulated level. It relates to variations in the [[carrier frequency]]:\n\n:<math>h = \\frac{\\Delta{}f}{f_m} = \\frac{f_\\Delta \\left|x_m(t)\\right|}{f_m}</math>\n\nwhere <math>f_m\\,</math> is the highest frequency component present in the modulating signal ''x''<sub>''m''</sub>(''t''), and <math>\\Delta{}f\\,</math> is the peak frequency-deviation\u2014i.e. the maximum deviation of the ''[[instantaneous phase#Instantaneous frequency|instantaneous frequency]]'' from the carrier frequency. For a sine wave modulation, the modulation index is seen to be the ratio of the peak frequency deviation of the carrier wave to the frequency of the modulating sine wave.\n\nIf <math>h \\ll 1</math>, the modulation is called '''narrowband FM''' (NFM), and its bandwidth is approximately <math>2f_m\\,</math>. Sometimes modulation index <math>h < 0.3</math>&nbsp;radians is considered as NFM, otherwise wideband FM (WFM or FM).\n\nFor digital modulation systems, for example binary frequency shift keying (BFSK), where a binary signal modulates the carrier, the modulation index is given by:\n\n:<math>h = \\frac{\\Delta{}f}{f_m} = \\frac{\\Delta{}f}{\\frac{1}{2T_s}} = 2\\Delta{}fT_s \\ </math>\n\nwhere <math>T_s\\,</math> is the symbol period, and <math>f_m = \\frac{1}{2T_s}\\,</math> is used as the highest frequency of the modulating binary waveform by convention, even though it would be more accurate to say it is the highest ''fundamental'' of the modulating binary waveform. In the case of digital modulation, the carrier <math>f_c\\,</math> is never transmitted. Rather, one of two frequencies is transmitted, either <math>f_c + \\Delta{}f</math> or <math>f_c - \\Delta{}f</math>, depending on the binary state 0 or 1 of the modulation signal.\n\nIf <math>h \\gg 1</math>, the modulation is called ''wideband FM'' and its bandwidth is approximately <math>2f_\\Delta\\,</math>. While wideband FM uses more bandwidth, it can improve the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] significantly; for example, doubling the value of <math>\\Delta{}f\\,</math>, while keeping <math>f_m</math> constant, results in an eight-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio.<ref>Der, Lawrence, Ph.D., ''Frequency Modulation (FM) Tutorial'', http://www.silabs.com/Marcom%20Documents/Resources/FMTutorial.pdf, Silicon Laboratories, Inc., accessed 2013 February 24, p. 5</ref> (Compare this with [[chirp spread spectrum]], which uses extremely wide frequency deviations to achieve processing gains comparable to traditional, better-known spread-spectrum modes).\n\nWith a tone-modulated FM&nbsp;wave, if the modulation frequency is held constant and the modulation index is increased, the (non-negligible) bandwidth of the FM signal increases but the spacing between spectra remains the same; some spectral components decrease in strength as others increase. If the frequency deviation is held constant and the modulation frequency increased, the spacing between spectra increases.\n\n{{anchor|narrowband FM}}\nFrequency modulation can be classified as narrowband if the change in the carrier frequency is about the same as the signal frequency, or as wideband if the change in the carrier frequency is much higher (modulation index&nbsp;>&nbsp;1) than the signal frequency.<ref>Lathi, B. P. (1968). ''Communication Systems'', p.&nbsp;214\u2013217. New York: John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-51832-8}}.</ref> For example, narrowband FM (NFM) is used for [[two-way radio]] systems such as [[Family Radio Service]], in which the carrier is allowed to deviate only 2.5&nbsp;kHz above and below the center frequency with speech signals of no more than 3.5&nbsp;kHz bandwidth. Wideband FM is used for [[FM broadcasting]], in which music and speech are transmitted with up to 75&nbsp;kHz deviation from the center frequency and carry audio with up to a 20&nbsp;kHz bandwidth and subcarriers up to 92&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Bessel functions===\n[[File:Waterfall FM.jpg|thumb|Frequency spectrum and [[waterfall plot]] of a 146.52{{nbsp}}MHz carrier, frequency modulated by a 1,000{{nbsp}}Hz sinusoid.  The modulation index has been adjusted to around 2.4, so the carrier frequency has small amplitude. Several strong sidebands are apparent; in principle an infinite number are produced in FM but the higher-order sidebands are of negligible magnitude.]]\n\nFor the case of a carrier modulated by a single sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum can be calculated using [[Bessel function]]s of the first kind, as a function of the [[sideband]] number and the modulation index. The carrier and sideband amplitudes are illustrated for different modulation indices of FM signals. For particular values of the modulation index, the carrier amplitude becomes zero and all the signal power is in the sidebands.<ref name=TGTSCS05>T.G. Thomas, S. C. Sekhar  ''Communication Theory'', Tata-McGraw Hill 2005, {{ISBN|0-07-059091-5}}  page 136</ref>\n\nSince the sidebands are on both sides of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the modulating frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3&nbsp;kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2&nbsp;kHz audio tone produces a modulation index of 1.36. Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those sidebands that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this modulation index will produce three sidebands. These three sidebands, when doubled, gives us (6 \u00d7 2.2&nbsp;kHz) or a 13.2&nbsp;kHz required bandwidth.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Modulation<br />index\n! colspan=17 | Sideband amplitude\n|-\n!

The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5\u201315&nbsp;dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reference Data for Radio Engineers |edition=Fifth |page=21-11 |year=1970 |publisher=Howard W.

This is used to modulate a [[crystal oscillator|crystal-controlled oscillator]], and the result is passed through a [[frequency multiplier]] to produce an FM signal. In this modulation, narrowband FM is generated leading to wideband FM later and hence the modulation is known as indirect FM modulation.<ref>Haykin, Simon [Ed]. (2001). ''Communication Systems'', 4th&nbsp;ed.</ref>\n\n===Demodulation===\n{{See also|Detector (radio)#Frequency and phase modulation detectors|l1=Detectors}}\nMany FM detector circuits exist. A common method for recovering the information signal is through a [[Foster-Seeley discriminator]] or [[ratio detector]]. A [[phase-locked loop]] can be used as an FM demodulator. ''Slope detection'' demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. As the frequency rises and falls the tuned circuit provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of [[detector (radio)|detection]] for FM broadcasts.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Magnetic tape storage===\nFM is also used at [[Intermediate frequency|intermediate frequencies]] by analog [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]] systems (including [[VHS]]) to record the [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the [[chrominance]] component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as [[Tape bias|bias]]. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance (\"black and white\") component of video to (and retrieving video from) [[magnetic tape]] without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components \u2013 from a few [[hertz]] to several [[megahertz]], too wide for [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]] to work with due to electronic noise below \u221260&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting as a form of [[noise reduction]]; a [[audio level compression|limiter]] can mask variations in playback output, and the [[FM capture]] effect removes [[print-through]] and [[pre-echo]]. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal \u2013 as was done on [[V2000]] and many Hi-band formats \u2013 can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist [[timebase correction]].\n\nThese FM systems are unusual, in that they have a ratio of carrier to maximum modulation frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by [[Bessel function|Bessel]] analysis, the first sidebands are on 9.5 and 2.5&nbsp;MHz and the second sidebands are on 13&nbsp;MHz and \u22121&nbsp;MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1&nbsp;MHz; on demodulation, this results in unwanted output at 6 \u2013 1 = 5&nbsp;MHz. The system must be designed so that this unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.<ref>: \"FM Systems Of Exceptional Bandwidth\" Proc. IEEE vol 112, no. 9, p. 1664, September 1965</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nFM is also used at [[audio frequency|audio frequencies]] to synthesize sound. This technique, known as [[frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]], was popularized by early digital [[synthesizer]]s and became a standard feature in several generations of [[personal computer]] [[sound card]]s.\n\n===Radio===\n[[File:FM Broadcast Transmitter High Power.jpg|200px|thumb|An American FM radio transmitter in Buffalo, NY at WEDG]]\n{{Main article|FM broadcasting}}\n[[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] (1890\u20131954) was an American electrical engineer who invented wideband frequency modulation (FM) radio.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = Principles of modern communications technology\n |author = A.

The paper was published in 1936.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |first = E.

Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM was chosen as the modulation standard for high frequency, [[high fidelity]] [[radio]] transmission, hence the term \"[[FM radio]]\" (although for many years the [[BBC]] called it \"VHF radio\" because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the [[VHF]] band\u2014the [[FM broadcast band]]). FM [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] employ a special [[Detector (radio)|detector]] for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the ''[[capture effect]]'', in which the [[Tuner (radio)|tuner]] \"captures\" the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, [[frequency drift]] or a lack of [[Electronic selectivity|selectivity]] may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an [[adjacent channel]]. Frequency [[drift (telecommunication)|drift]] was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.\n\nAn FM signal can also be used to carry a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] signal; this is done with [[multiplexing]] and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes. A high-efficiency radio-frequency [[switching amplifier]] can be used to transmit FM signals (and other [[constant envelope|constant-amplitude signals]]). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use [[low-power electronics|less battery power]] and typically cost less than a [[linear amplifier]]. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]].\n\nFM is commonly used at [[VHF]] [[radio frequencies]] for [[high-fidelity]] [[radio broadcasting|broadcasts]] of music and [[Speech communication|speech]]. Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM. Narrowband FM is used for voice communications in commercial and [[amateur radio]] settings. In broadcast services, where audio fidelity is important, wideband FM is generally used. In [[two-way radio]], narrowband FM (NBFM) is used to conserve bandwidth for land mobile, marine mobile and other radio services.\n\nThere are reports that on October 5, 1924, Professor [[Mikhail A. Bonch-Bruevich]], during a scientific and technical conversation in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Radio Laboratory]], reported about his new method of telephony, based on a change in the period of oscillations. Demonstration of frequency modulation was carried out on the laboratory model.<ref>\u0424. \u041b\u0431\u043e\u0432.

[[Rationality]] is based on [[reason]] or [[facts]]. [[Faith]] is belief in [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]], [[revelation]], or [[authority]]. The word ''faith'' sometimes refers to a belief that is held with lack of reason or evidence, a belief that is held in spite of or against [[reason]] or [[evidence]], or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.\n\nAlthough the words ''faith'' and ''belief'' are sometimes erroneously conflated{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and used as synonyms, ''faith'' properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of ''belief,'' as defined above.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two categories of views regarding the relationship between faith and rationality:\n#[[Rationalism]] holds that [[truth]] should be determined by [[reason]] and factual analysis, rather than faith, [[dogma]], tradition or religious teaching.\n#[[Fideism]] holds that faith is necessary, and that beliefs may be held without any evidence or reason and even in conflict with evidence and reason.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] also has taught that true [[faith]] and correct [[reason]] can and must work together, and, viewed properly, can never be in conflict with one another, as both have their origin in God, as stated in the [[Papal encyclical]] letter issued by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]], ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (\"[On] Faith and Reason\").\n\n==Relationship between faith and reason==\nFrom at least the days of the Greek Philosophers, the relationship between faith and reason has been hotly debated. [[Plato]] argued that knowledge is simply memory of the eternal. [[Aristotle]] set down rules by which knowledge could be discovered by reason.\n\nRationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs \u2014 irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce. Or, according to [[Pascal's Wager]], it may be to our advantage to have faith, because faith may promise infinite rewards, while the rewards of reason are seen by many as finite. One more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by [[B. F. Skinner]] in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour.  The result was that each of pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.<ref name=Skinner>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B.

Rationalists contend that this is arrived at because they have observed the world being consistent and sensible, not because they have faith that it is.\n\nBeliefs held \"by faith\" may be seen existing in a number of relationships to rationality:\n* '''Faith as underlying rationality''': In this view, all human [[knowledge]] and reason is seen as dependent on [[faith]]: faith in our senses, faith in our [[reason]], faith in our [[Memory|memories]], and faith in the accounts of events we receive from others. Accordingly, faith is seen as essential to and inseparable from rationality. According to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], rationality is built first upon the realization of the absolute truth \"[[Cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I am]]\", which requires no faith. All other rationalizations are built outward from this realization, and are subject to [[Falsifiability|falsification]] at any time with the arrival of new evidence.\n* '''Faith as addressing issues beyond the scope of rationality''': In this view, faith is seen as covering issues that science and rationality are inherently incapable of addressing, but that are nevertheless entirely real. Accordingly, faith is seen as complementing rationality, by providing answers to questions that would otherwise be unanswerable.\n* '''Faith as contradicting rationality''': In this view, faith is seen as those views that one holds despite evidence and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith is seen as pernicious with respect to rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality is seen as the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.\n* '''Faith and reason as essential together''': This is the Catholic view that faith without reason leads to [[superstition]], while [[reason]] without [[faith]] leads to [[nihilism]] and [[relativism]].\n* '''Faith as based on warrant''': In this view some degree of evidence provides warrant for faith. \"To explain great things by small.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawker|first=Robert|title=Poor Man's Commentary|year=1805|pages=Hebrews 11}}</ref>\n\n==Views of the Roman Catholic Church==\n[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], the most important [[Doctor of the Church#Catholicism|doctor of the Catholic Church]], was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith\u2014an intellectual assent<ref>\"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm Faith]\" from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\u2014and reason,<ref>\"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12673b.htm Reason]\" from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''</ref> predominately in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', ''[[De Veritate (Thomas Aquinas)|De Veritate]]'', and ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.<ref>For an overview\u2014with copious quotes from [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s works, some of which are quoted here\u2014of his exposition of the topic of faith and reason, consult [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323175836/http://www.truthinspire.com/reason-and-faith/ truthinspire.com].</ref>\n\nThe [[Council of Trent]]'s [[catechism]]\u2014the ''[[Roman Catechism]]'', written during the Catholic Church's [[Counter-Reformation]] to combat [[Protestantism]] and [[Martin Luther]]'s antimetaphysical tendencies.<ref>[http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BeckerFaith.pdf Faith and Reason in Martin Luther]</ref><ref>On the differences between [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s conception of faith and reason and that of [[Martin Luther]].{{cite journal |journal=''The Thomist'' |title=Faith and Reason Reconsidered: Aquinas and Luther on Deciding What is True |author=Bruce D.

It deals with the relationship between faith and reason.\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 12 September 2006 [[Regensburg Lecture]] was about faith and reason.\n\n==Lutheran epistemology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nSome have asserted that [[Martin Luther]] taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason.  Contemporary Lutheran scholarship however has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each understand. Bernhard Lohse for example has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides Und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently [[Hans-Peter Gro\u00dfhans]] has demonstrated that Luther's work on Bibilical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible be reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible make sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than Reason which for Luther denoted science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a differing picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.\n\n==Reformed epistemology==\n\n===Faith as underlying rationality===\nThe view that faith underlies all rationality holds that rationality is dependent on faith for its coherence. Under this view, there is no way to comprehensively ''prove'' that we are actually seeing what we appear to be seeing, that what we remember actually happened, or that the laws of logic and mathematics are actually real. Instead, all beliefs depend for their coherence on ''faith'' in our senses, memory, and reason, because the foundations of rationalism cannot be proven by evidence or reason. Rationally, you can not prove anything you see is real, but you can prove that you yourself are real, and rationalist belief would be that you can believe that the world is consistent until something demonstrates inconsistency. This differs from faith based belief, where you believe that your world view is consistent no matter what inconsistencies the world has with your beliefs.\n\n===Rationalist point of view===\nIn this view, there are many beliefs that are held by faith alone, that rational thought would force the mind to reject. As an example, many people believe in the Biblical story of Noah's flood: that the entire Earth was covered by water for forty days. But objected that most plants cannot survive being covered by water for that length of time, a boat of that magnitude could not have been built by wood, and there would be no way for two of every animal to survive on that ship and migrate back to their place of origin. (such as penguins), Although Christian apologists offer answers to these and such issues,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ham|first=Ken|title=Was There Really a Noah's Ark & Flood?|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab/really-a-flood-and-ark|work=Answers in Genesis|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=David|title=How Did Plants Survive the Flood?|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/aid/v7/n1/how-did-plants-survive-flood|work=Answers in Genesis|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How did animals get from the Ark to isolated places..|url=http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html|work=Christian Answers Network|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> under the premise that such responses are insufficient, then one must choose between accepting the story on faith and rejecting reason, or rejecting the story by reason and thus rejecting faith.\n\nWithin the rationalist point of view, there remains the possibility of multiple rational explanations.  For example, considering the biblical story of Noah's flood, one making rational determinations about the probability of the events does so via interpretation of modern evidence.  Two observers of the story may provide different plausible explanations for the life of plants, construction of the boat, species living at the time, and migration following the flood.  Some see this as meaning that a person is not strictly bound to choose between faith and reason.\n\n==Evangelical views==\nAmerican biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]]  stated that the Greek word ''pistis''  used for faith in the New Testament  (over two hundred forty times), and  rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is \"an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Archibald Thomas|title=WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages=Chapter 17|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}</ref>  Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that  when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Price|first=Thomas|title=Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url=http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to faith meaning  blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, [[Alister McGrath]] quotes  Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas, (1861-1924),  who states faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\"  and \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...\", which McGrath sees as  \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title=The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=140512556X|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n[[Alvin Plantinga]] upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this,  he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe.  \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit.

He wrote, \"The Torah cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe.\"<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia, volume VIII, page 29</ref>  His contemporary [[Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas]] argued the contrary view, that reason is weak and faith strong, and that only through faith can we discover the fundamental truth that God is love, that through faith alone can we endure the suffering that is the common lot of God's chosen people.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Christian apologetics]]\n** [[Evidential apologetics]]\n** [[Christian existential apologetics|Existential apologetics]]\n** [[Presuppositional apologetics]]\n* [[Dehellenization]]\n* [[Enlightenment (spiritual)]]\n* [[Essence-energies distinction]]\n* [[Faith and Philosophy]]\n* [[Fideism]]\n* [[Methods of obtaining knowledge]]\n* [[Natural theology]]\n* [[Non-overlapping magisteria]]\n* [[Panrationalism]]\n* [[Philosophy of religion]]\n* [[Reformed epistemology]]\n* [[Relationship between religion and science]]\n* [[Religious epistemology]]\n* [[Religious experience]]\n* [[Theory of everything (philosophy)]]\n* [[Theory of justification]]\n* [[William Alston]]\n* [[Richard Dawkins]]\n* [[Asa Gray]]\n* [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]\n* [[Alvin Plantinga]]\n* [[Leo Strauss]]\n* [[Cornelius Van Til]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n===Apologetics and philosophical justifications of faith as rational===\n* ''[http://www.faithandreason.org/ FaithandReason.org]''&mdash;nondenominational website advocating that faith and reason can work together (D.L.

(These directions are also known as [[orthodromic]] and [[antidromic]], respectively.) When the ''orthodromic'' stimulus reaches the muscle fiber, it elicits a strong [[M-response]] indicative of [[muscle contraction]]. When the ''antidromic'' stimulus reaches the motor neuron [[cell body|cell bodies]], a small portion of the motor neurons backfire and orthodromic wave travels back down the nerve towards the muscle. This reflected stimulus evokes small proportion of the muscle fibers causing a small, second [[Compound muscle action potential|CMAP]] called the F wave.\n\nBecause a different population of anterior horn cells is stimulated with each stimulation, each F wave have a slightly different shape, amplitude and latency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== Properties ==\nF wave properties include:\n\n* ''amplitude'' ([[volt|&micro;V]]) - F wave height\n* ''duration'' ([[millisecond|ms]]) - length of F wave\n* ''latency'' (ms) - period between F wave and initial stimulation\n\n== F wave measurements==\nSeveral measurements can be done on the F responses, including minimal and maximal latencies, and F wave persistence.\n\nThe minimal F wave latency is typically 25-32 ms in the upper extremities, and 45-56 ms in the lower extremities.\n\nF wave persistence is the number of F waves obtained per the number of stimulations, which is normally 80-100% (or above 50%).\n\n==See also==\n* [[H reflex]]\n* [[Electromyography]] (EMG)\n\n== References ==\n* Fisher, M.A. AAEM Minimonograph #13: H reflexes and F waves: physiology and indications.

It is the first of five months to have a length of less than 31 days (the other four months that fall under this category are: April, June, September, and November), and the only month to have a length of less than 30 days, as the other eleven months have a length of at least 30 days. This year February {{if|expr|{{CURRENTMONTHNUMBER}}<3|has|had|will have}} {{#ifeq:{{leapyear}}|1|29|28}} days in it.\n\nFebruary is the third month of [[meteorological winter]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

This comes about by analogy with \"January\" ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-January.ogg|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u00e6|nj|u|\u025br|i}}), as well as by a [[dissimilation]] effect whereby having two \"r\"s close to each other causes one to change for ease of pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/february |title=February &#124; Definition of February by Merriam-Webster |website=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry f\u00e9vrier.jpg|thumb|February, from the ''[[Tr\u00e8s riches heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]\n[[File:Februar Leandro Bassano.jpg|thumb|''February'', [[Leandro Bassano]]]]\n[[File:Valentines Day Chocolates from 2005.jpg|thumb|Chocolates for [[St. Valentine's Day]]]]\nThe Roman month ''[[Februarius]]'' was named after the Latin term ''februum'', which means ''purification'', via the purification ritual ''[[Februa]]'' held on February 15 (full moon) in the old lunar [[Roman calendar]].  January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar, since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period.  They were added by [[Numa Pompilius]] about 713 BC.  February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the [[decemvirs]] (c. 450&nbsp;BC), when it became the second month. At certain intervals February was truncated to 23 or 24 days, and a 27-day intercalary month, [[Mercedonius|Intercalaris]], was inserted immediately after February to realign the year with the [[season]]s.\n\nFebruary observances in [[Ancient Rome]] include [[Amburbium]] (precise date unknown), [[Sementivae]] (February 2), [[Februa]] (February 13\u201315), [[Lupercalia]] (February 13\u201315), [[Parentalia]] (February 13\u201322), [[Quirinus|Quirinalia]] (February 17), [[Feralia]] (February 21), [[Caristia]] (February 22), [[Terminalia]] (February 23), [[Regifugium]] (February 24), and [[Agonalia#Agonium Martiale|Agonium Martiale]] (February 27). These days do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nUnder the reforms that instituted the [[Julian calendar]], Intercalaris was abolished, leap years occurred regularly every fourth year, and in leap years February gained a 29th day.  Thereafter, it remained the second month of the calendar year, meaning the order that months are displayed (January, February, March,&nbsp;..., December) within a year-at-a-glance calendar.  Even during the Middle Ages, when the numbered [[Anno Domini]] year began on March 25 or December 25, the second month was February whenever all twelve months were displayed in order. The [[Gregorian calendar]] reforms made slight changes to the system for determining which years were leap years and thus contained a 29-day February.\n\nHistorical names for February include the [[Old English language|Old English]] terms Solmonath (mud month) and Kale-monath (named for [[cabbage]]) as well as [[Charlemagne]]'s designation Hornung. In Finnish, the month is called ''helmikuu'', meaning \"month of the pearl\"; when snow melts on tree branches, it forms droplets, and as these freeze again, they are like pearls of ice. In [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], respectively, the month is called ''luty'' or ''\u043b\u044e\u0442\u0438\u0439'', meaning the month of ice or hard frost. In [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] the month is ''sechko'' (\u0441\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e), meaning month of cutting [wood]. In Czech, it is called ''\u00fanor'', meaning month of submerging [of river ice].\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], February is traditionally called ''sve\u010dan'', related to [[icicle]]s or [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Candlemas]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |format=PDF |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}</ref> This name originates from ''si\u010dan'',<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.si/books?id=0V9gAAAAMAAJ|title=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr slavische Philologie|publisher=Markert&Petters|year=1972|editor-first=Max|editor-last=Vasmer|page=115|volume=36\u201337}}</ref> written as ''svi\u010dan'' in the ''New Carniolan Almanac'' from 1775 and changed to its final form by [[Franc Metelko]] in his ''New Almanac'' from 1824.

The idea was proposed by a priest, Bla\u017e Poto\u010dnik.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:doc-ACZAUJWT/?&language=eng|journal=Kmetijske in rokodelske novice|title=Slovenska imena mesecev |trans-title=Slovene Names of Months|volume=6|issue=37|date=13 September 1848}}</ref> Another name of February in Slovene was ''vesnar'', after the mythological character [[Vesna]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.posta.si/downloadfile.aspx?fileid=14263|title=Slovenska mitologija \u2013 Vesna|language=Slovenian, English, German|trans-title=Slovene Mythology \u2013 Vesna|journal=Bilten; po\u0161tne znamke [Bulletin: Postage Stamps]|issue=56|year=2005|issn=1318-6280|first=Janez|last=Bogataj}}</ref>\n\n==Patterns==\nHaving only 28 days in common years, February is the only month of the year that can pass without a single [[full moon]].

In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a [[common year starting on Friday]], in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday; this occurred in 1965, 1971, 1982, 1993, 1999 and 2010, and occur will again in 2021. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a [[common year starting on Thursday]], with the next occurrence in 2026, and previous occurrences in 1987, 1998, 2009 and 2015. The pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.\n\n==Astronomy==\nFebruary [[meteor showers]] include the [[Alpha Centaurids]] (appearing in early February), the [[Virginids#March Virginids|Beta Leonids]], also known as the March Virginids (lasting from February 14 to April 25, peaking around March 20), the [[Delta Cancrids]] (appearing December 14 to February 14, peaking on January 17), the [[Omicron Centaurids]] (late January through February, peaking in mid-February), [[Theta Centaurids]] (January 23 \u2013 March 12, only visible in the southern hemisphere), [[Virginids#Eta Virginids|Eta Virginids]] (February 24 and March 27, peaking around March 18), and [[Virginids#Pi Virginid|Pi Virginids]] (February 13 and April 8, peaking between March 3 and March 9).\n\n==Astrology==\nThe western zodiac signs of February are [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] (until February 19) and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] (February 20 onwards).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mistupid.com/zodiac/ |title=Zodiac Signs |website=Mistupid.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==February symbols==\n[[File:1760 - Salzburg - Stiftskirche St Peter - Viola.JPG|thumb|150px|The [[Viola (plant)|violet]]]]\n*Its birth flowers are the violet (''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'') the common primrose (''[[Primula vulgaris]]''), <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babiesonline.com/flowersbirthmonth/ |title=Birth Month Flowers |website=Babiesonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}</ref> and the [[Iris (plant)|Iris]].<ref>https://www.1stinflowers.com/fom_february.html</ref>\n*[[File:Am\u00e9thystre sceptre2.jpg|alt=Amethyst crystals|thumb|Amethyst crystals]]Its birthstone is the [[amethyst]].

Although the First Lady's role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the nation.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |last1=Caroli|first1=Betty Boyd|title=First Lady: United States title|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/first-lady-United-States-title|website=Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref>  Since the early 20th century, the First Lady has been assisted by official staff, now known as the [[Office of the First Lady]] and headquartered in the [[East Wing]] of the [[White House]].  [[Melania Trump]] is the current First Lady of the United States, and wife of 45th President of the United States, [[Donald  Trump]]. \n\nWhile the title was not in general use until much later, [[Martha Washington]], the wife of [[George Washington]], the first U.S. President (1789\u20131797), is considered to be the inaugural First Lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Figueroa|first=Acton|title=Washington,|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SbH-nF2QcYC&pg=PA10|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=World Almanac Library|isbn=978-0-8368-5162-5|page=10}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1790s, the role of First Lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. Because first ladies now typically publish their memoirs, which are viewed as potential sources of additional information about their husbands\u2019 administrations, and because the public is interested in these increasingly independent women in their own right, first ladies frequently remain a focus of attention long after their husbands\u2019 terms of office have ended.<ref name=Britannica/> Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy. Historically, should a president be unmarried, or a widower, the president usually asks a relative or friend to act as White House hostess.\n\nThere are four living former first ladies: [[Rosalynn Carter]], wife of [[Jimmy Carter]]; [[Hillary Clinton]], wife of [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Laura Bush]], wife of [[George W. Bush]]; and [[Michelle Obama]], wife of [[Barack Obama]]. As of 2018, the only former First Lady who has run for or held public office is [[Hillary Clinton]].\n\n== Origins of the title ==\n[[File:Dolley Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dolley Madison]] was said to be the first President's wife to be referred to as \"First Lady\" (this was at her funeral in 1849).]]\n\nThe use of the title ''[[First Lady]]'' to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as \"Lady\", \"Mrs. President\" and \"Mrs. Presidentress\"; [[Martha Washington]] was often referred to as \"Lady Washington.\"  One of the earliest uses of the term \"First Lady\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the ''St. Johnsbury Caledonian'', the author, \"Mrs. Sigourney\", discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president.  She wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Martha Washington |work=St. Johnsbury Caledonian |date=August 7, 1838 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[Dolley Madison]] was reportedly referred to as \"First Lady\" in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President [[Zachary Taylor]]; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=4 |title=First Lady Biography: Dolley Madison |publisher=National First Ladies' Library}}</ref> Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. One of the earliest known written examples comes from November 3, 1863, diary entry of [[William Howard Russell]], in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist [[Mary C. Ames]] referred to [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] as \"the First Lady of the Land\" while reporting on the inauguration of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled ''The First Lady in the Land'', popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.\n\nWhen [[Edith Wilson]] took control of her husband's schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her \"the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Sharon |last=Creeden |title=In Full Bloom: Tales of Women in Their Prime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2DyOCFDrcwC&pg=PA30 |year=1999 |publisher=August House |page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe wife of the [[Vice President of the United States]] is sometimes referred to as the [[Second Lady of the United States]] ('''SLOTUS'''), but this title is much less common.\n\n=== Non-spouses in the role ===\nSeveral women (at least thirteen) who were not presidents' wives have served as First Lady, as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when the wife of the president was unable to fulfill the duties of the First Lady herself. In these cases, the position has been filled by a female relative or friend of the president, such as [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's]] daughter [[Martha Jefferson Randolph]], [[Andrew Jackson#Presidency 1829\u20131837|Jackson's]] daughter-in-law [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]] and his wife's niece [[Emily Donelson]], [[Zachary Taylor|Taylor]]'s daughter [[Mary Elizabeth Bliss]], [[Benjamin Harrison]]'s daughter [[Mary Harrison McKee]], [[James Buchanan#Presidency 1857\u20131861|Buchanan's]] niece [[Harriet Lane]], and [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland's]] sister [[Rose Cleveland]].\n\n== Role ==\n[[File:Mrs. Bush and Missouri Governor John Ashcroft attend a \"Parents as Teachers\" parent-child group at the... - NARA - 186437.tif|thumb|right|First Lady [[Barbara Bush]], joined by Missouri Governor [[John Ashcroft]], with a \"Parents as Teachers\" group at the [[Greater St. Louis]] [[Ferguson-Florissant School District]] in October 1991.

She is, first and foremost, the hostess of the White House.<ref name=\"role\"/> She organizes and attends official ceremonies and functions of state either along with, or in place of, the president. Lisa Burns identifies four successive main themes of the first ladyship: as public woman (1900\u20131929); as political celebrity (1932\u20131961); as political activist (1964\u20131977); and as political interloper (1980\u20132001).<ref>{{cite book |first=Lisa M. |last=Burns |title=First Ladies and the Fourth Estate: Press Framing of Presidential Wives |year=2008 |location=DeKalb, IL |publisher=Northern Illinois University Press |isbn=978-0875803913}}</ref>\n\nMartha Washington created the role and hosted many affairs of state at the national capital (New York and Philadelphia).

He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to ''Dune''.\n\n''Dune'' took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science fiction of the time was supposed to be.

In 1974, Beverly underwent an operation for cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the surgery.<ref>Herbert, Frank P. (1987), ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', New York City: The Berkley Publishing Group, [[Ace Books]], pg. 436, {{ISBN|0-441-10267-0}}. \"It was typical of her that she wanted me to call the radiologist whose treatment in 1974 was the proximate cause of her death and thank him...\"</ref> During this period, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California, in October 1978. In 1979, he met anthropologist James Funaro with whom he conceived the [[Contact Conference]]. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' was published; in his afterword to 1985's ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.\n\nIn 1983, British [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' after ''Dune'', but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song \"To Tame a Land\".\n\n1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of [[David Lynch]]'s film version of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States.

It points in relativistic directions. It says that we have the imagination for these other opportunities, these other choices. We tend to tie ourselves down to limited choices. We say, \"Well, the only answer is&nbsp;...\" or, \"If you would just&nbsp;...\". Whatever follows these two statements narrows the choices right there. It gets the vision right down close to the ground so that you don't see anything happening outside. Humans tend not to see over a long range. Now we are required, in these generations, to have a longer range view of what we inflict on the world around us. This is where, I think, science fiction is helping. I don't think that the mere writing of such a book as ''[[Brave New World]]'' or ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' prevents those things which are portrayed in those books from happening. But I do think they alert us to that possibility and make that possibility less likely. They make us aware that we may be going in that direction.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} | author=Frank Herbert}}\n\nFrank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex<ref>\"With its blend (or sometimes clash) of complex intellectual discourse and Byzantine intrigue, ''Dune'' provided a template for FH's more significant later works.

Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.{{sfn|Conley|Cain|2006|pages=\"Foreword\", p. XIX ff}}\n\nSome of these languages, e.g., in worlds of [[fantasy fiction]], [[alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]]s, Earth's future, or [[alternate history]], are presented as distorted versions or [[dialect]]s of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed [[conlang]]s.\n\nWhile most fictional languages are just [[gibberish]], a few are fully functioning and comprehensive languages that can be learned.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.britannica.com/list/6-fictional-languages-you-can-really-learn |title=6 Fictional Languages You Can Really Learn |first1=Alison |last1=Eldridge |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=September 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nFictional languages are separated from artistic languages by both purpose and relative completion: a fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] (two Elvish languages), ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Klingon language]] and [[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']]'s [[Na'vi language]] which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here \"fictional\" can be a [[misnomer]].\n\nBy analogy with the word \"conlang,\" the term ''[[conworld]]'' is used to describe these fictional worlds, inhabited by fictional [[constructed culture]]s. The conworld influences vocabulary (what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, objects of technology, religious concepts, names of places and tribes, etc.), as well as influencing other factors such as pronouns, or how their cultures view the break-off points between colors or the gender and age of family members.\n\n==Professional fictional languages==\n'''Professional fictional languages''' are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and musical albums (prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the Middle-Earth and ''Star Trek'' universes and the game ''[[Myst]]'').\n\n===Alien languages===\n[[Image:Qapla'.svg|thumb|right|''Qapla''', \"success\" in the [[Klingon Language]]]]\n{{main|Alien language}}\nA notable subgenre of fictional languages are [[alien language]]s, the ones that are used or might be used by putative [[extraterrestrial life]] forms. Alien languages are subject of both [[science fiction]] and scientific research.\n\nPerhaps the most fully developed fictional alien language is the Klingon language of the ''Star Trek'' universe - a fully developed [[constructed language]].\n\nThe problem of alien language has confronted generations of [[science fiction]] writers; some have created fictional languages for their characters to use, while others have circumvented the problem through translation devices or other fantastic technology.\n\nAlthough this field remains largely confined to science fiction, the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life makes the question of alien language a credible topic for [[science|scientific]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] speculation.\n\nWhile in many cases an alien language is but an element of a fictional reality, in a number of science fiction works the core of the plot involves linguistic and psychological problems of communication between various alien species.\n\n==Internet-based fictional languages==\n'''Internet-based fictional languages''' are hosted along with their \"conworlds\" on the internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites; [[Verdurian]], the language of [[Mark Rosenfelder]]'s Verduria on the planet of Almea, is a flagship Internet-based fictional language. Many other fictional languages and their associated conworlds are created privately by their inventor, known only to the inventor and perhaps a few friends.

In the early 1990s other teams followed suit and [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic gearboxes]] and [[traction control system|traction control]] were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for {{F1|1994}}.

This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. There were to be four grooves on the front (three in the first year) and rear that ran through the entire circumference of the tyre. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller [[contact patch]] between tyre and track.

The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\n\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from {{F1|1984}} to {{F1|2008}}. The teams won every Constructors' Championship from {{F1|1979}} to {{F1|2008}} as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix]]) between 1988 and 1997. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically. This increased financial burdens, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive, but to stay in business, and forced several teams to withdraw. Since {{F1|1990}}, twenty-eight teams have withdrawn from Formula One.

This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance within the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become [[Brawn GP]] with the notable F1 designer [[Ross Brawn]] and [[Nick Fry]] running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP went through a painful size reduction, laying off hundreds of employees, but eventually won the year's world championships with [[Jenson Button]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]]. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, [[Peter Sauber]]. The [[Lotus F1 Team]]<ref>This is not the same team as the [[Team Lotus|1954\u201394]] nor [[Team Lotus (2010\u201311)|2010\u201311]] iterations.</ref> were another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] team by [[Genii Capital]] investors.

Hence, during the 2010 season, [[Mercedes Benz]] re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after its purchase of [[Brawn GP]], and split with [[McLaren]] after 15 seasons with the team.

They were also joined by the [[US F1 Team]], which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European based team in the sport.

Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams \u2013 who did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams \u2013 ran around at the back of the field until they inevitably collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, went under at the end of 2016.\n\nA rule shake-up in {{F1|2014}}, meant [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] emerged as the dominant force, with [[Lewis Hamilton]] winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, [[Nico Rosberg]], with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season (all other victories coming from [[Daniel Ricciardo]] of Red Bull). 2014 also saw a financial crisis which resulted in the backmarker [[Marussia F1|Marussia]] and [[Caterham F1|Caterham]] teams being put into [[administration (law)|administration]], alongside the uncertain futures of [[Force India]] and Sauber.

The teams (excepting [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and the other major manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] and [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in particular) were of the opinion that their rights and ability to compete against the larger and better funded teams were being negatively affected by a perceived bias on the part of the controlling organisation (FISA) toward the major manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the battle revolved around the commercial aspects of the sport (the FOCA teams were unhappy with the disbursement of proceeds from the races) and the technical regulations which, in FOCA's opinion, tended to be malleable according to the nature of the transgressor more than the nature of the transgression.\n\nThe war culminated in a [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]] boycott of the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]] months later. In theory, all FOCA teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the [[Formula One regulations|regulations]] and financial compensation (and extreme opposition to the accession of Balestre to the position of FISA president: both Colin Chapman of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] of [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] stated clearly that they would not continue in Formula One with Balestre as its governor).{{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} In practice, several of the FOCA teams backed out of the boycott, citing \"sponsor obligations\".

This concept would continue in 2017, but with Pirelli's thicker and wider tyres that tested extensively last year.\n\nTyre selections are announced over a month before each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select 10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force each driver to stick to the same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the new tyre.\n\nThat means for the opening five races, drivers will have seven of the softest compound, four of the middle compound and two of the hardest compound available. Pirelli has backup compounds for introduction later in the season, if its initial batch proves to be too conservative in terms of performance or leads to greater levels of degradation than expected.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 Grand Prix tyre compound selections|url=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/18451342/2017-grand-prix-tyre-compound-selections|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Qualifying===\n[[File:BAR pitwall.jpg|thumb|left|A typical pitwall control centre, allowing team managers and strategists to communicate with their drivers and engineers]]\n\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on [[pole position]]. Grids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a [[Pre-qualification (Formula One)|pre-qualifying]] session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\n[[File:2011 Brazil GP - Lotus pitstop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Jarno Trulli]] pit-stop, for [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|Lotus]] at the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.<ref name=Qual>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Practice and qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than [[107% rule|107%]] of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.<ref name=Qual />\n\nEach car taking part in Q3 receives an 'extra' set of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1 or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather requires the use of wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed.<ref name=Tyres>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Tyres|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8680/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Tyres_and_Wheels.html|title=Tyres|website=Formula1.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> All of the drivers that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.\n\n===Race===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided he has not fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve (Sauber) qualifying at US Grand Prix 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] qualifying at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[Sauber C24]]]]\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2017 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |title=F1 race starting regulations |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race.\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The maximum race length was reduced to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1966 and {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current {{convert|305|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1989. However, street races like [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race and are \"Classified\" in the order they finished 90% of the race distance. If a leader comes across a back marker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag<ref>{{cite web|title=Flags |publisher=Formula One |date=21 June 2003 |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |accessdate=3 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120809/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |archivedate=2 July 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> telling him he is obliged to allow the leader to overtake him. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of him. A driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is said to have retired from the race and is \"Not Classified\" in the results. However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, he will be classified.\n\n[[File:Safety Car with Sebastian Vettel 2015 Malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mercedes-AMG GT]] [[safety car]] leading the field around the circuit at reduced speed]]\nThroughout the race, drivers may make [[pit stop]]s to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have [[Formula One tyres#Tyre summary|different colours on their sidewalls]]; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.\n\n; Race director\n: As of 2017, the race director in Formula One is [[Charlie Whiting]]. This role involves him generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in [[parc ferm\u00e9]] before a race, enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, he also plays a large role in sorting disputes amongst teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations.\n; Safety car\n: In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside [[Motorsport marshal|race marshals]], race officials may choose to deploy the [[safety car]]. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. [[Mercedes-Benz]] supplies [[Mercedes-AMG]] models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. Since 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|title=New safety car driver announced|publisher=GPUpdate.net|date=8 March 2000|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver [[Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder]]. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line, which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n=== Flags ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Flag\n!Meaning\n|-\n|Yellow\n|Indicates a hazard on or near the track (waved yellows indicate a hazard&nbsp;''on the track'', frozen yellows indicate a hazard&nbsp;''near the track'').

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem\u2014in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. From the 2010 season, refuelling\u2014which was reintroduced in 1994\u2014has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n===Points system===\n{{Main|List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n!9th\n!10th\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ffffbf\"|25\n|style=\"background-color:#dfdfdf\"|18\n|style=\"background-color:#ffdf9f\"|15\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|12\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|10\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|8\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|6\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|4\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|2\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|1\n|}\n\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. If both cars of a team finish in the points, they both receive Constructors' Championship points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by him count for the Drivers' Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Points|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8681/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA driver must be classified to receive points. To be classified, a driver need not finish the race, but complete at least 90% of the winner's race distance. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Classification|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8682/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the event that less than 75% of the race laps are completed by the winner, only half of the points listed in the table are awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the {{F1|1984}} season. The last occurrence was at the [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix]] when the race was called off after 31 laps due to torrential rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL513282820090405|title=Button wins Malaysian GP cut short by rain|last=Baldwin|first=Alan|date=5 April 2009|agency=Reuters  |publisher=Thomas Reuters Corporate|accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Constructors==\n{{See also|List of Formula One constructors|List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions}}\n[[File:Mschumacher 2002.jpg|thumb|[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] (pictured with [[Michael Schumacher]]) have competed in every season]]\nSince {{F1|1981}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/fiasco-introduction-timeline.html |title=Poachers turned gamekeepers: how the FOCA became the new FIA ''Part 1: Introduction and timeline'' |last=Diepraam |first=Mattijs |date=21 November 2007 |website=8W |publisher=FORIX/[[Autosport]].com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became more or less interchangeable. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the [[IndyCar Series]] which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"[[spec racing|spec series]]\" such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateers]], which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\n\nThe sport's debut season, {{F1|1950}}, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids.  Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\n[[File:Ayrton Senna 1988 Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[McLaren]] (pictured with [[Ayrton Senna]]) won all but one race in {{F1|1988}} with engine partner [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]]]]\n[[File:Fisichella R27 British GP 2007.JPG|thumb|left|[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] (pictured here in {{F1|2007}}) has had an active role in Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier since {{F1|1977}}]]\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"[[works team#Motorsport|works team]]\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. After having virtually disappeared by the early 1980s, factory teams made a comeback in the 1990s and 2000s and formed up to half the grid with Ferrari, Jaguar, BMW, Renault, Toyota, and Honda either setting up their own teams or buying out existing ones.  Mercedes-Benz owned 40% of the McLaren team and manufactured the team's engines. Factory teams make up the top competitive teams; in 2008 wholly owned factory teams took four of the top five positions in the Constructors' Championship, and McLaren the other. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen). However, by the end of the 2000s factory teams were once again on the decline with only Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Renault lodging entries to the {{F1|2010}} championship.\n\nCompanies such as [[Coventry Climax|Climax]], [[Repco]], [[Cosworth]], [[Hart Racing Engines|Hart]], [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] and [[Supertec]], which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.  Beginning in 2007, the manufacturers' deep pockets and engineering ability took over, eliminating the last of the independent engine manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosworth return unlikely says Stewart |url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |website=F1-Live.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331163340/http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |archivedate=31 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200&nbsp;million ($125\u2013$225&nbsp;million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Adam|title=Mosley Stands Firm on Engine Freeze|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|publisher=Speed TV|accessdate=1 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105224446/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|archivedate=5 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams.

GP2 started in 2005, replacing [[Formula 3000]], which itself had replaced [[Formula Two]] as the last major stepping-stone into F1. Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One driver's title in 2008.<ref>Jack Brabham, F1 champion in 1959, 1960 and 1966, won the French Formula Two championship in 1966, but there was no international F2 championship that year.</ref> Drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. [[British F3]] has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including [[Nigel Mansell]], [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] having moved straight from that series to Formula One. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]], who went straight from Formula Renault to F1, as well as [[Max Verstappen]], who made his debut following a single season in [[FIA Formula 3 European Championship|European F3]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Five F1 champions who wouldn't have made their debuts|url=http://www.crash.net/f1/feature/212868/1/five-f1-champions-who-wouldnt-have-made-their-debuts.html|website=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[American open-wheel car racing]] has also contributed to the Formula One grid with mixed results. [[Champ Car|CART]] Champions [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] became F1 World Champions, while [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won seven races in F1. Other CART (also known as ChampCar) Champions, like [[Michael Andretti]] and [[Alessandro Zanardi]] won no races in F1. Other drivers have taken different paths to F1; Damon Hill raced motorbikes, and Michael Schumacher raced in [[sports car racing|sports cars]], albeit after climbing through the junior single seater ranks. Former F1 driver [[Paul di Resta]] raced in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] until he was signed with [[Force India]] in 2011. To race, however, the driver must hold an [[FIA Super Licence]]\u2013ensuring that the driver has the requisite skills, and will not therefore be a danger to others. Some drivers have not had the licence when first signed to a F1 team; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen received the licence despite having only 23 car races to his credit.\n\n===Beyond F1===\n[[File:Porsche 919 Hybrid 20.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Mans Prototype|LMP1 cars]] have become a popular destination for retired F1 drivers, in this example [[Mark Webber]]]]\n[[File:2015 London ePrix, Di Grassi (12).jpg|thumb|right|Many Ex-F1 drivers compete regularly in the new [[Formula E]] series]]\nMost F1 drivers retire in their mid to late 30s. Some F1 drivers have left to race in the United States\u2014[[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] duelled for the 1993 [[Champ Car|CART]] title, [[Rubens Barrichello]] moved to [[IndyCar]] in 2012, while [[Jacques Villeneuve]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] and [[Scott Speed]] moved to [[NASCAR]].\n\nSome drivers have moved from F1 to racing in disciplines with fewer races during the season. The German touring car championship, the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]], is a popular category involving ex-drivers such as two-time champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and F1 race winners [[Jean Alesi]], [[David Coulthard]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]]. In recent years, it has become common for former F1 drivers to take up factory seats driving [[LMP1]] cars in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], with notable drivers including [[Mark Webber]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Anthony Davidson]], [[Alexander Wurz]], [[Kazuki Nakajima]], and [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]].  A series for former Formula One drivers, called [[Grand Prix Masters]], ran briefly in 2005 and 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Masters series officially wound up|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/64156|accessdate=4 July 2008|work=[[Autosport]]|date=29 November 2007}}</ref> Other drivers have moved to [[Formula E]] such as Nelson Piquet Jr., S\u00e9bastien Buemi, [[Bruno Senna]], [[Jaime Alguersuari]], [[Nick Heidfeld]], [[Jarno Trulli]], [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]], [[Felipe Massa]], [[Stoffel Vandoorne]], and more. Some drivers, such as [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]], [[Narain Karthikeyan]] and [[Jos Verstappen]] went on to race in the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series. During its existence from 2008 to 2011, [[Superleague Formula]] attracted ex-Formula One drivers like [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]] and [[Giorgio Pantano]].\n\nOther former F1 drivers, like [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Gerhard Berger]], [[Alain Prost]] and [[Niki Lauda]] returned to F1 as team owners while their former competitors have become [[colour commentator]]s for TV coverage such as [[James Hunt]] ([[BBC]]), [[Martin Brundle]] (BBC, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Sky Sports|Sky]]), [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] (NBC), [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] (BBC, [[Nine Network]] and [[Ten Network]]), David Coulthard (BBC and [[Channel 4]]), [[Luciano Burti]] for [[Globo TV|Globo]] (Brazil), and Jean Alesi for Italian national network [[RAI]]. Others, such as [[Damon Hill]] and [[Jackie Stewart]], take active roles in running motorsport in their own countries. [[Carlos Reutemann]] became a politician and served as governor of his native state in Argentina.\n\n==Grands Prix==\n[[File:Formula_1_all_over_the_world-2018.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|World map showing location of Formula 1 Grands Prix: countries marked in green are on the 2018 race schedule, those in dark grey have hosted a Formula One race in the past]]\n{{See also|List of Formula One Grands Prix}}\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural {{F1|1950}} world championship season comprised only seven races, while the {{F1|2016}} season contained twenty-one races. Although throughout the first decades of the world championship there were no more than eleven Grands Prix a season, a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of sixteen/seventeen by the late 1970s; simultaneously non-championship events ended by 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 19 races. In {{F1|2016}} the calendar peaked at twenty-one events, the highest number of world championship races in one season.\n\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the [[Indianapolis 500]], which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the [[United States Grand Prix]]. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in {{F1|1953}}, and [[Moroccan Grand Prix|Morocco]] hosted the first African World Championship race in {{F1|1958}}. Asia (Japan in {{F1|1976}}) and Oceania (Australia in {{F1|1985}}) followed, and the first race in the Middle East was held in {{F1|2004}}. The nineteen races of the {{F1|2014}} season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with ten Grands Prix held outside Europe.\n[[File:Formula one.jpg|thumb|Cars wind through the [[infield]] section of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]]]\n\nSome of the Grands Prix, such as the oldest recognised event the [[French Grand Prix]], pre-date the formation of the World Championship and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The [[British Grand Prix|British]] and [[Italian Grand Prix|Italian]] Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German and French Grands Prix. The [[Monaco Grand Prix]], first held in 1929 and run continuously since 1955, is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=His Serene Highness Prince Rainier of Monte Carlo awarded the first FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport|website=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|date=14 October 2004|url=http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2004/141004-01.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115023910/http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2004/141004-01.html|archivedate=15 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally each nation has hosted a single Grand Prix, which carries the name of the country. If a single country hosts multiple Grands Prix in a year they receive different names. In European countries, the second event has often been titled the [[European Grand Prix]], or named after a neighbouring state without a race. The United States has held six separate Grands Prix, including the Indianapolis 500, with the additional events named after the host city. Grands Prix are not always held at the same circuit each year, and may switch locations due to the suitability of the track or the financial status of the race organisers. The German Grand Prix currently alternates between the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and [[Hockenheimring]] circuits, and others such as the American and French races have switched venues throughout their history.\n\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural {{f1 gp|2008|Singapore}} hosted the first Formula One night race,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6063.html |title=Singapore confirms 2008 night race |website=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Administration |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517074908/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6063.html |archivedate=17 May 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> which was followed in 2009 by the day\u2013night [[Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]] and then the [[Bahrain Grand Prix]] which converted to a night race in 2014.

The ''[[pit stop|pit lane]]'', where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal.\n\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]], [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit|Melbourne]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]], [[Sochi International Street Circuit|Sochi]] and [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]] although races in other urban locations come and go ([[Las Vegas]] and [[Detroit]], for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed\u2014most recently [[Grand Prix of America|New Jersey]]. Several circuits have been completely laid out on public roads in the past, such as [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] in Spain, though Monaco is the only one that remains. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks. Three-time World champion [[Nelson Piquet]] famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/2011/05/24/monaco-challenge-remains-unique |title=Monaco challenge remains unique \u2013 Formula 1 |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the new [[Bahrain International Circuit]], added in {{F1|2004}} and designed\u2014like most of F1's new circuits\u2014by [[Hermann Tilke]]. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n\nOld favourites the [[\u00d6sterreichring]] (today the Red Bull Ring) and the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]], returned to the calendar in 2014 and 2015 respectively.\n\nThe [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Sochi Autodrom]] in [[Sochi]] and the [[Baku City Circuit]] in [[Azerbaijan]] have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012.\n\nA single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least 5,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |title=Sport : F-1 race at Sohna or Greater Noida |work=The Hindu |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n==Cars and technology==\n{{Main|Formula One car|Formula One engines|Formula One tyres}}\n[[File:McLaren MP4-21 rear.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Top view of the rear of a {{F1|2006}} [[McLaren MP4-21]]]]\n\nModern Formula One cars are [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]], hybrid, open cockpit, [[open wheel car|open wheel]] single-seaters.

The whole car, including engine, fluids and driver, weighs only {{convert|691|kg|lb|abbr=on}} \u2013 the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2014/1/15408.html |title=A racing revolution?

This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance and the current generation of cars sport a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\n\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the [[tire|tyres]]. From {{F1|1998}} to {{F1|2008}}, the tyres in Formula One were not \"[[slick tyre|slicks]]\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |title=Tyres |accessdate=4 July 2008 |publisher=Formula One |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218202246/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the {{F1|2009}} season.

Ecclestone experimented with a digital television package (known colloquially as [[Bernievision]]) which was launched at the [[1996 German Grand Prix]] in co-operation with German digital television service \"DF1\", 30 years after the first GP colour TV broadcast, the [[1967 German Grand Prix]]. This service offered the viewer several simultaneous feeds (such as super signal, on board, top of field, backfield, highlights, pit lane, timing) which were produced with cameras, technical equipment and staff different from those used for the conventional coverage. It was introduced in many countries over the years, but was shut down after the {{F1|2002}} season for financial reasons.\n\nTV stations all take what is known as the \"World Feed\", either produced by the FOM (Formula One Management) or occasionally, the \"host broadcaster\". The only station that originally differed from this was \"Premiere\"\u2014a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard channel. This service was more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of a whole different feed for the digital interactive services was thought too much. This was in large part because of the failure of the \"[[F1 Digital +]]\" Channel launched through [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] in the United Kingdom. Prices were too high for viewers, considering they could watch both the qualifying and the races themselves free on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\nHowever, upon the commencement of its coverage for the 2009 season, the [[BBC]] reintroduced complementary features such as the \"red button\" in-car camera angles, multiple soundtracks (broadcast commentary, [[CBBC]] commentary for children, or ambient sound only) and a rolling highlights package. Different combinations of these features are available across the various digital platforms ([[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media#Virgin TV|Virgin Media cable]] and the BBC F1 web site) prior to, during, and after the race weekend. Not all services are available across all the various platforms due to technical constraints. The BBC also broadcasts a post-race programme called \"F1 Forum\" on the digital terrestrial platforms' \"red button\" interactive services.\n\n[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Vettel]] after securing pole position at the [[2011 Malaysian Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAn announcement was made on 12 January 2011, on the official Formula 1 website (Formula1.com), that F1 would adopt the [[high-definition television|HD]] format for the 2011 season offering a world feed at a data rate of 42 Megabits/second (MPEG-2).<ref>{{cite web |title=Formula One Coverage goes HD for 2011 |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/1/11634.html |publisher=Formula1.com |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref> The BBC subsequently announced later that day that their 2011 F1 coverage would be broadcast in HD<ref>{{cite news | title = New role for Eddie Jordan as BBC F1 coverage goes HD | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9359509.stm |publisher=BBC Sport  |date= 12 January 2011|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref> which has been made immediately possible due to SIS LIVE, the provider of the BBC's F1 outside broadcast coverage, having already upgraded their technical facilities to HD as of the 2010 Belgian Grand Prix.<ref>{{cite web | title = SIS LIVE upgrades OB coverage of Formula 1 for BBC Sport | url = http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | publisher = sislive.tv | accessdate = 12 January 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022718/http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | archivedate = 5 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that [[Sky Sports]] and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 in 2012.

He mainly played as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper|sweeper]] or as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and spent his entire 20-year career with [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], captaining the club for 15 seasons. He is considered one of the greatest defenders of all-time and was ranked 19th in ''[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]]'' magazine's list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Soccer 100 Players of the Century|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamHons/HonsWldSocPlyrsCent.html|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> With Milan, he won three [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, six Serie A titles, four Supercoppa Italiana titles, two [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]]s and two Intercontinental Cups.\n\nWith the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]], he won the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]. He also played in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], where he was named in the [[FIFA World Cup awards#All-Star Team|FIFA World Cup All-Star Team]], finishing third in the competition. At the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], he was named Italy's captain and was an integral part of the squad that reached the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], although he would miss a penalty in the resulting shoot-out as [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] lifted the trophy. Baresi also represented Italy at two [[UEFA European Championship]]s, in [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]] and [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988]], and at the [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]], reaching the semi-finals on each occasion.\n\nThe younger brother of former footballer [[Giuseppe Baresi]], after joining the Milan senior team as a youngster, Franco Baresi was initially nicknamed \"Piscinin\", [[Milanese]] for \"little one\". Due to his skill and success, he was later known as \"Kaiser Franz\", a reference to fellow sweeper [[Franz Beckenbauer]].<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/franco-baresi.html|title=Storie di Calcio:  FRANCO BARESI - Calcio, tackle e fantasia|website=storiedicalcio.altervista.org|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> In 1999, he was voted Milan's Player of the Century.

The following season, he was made a member of the starting 11, playing as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] or as a centreback, winning the 1978\u201379 Serie A title, Milan's tenth overall, playing alongside [[Fabio Capello]] and [[Gianni Rivera]].<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Franco Baresi\"/>\n\nThis success was soon followed by a dark period in the club's history, when Milan was relegated to [[Serie B]] twice during the early 1980s. Milan were relegated in [[1979\u201380 Serie A|1980]] for being involved in the [[Totonero 1980|match fixing scandal of 1980]], and once again after finishing third-last in the [[1981\u201382 Serie A|1981\u201382 season]], after having just returned to Serie A the previous season, after winning the 1980\u201381 Serie B title. Despite being a member of the Euro 1980 Italy squad that had finished fourth, and the 1982 World Cup-winning team, Baresi elected to stay with Milan, winning the Serie B title for the second time during the 1982\u201383 season and bringing Milan back to Serie A. After [[Aldo Maldera]] and [[Fulvio Collovati]] left the club in 1982, Baresi was appointed Milan's captain, at age 22, and would hold this position for much of his time at the club, becoming a symbol and a leader for the team. During this bleak period for Milan, Baresi did manage to win a Mitropa Cup in 1982 and reached the [[Coppa Italia]] final during 1984\u201385 season, although the team failed to dominate in Serie A.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\"/><ref name=\"Franchino (detto Franco) BARESI (II)\"/>\n\nDuring the end of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, Baresi was at the heart of a notable all-Italian defence alongside [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Alessandro Costacurta]], [[Mauro Tassotti]] and later [[Christian Panucci]], under managers [[Arrigo Sacchi]] and Fabio Capello, a defence which is regarded by many as one of the greatest of all-time.{{efn|See<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/juventus/111/blog/post/2834534/gianluigi-buffon-record-cements-his-legacy-greatest-keeper|title=Gianluigi Buffon record cements his legacy as greatest keeper of all-time|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=James Horncastle|accessdate=21 March 2016|date=21 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/21/gianluigi-buffon-clean-sheet-record-juventus-torino-sebastiano-rossi|title=Gianluigi Buffon humble as clean sheet record tumbles, but delight not universal|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Paolo Bandini|date=21 March 2016|accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/08/joy-of-six-great-defences|title=The Joy of Six: Great defences|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Rob Smyth|date=8 May 2009|accessdate=9 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/nazionale/2013/11/19/news/rivoluzione_filosofica_prandelli-71352856/?refresh_ce|title=Nazionale: 2013, addio al catenaccio.

Under Sacchi, Milan won the Serie A title in [[1987\u201388 Serie A|1987\u201388]], with Baresi helping Milan to concede only 14 goals. This title was immediately followed by an [[Supercoppa Italiana]] in [[1988 Supercoppa Italiana|1988]] the next season, and back-to-back [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]] in [[1988\u201389 European Cup|1988\u201389]] and [[1989\u201390 European Cup|1989\u201390]].<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Franco Baresi\"/> Baresi was also runner-up to teammate Van Basten for the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 1989, finishing ahead of his other teammate Frank Rijkaard, and was named [[Guerin d'Oro|Serie A Footballer of the Year]] in 1989\u201390. Milan also reached the Coppa Italia final during the 1989\u201390 season.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\"/><ref name=\"Franchino (detto Franco) BARESI (II)\"/>\n\nBaresi went on to win four more Serie A titles with Milan under Fabio Capello, including three consecutive titles in [[1991\u201392 Serie A|1991\u201392]], [[1992\u201393 Serie A|1992\u201393]] and the [[1993\u201394 Serie A|1993\u201394]] seasons. Baresi helped Milan win the 1991\u201392 title undefeated, helping Milan to go unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 matches. Milan also scored a record 74 goals that season. During the 1993\u201394 season, Baresi helped Milan concede a mere 15 goals in Serie A, helping the club to finish the season with the best defence. Baresi also won three consecutive Supercoppa Italiana under Capello, in [[1992 Supercoppa Italiana|1992]], [[1993 Supercoppa Italiana|1993]] and [[1994 Supercoppa Italiana|1994]]. Milan also reached three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals during the [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393]], [[1993\u201394 UEFA Champions League|1993\u201394]] and [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League|1994\u201395]] seasons, losing to [[Olympique Marseille|Marseille]] in 1992\u201393 and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 1994\u201395. Baresi won the third European Cup/UEFA Champions League of his career in 1993\u201394 when Milan defeated [[Johan Cruyff]]'s [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] \"Dream Team\" 4\u20130 in [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]]. Baresi also managed to win the [[1994 UEFA Super Cup]], although Milan were defeated in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup, the [[1993 UEFA Super Cup]] and the 1993 Intercontinental Cup. Under Capello, Milan and Baresi were able to capture another Serie A title during [[1995\u201396 Serie A|1995\u201396 season]], Baresi's sixth.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\"/><ref name=\"Franchino (detto Franco) BARESI (II)\"/>\n\nBaresi retired at the end of the [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 Serie A season]], at age 37. In his 20 seasons with Milan, he won six Serie A titles, three European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (reaching five finals in total), two Intercontinental Cups (four finals in total), four European Supercups (five finals in total), four Supercoppa Italiana (five finals in total), two Serie B titles and a Mitropa Cup.<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Franco Baresi\"/> He scored 31 goals for Milan, 21 of which were on penalties, and, despite being a defender, he was the top scorer of the Coppa Italia during the 1989\u201390 season, the only trophy which he failed to win with Milan, reaching the final twice during his career. His final goal for Milan was scored in a 2\u20131 win against [[Padova Calcio|Padova]] on 27 August 1995. In his honour, Milan retired his number 6 shirt, which he had worn throughout his career.<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Franco Baresi\"/> The captain's armband, which he had worn for 15 seasons, was handed over to Paolo Maldini. Milan organised a celebration match in his honour, which was played on 28 October 1997 at the [[San Siro]], featuring many footballing stars.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\"/><ref name=\"Franchino (detto Franco) BARESI (II)\"/>\n\n==International career==\nAt age 20, while still playing in the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-21 side]], Baresi was named in [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s 22-man squad for the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championship]] (along with his older brother Giuseppe) by manager [[Enzo Bearzot]]. The tournament was held on home soil and Italy finished fourth. However, unlike his brother, Franco Baresi did not play a single match in the tournament. Euro 1980 would be the only time the two brothers were on the Italy squad together at a major tournament. At age 22, Baresi was named in Italy's squad for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=imperial>{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174375/|title=Milan and Italy's imperial sweeper|accessdate=17 March 2014|work=FIFA}}</ref> The ''Azzurri'' won their third [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], defeating [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in [[1982 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]], but Baresi, once again, was not selected to play a match throughout the tournament.<ref name=baresi>{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=174375/|title=Franco BARESI|accessdate=17 March 2014|work=FIFA}}</ref> Baresi was also a member of the Italy squad that took part in the 1984 Olympics. Italy finished in fourth place after a semi-final defeat to [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]], and losing the bronze medal match to [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. Baresi scored a goal against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] during the group stage.\n\nBaresi won his first senior international [[Cap (association football)|cap]] in a [[UEFA Euro 1984|1984 UEFA Championship]] [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|qualifying]] match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Florence]], on 14 December 1982, a 0\u20130 draw.<ref name=imperial/> Italy, however, ultimately failed to qualify for the final tournament.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\"/><ref name=\"Nazionale in cifre: Convocazioni e presenze in campo - Franco Baresi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=19&squadra=1|title=Nazionale in cifre: Convocazioni e presenze in campo - Franco Baresi|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=10 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBaresi was not included in Italy's squad for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] by coach Enzo Bearzot, who saw him as being more of a midfielder than a defender (although his brother Giuseppe was selected as a defender for the World Cup, as well as [[Roberto Tricella]]).<ref name=imperial/> He returned to the team for the [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988 European Championship]], playing as a sweeper, where Italy reached the semi-finals under [[Azeglio Vicini]], becoming an undisputed first team member and playing in every match. He made his first appearance in a World Cup finals match in the 1990 tournament, which was held on home soil, and he played in every match as one of the starting centre-backs, as Italy finished in third-place, after being eliminated by defending champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals.<ref name=baresi/> Baresi helped the Italian defence to keep five consecutive clean sheets, only conceding two goals, and going unbeaten for a [[FIFA World Cup records|World Cup record]] of 518 minutes, until they were beaten by an Argentinian equaliser in the semi-final. His performances earned him a spot on the [[1990 FIFA World Cup#All-star team|1990 World Cup Team of the tournament]].<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Franco Baresi\"/>\n\nAfter replacing [[Giuseppe Bergomi]] as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] under his former manager at Milan, Arrigo Sacchi, Baresi sustained an injury to his meniscus in Italy's second group match, a 1\u20130 win against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], and missed most of the tournament.<ref name=baresi/> He returned to the squad 25 days later, in time for [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]], with a dominant defensive performance, helping Italy to keep a clean sheet against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], despite the key defensive absences of his Milan teammates Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti. After a 0\u20130 deadlock following extra time, the match went to a penalty shootout, and Baresi subsequently missed his penalty, suffering from severe cramps and fatigue.

A given stage of rock and the corresponding age of time will by convention have the same name, and the same boundaries.\n\nRock [[Series (geology)|series]] are divided into stages, just as geological epochs are divided into ages.  Stages can be divided into smaller stratigraphic units called [[chronozone]]s.  (See chart at right for full terminology hierarchy.) Stages may also be divided into substages or indeed grouped as superstages.<ref>http://stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm</ref>\n\nThe term '''faunal stage''' is sometimes used, referring to the fact that the same [[fauna]] (animals) are found throughout the layer (by definition).\n\n==Definition==\n\nStages are primarily defined by a consistent set of fossils ([[biostratigraphy]]) or a consistent magnetic polarity (see [[paleomagnetism]]) in the rock. Usually one or more [[index fossil]]s that are common, found worldwide, easily recognized, and limited to a single, or at most a few, stages are used to define the stage's bottom. \n\nThus, for example in the local North American subdivision, a paleontologist finding fragments of the [[trilobite]] ''Olenellus'' would identify the beds as being from the [[Waucoban Stage]] whereas fragments of a later trilobite such as ''Elrathia'' would identify the stage as [[Albertan Stage|Albertan]]. \n\nStages were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries as they were the major tool available for dating and correlating rock units prior to the development of [[seismology]] and [[radioactive dating]] in the second half of the 20th Century. Microscopic analysis of the rock ([[petrology]]) is also sometimes useful in confirming that a given segment of rock is from a particular age.\n\nOriginally, faunal stages were only defined regionally; however as additional stratigraphic and geochonologic tools, were developed, stages were defined over broader and broader areas. More recently, the adjective \"faunal\" has been dropped as regional and global correlations of rock sequences have become relatively certain and there is less need for faunal labels to define the age of formations. A tendency developed to use European and, to a lesser extent, Asian, stage names for the same time period worldwide, even though the faunas in other regions often had little in common with the stage as originally defined.\n\n==International standardization==\n{{Update|section|date=August 2014}}\nBoundaries and names are established by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]].  As of 2008, the ICS is nearly finished a task begun in 1974, subdividing the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eonothem]] into internationally accepted stages using two types of benchmark.  For younger stages, a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP), a physical [[outcrop]] clearly demonstrates the boundary.  For older stages, a [[Global Standard Stratigraphic Age]] (GSSA) is an absolute date. The benchmarks will give a much greater certainty that results can be compared with confidence in the date determinations, and such results will have farther scope than any evaluation based solely on local knowledge and conditions. \n\nIn many regions local subdivisions and classification criteria are still used along with the newer internationally coordinated uniform system, but once the research establishes a more complete international system, it is expected that local systems will be abandoned.\n\n==Stages and lithostratigraphy==\nStages can include many [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] units (for example [[formation (geology)|formations]], [[bed (geology)|beds]], [[member (geology)|members]], etc.) of differing rock types that were being laid down in different environments at the same time. In the same way, a lithostratigraphic unit can include a number of stages or parts of them.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[European land mammal age]]\n*[[Geologic record]]\n*[[Geologic time scale]]\n*[[North American land mammal age]]\n*[[Type locality (geology)]]\n*[[List of geochronologic names]]\n*[[List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gehling\n  | first = James\n  | last2 = Jensen\n  | first2 = S\u00f6ren\n  | last3 = Droser\n  | first3 = Mary\n  | last4 = Myrow\n  | first4 = Paul\n  | last5 = Narbonne\n  | first5 = Guy\n  | title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland\n  | journal = Geological Magazine\n  | volume = 138\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 213\u2013218\n  | date = March 2001\n  \n  | url = http://www.journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=74669\n  | doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X\n  | id = 1\n}}\n* Hedberg, H.D., (editor), ''International stratigraphic guide: A guide to stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedure'', New York, John Wiley and Sons, 1976\n* [http://www.stratigraphy.org/cheu.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart] from the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stratigraphy.org/over.htm The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP)]: overview\n*[http://www.stratigraphy.org/gssp.htm Chart of The Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSP)]: chart\n*[http://www.rocksandminerals.com/geotime/geotime.htm Geotime chart displaying geologic time periods compared to the fossil record], deals with chronology and classifications for laymen (not GSSPs)\n\n{{Geological history| |state=collapsed}}\n{{Chronology}}\n{{Geology}}\n\n\n[[Category:Chronostratigraphy]]\n[[Category:Geological ages|.]]\n[[Category:Geochronology]]\n[[Category:Geologic time scales]]\n[[Category:Geology terminology]]\n[[Category:Geological units]]\n[[Category:Paleogeography]]\n[[Category:Paleobiology]]\n[[Category:Units of time]]", "sha1": "eyt3e3ft8iri7vkamzatd41oxvyq3ii"}}, {"title": "Franz Kafka", "ns": "0", "id": "10858", "revision": {"id": "866101618", "parentid": "866096372", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T07:48:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Snowded", "id": "1988889"}, "comment": "that's adding commentary - original is pretty clear", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Kafka}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox person\n | name             = Franz Kafka\n | image            = Kafka1906 cropped.jpg\n | imagesize        =\n | caption          = Kafka in 1906\n | alt              = Black-and-white photograph of Kafka as a young man with dark hair in a formal suit\n | birth_date       = {{birth date|1883|7|3|df=y}}\n | birth_place      = {{plainlist|\n* [[Prague]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], [[Austria-Hungary]]\n* (now [[Czech Republic]])\n}}\n | death_date       = {{death date and age|1924|6|3|1883|7|3|df=y}}\n | death_place      = Kierling, part of [[Klosterneuburg]], [[Lower Austria]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]]\n | occupation       = {{flatlist |\n* [[Novelist]]\n* short story writer\n* insurance officer\n}}\n | alma_mater       = [[German Charles-Ferdinand University]] in Prague\n | citizenship      = {{flatlist | \n* [[Cisleithania|Austria]]\n* [[Czechoslovakia]]{{sfn|Koelb|2010|p=12}}{{sfn|Czech Embassy|2012}}\n}}\n | parents          = {{plainlist |\n* Hermann Kafka\n* Julie Kafka ([[n\u00e9e]] L\u00f6wy)\n}}\n | notable_works    = {{plainlist |\n*  \"{{lang|de|[[The Metamorphosis|Die Verwandlung]]|italic=no}}\" (\"The Metamorphosis\")\n* {{lang|de|[[The Trial|Der Process]]}} (''The Trial'')\n*  \"{{lang|de|[[The Judgment|Das Urteil]]|italic=no}}\" (\"The Judgment\")\n* {{lang|de|[[The Castle (novel)|Das Schloss]]}} (''The Castle'')\n* {{lang|de|[[Contemplation (Kafka)|Betrachtung]]}} (''Contemplation'')\n* {{lang|de|[[A Hunger Artist (collection)|Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler]]}} (''{{nowrap|A Hunger Artist}}'')\n* {{lang|de|[[Letters to Felice|Briefe an Felice]]}} (''{{nowrap|Letters to Felice}}'')\n}}\n | style            = [[Modernist literature|Modernism]]\n | signature        = Franz Kafka's signature.svg\n}}\n'''Franz Kafka'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|UK|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|f|k|\u0259}}, {{IPAc-en|US|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|f|-}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/kafka \"Kafka\"], ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''</ref> {{IPA-de|\u02c8kafka\u02d0|lang}}; {{IPA-cs|\u02c8kafka|lang}}; in Czech he was sometimes called '''Franti\u0161ek Kafka'''.}} (3 July 1883&nbsp;\u2013 3 June 1924) was a [[German language|German-speaking]] [[Bohemia]]n [[Jewish]] novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of [[20th century in literature|20th-century literature]].

He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education he was employed by an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from [[tuberculosis]].\n\nFew of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections {{lang|de|[[Contemplation (Kafka)|Betrachtung]]}} (''Contemplation'') and {{lang|de|[[A Country Doctor (collection)|Ein Landarzt]]}} (''A Country Doctor''), and individual stories (such as \"{{lang|de|Die Verwandlung|italic=no}}\") were published in literary magazines but received little public attention. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels {{lang|de|Der Process}}, {{lang|de|Das Schloss}} and {{lang|de|[[Amerika (novel)|Der Verschollene]]}} (translated as both ''Amerika'' and ''The Man Who Disappeared''), were ordered by Kafka to be destroyed by his friend [[Max Brod]], who nonetheless ignored his friend's direction and published them after Kafka's death. His work went on to influence a vast range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers during the 20th century.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early Life ===\n[[File:Kafka's parents c1913.jpg|thumb|Hermann and Julie Kafka]]\nKafka was born near the [[Old Town Square (Prague)|Old Town Square]] in Prague,<!-- next to the Church of St Nicholas --> then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His family were German-speaking middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. His father, Hermann Kafka (1854\u20131931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka,{{sfn|Gilman|2005|pp = 20\u201321}}{{sfn|Northey|1997|pp = 8\u201310}} a {{lang|he-Latn|shochet}} or [[Shechita|ritual slaughterer]] in [[Osek (Strakonice District)|Osek]], a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near [[Strakonice]] in southern Bohemia.{{sfn|Kohoutikriz|2011}} Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fashion retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a [[Western Jackdaw|jackdaw]] ({{lang|cs|kavka}} in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as ''kafka'') as his business logo.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 3\u20135}} Kafka's mother, Julie (1856\u20131934), was the daughter of Jakob L\u00f6wy, a prosperous retail merchant in [[Pod\u011bbrady]],{{sfn|Northey|1997|p = 92}} and was better educated than her husband.{{sfn|Gilman|2005|pp = 20\u201321}}\n\n[[File:Czech-2013-Prague-Plaque (birthplace of Franz Kafka).jpg|thumb|left|Plaque marking the birthplace of Franz Kafka in Prague, designed by Karel Hlad\u00edk and Jan Kaplick\u00fd, 1966]]\nKafka's parents probably spoke a German influenced by [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] that was sometimes pejoratively called [[Yiddish language#Secularization|Mauscheldeutsch]], but, as the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak [[Standard German]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|pp = 147\u2013148}} Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest.{{sfn|Hamalian|1974|p = 3}} Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (\"Ellie\") (1889\u20131944), Valerie (\"Valli\") (1890\u20131942) and [[Ottla Kafka|Ottilie]] (\"Ottla\") (1892\u20131943). They all died during the [[Holocaust]] of World War II. Valli was deported to the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]] in occupied Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favourite sister.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Metamorphosis|last=Kafka|first=Franz|publisher=Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-9968-5|location=1230 Avenue of Americas|pages=ix}}</ref><!-- cite here? -->\n\nHermann is described by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a \"huge, selfish, overbearing businessman\"{{sfn|Corngold|1972|pp = xii, 11}} and by Franz Kafka as \"a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature\".{{sfn|Kafka-Franz, Father|2012}} On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12&nbsp;hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely,{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 9}} and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship<!-- abrupt shift to troubled relationship here; suggest moving down later b/c more to do with later life --><!-- - the father issues have roots in early life, which is why it was put here - --> with his father is evident in his {{lang|de|[[Letter to His Father|Brief an den Vater]]}} (''Letter to His Father'') of more than 100&nbsp;pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character;{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 15\u201316}} his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 19\u201320}} The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 15, 17, 22\u201323}}\n\nThe Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 390\u2013391, 462\u2013463}}\n\n=== Education ===\n\nFrom 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the {{lang|de|Deutsche Knabenschule|italic=no}} German boys' elementary school at the {{lang|cs|Masn\u00fd trh/Fleischmarkt}} (meat market), now known as Masn\u00e1 Street. His Jewish education ended with his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] celebration at the age of 13.

In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 40\u201341}} He also joined a student club, {{lang|de|Lese- und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten|italic=no}} (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organised literary events, readings and other activities.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p = 179}} Among Kafka's friends were the journalist [[Felix Weltsch]], who studied philosophy, the actor [[Yitzchak Lowy]] who came from an orthodox [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Warsaw family, and the writers [[Oskar Baum]] and [[Franz Werfel]].{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 43\u201370}}\n\nAt the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met [[Max Brod]], a fellow law student who became a close friend for life.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p = 179}} Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound.{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 40}} Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life;{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 14}} together he and Brod read Plato's ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' in the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], on Brod's initiative, and [[Flaubert]]'s {{lang|fr|[[Sentimental Education|L'\u00e9ducation sentimentale]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|La Tentation de St. Antoine]]}} (''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'') in French, at his own suggestion.{{sfn|Brod|1966|pp = 53\u201354}} Kafka considered [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Flaubert, [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Franz Grillparzer]],{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 362}} and [[Heinrich von Kleist]] to be his \"true [[blood brother]]s\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|pp = 74, 273}} Besides these, he took an interest in [[Czech literature]]{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164\u2013210}} and was also very fond of the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 51, 122\u2013124}}{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 80\u201383}} Kafka was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906{{efn|Some sources list June (Murray) as Kafka's graduation month and some list July (Brod).{{sfn|Murray|2004|p=62}}{{sfn|Brod|1960|p=78}}}} and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.{{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390\u2013408}}\n\n=== Employment ===\n\n[[File:Na Porici 7, Prague.JPG|thumb|Former home of the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute]]\n\nOn 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the {{lang|it|[[Assicurazioni Generali]]|italic=no}}, an insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule\u2014from 08:00 until 18:00{{sfn|Karl|1991|p = 210}}{{sfn|Glen|2007|pp = 23\u201366}}\u2014making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the [[Workers' compensation|Worker's Accident Insurance Institute]] for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for [[personal injury]] to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor [[work safety]] policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with [[machine]] [[lathe]]s, [[drill]]s, [[planing machine]]s and [[rotary saw]]s which were rarely fitted with safety guards.{{sfn|Corngold et al.|2009|p = 28}}\n\nThe management professor [[Peter Drucker]] credits Kafka with developing the first civilian [[hard hat]] while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer.{{sfn|Drucker|2002|p = 24}}{{sfn|Corngold et al.|2009|pp = 250\u2013254}} His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a {{lang|de|Brotberuf}}, literally \"bread job\", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 26\u201330}} He would compile and compose the [[annual report]] on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 81\u201384}} Kafka usually got off work at 2 P.M., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 23\u201325}} Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 25\u201327}} In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term {{lang|de|Der enge Prager Kreis}} (\"The Close Prague Circle\") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.{{sfn|Spector|2000|p = 17}}{{sfn|Keren|1993|p = 3}}\n\nIn late 1911, Elli's husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first [[asbestos]] factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann & Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 34\u201339}} During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of [[Yiddish theatre]]. After seeing a Yiddish theatre troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka \"immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature\".{{sfn|Koelb|2010|p = 32}} This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 56\u201358}} It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 29, 73\u201375, 109\u2013110, 206}} Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World War{{nbsp}}I, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with [[tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 154}} with which he was diagnosed in 1917.{{sfn|Corngold|2011|pp = 339\u2013343}} In 1918 the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in [[sanatorium]]s.{{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390\u2013408}}\n\n=== Private life ===\n\nKafka never married. According to Brod, Kafka was \"tortured\" by sexual desire{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 186}} and Kafka's biographer [[Reiner Stach]] states that his life was full of \"incessant womanising\" and that he was filled with a fear of \"sexual failure\".{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 44, 207}} He visited brothels for most of his adult life{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 186, 191}}{{sfn|European Graduate School|2012}}{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 43}} and was interested in pornography.{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 186}} In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met [[Felice Bauer]], a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a [[dictaphone]] company. A week after the meeting at Brod's home, Kafka wrote in his diary:\n\n{{quote|Miss FB. When I arrived at Brod's on 13 August, she was sitting at the table. I was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at once. Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was. (I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so closely&nbsp;...) Almost broken nose. Blonde, somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat I looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an unshakeable opinion.{{sfn|Banville|2011}}{{sfn|K\u00f6hler|2012}}}}\n\nShortly after this, Kafka wrote the story \"{{lang|de|[[The Judgment|Das Urteil]]|italic=no}}\" (\"The Judgment\") in only one night and worked in a productive period on {{lang|de|[[Amerika (novel)|Der Verschollene]]}} (''The Man Who Disappeared'') and \"[[The Metamorphosis|Die Verwandlung]]\" (\"The Metamorphosis\"). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice.{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 1}} Kafka's extant letters to her were published as {{lang|de|[[Letters to Felice|Briefe an Felice]]}} (''Letters to Felice''); her letters do not survive.{{sfn|Banville|2011}}{{sfn|Seubert|2012}}{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 196\u2013197}} According to biographers Stach and [[James Hawes (author)|James Hawes]], around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid.{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 1}}{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 129, 198\u2013199}} Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time Kafka began a draft of the ''Letter to His Father'', who objected to Julie because of her [[Zionism|Zionist]] beliefs. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman.{{sfn|Murray|2004|pp = 276\u2013279}} While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was shy\u2014especially about his body.{{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390\u2013408}}\n\nStach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe \"Grete\" Bloch,{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp = 379\u2013389}} a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, although Kafka never knew about the child.

He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best time in his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and {{lang|de|Oktavhefte}} ([[octavo]]). From the notes in these books, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on ''Zettel'', single pieces of paper in no given order. They were later published as {{lang|de|[[The Z\u00fcrau Aphorisms|Die Z\u00fcrauer Aphorismen]] oder Betrachtungen \u00fcber S\u00fcnde, Hoffnung, Leid und den wahren Weg}} (The Z\u00fcrau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).{{sfn|Apel|2012|p = 28}}\n\nIn 1920 Kafka began an intense relationship with [[Milena Jesensk\u00e1]], a Czech journalist and writer.

Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and caused him to become interested in the [[Talmud]].{{sfn|Hempel|2002}} He worked on four stories, which he prepared to be published as {{lang|de|[[A Hunger Artist (collection)|Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler]]}} (''A Hunger Artist'').{{sfn|Brod|1966|p=389}}\n\n=== Personality ===\nKafka feared that people would find him mentally and physically repulsive.

While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in [[Liblice]], Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy.{{sfn|Bathrick|1995|pp = 67\u201370}} Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.{{sfn|Socialist Worker|2007}}\n\n=== Judaism and Zionism ===\n{{details|topic=Franz Kafka and Judaism|Franz Kafka and Judaism}}\n\n[[File:Franz Kafka 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|Kafka in 1910]]\n\nKafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew.{{sfn|History Guide|2006}} He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to [[Yiddish literature|Yiddish writers]].{{sfn|Haaretz|2008}} Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: \"What have I in common with Jews?

The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles\".{{sfn|Haaretz|2008}} Kafka considered moving to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant.

An illustrious example is Franz Kafka\".{{sfn|Rothkirchen|2005|p = 23}}\n\nTowards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergman in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine.

Some of his published texts were named {{lang|de|Erz\u00e4hlung}} (literally: [[narrative]]), others {{lang|de|Geschichte}} (literally: story). Some stories are relatively long; others are a single paragraph. His oldest surviving story is \"Der Unredliche in seinem Herzen\" (\"The Impure in His Heart\"), translated as \"[[Shamefaced Lanky and Impure in Heart]]\". It was not published but was part of a [[Letters to Family, Friends, and Editors (Franz Kafka)|letter to his friend]] [[Oskar Pollak]] in 1902. -->Kafka's earliest published works were eight stories which appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal ''[[Hyperion (journal)|Hyperion]]'' under the title {{lang|de|[[Contemplation (Kafka)|Betrachtung]]}} (''Contemplation''). He wrote the story \"{{lang|de|[[Description of a Struggle|Beschreibung eines Kampfes]]|italic=no}}\" (\"Description of a Struggle\"){{efn|\"{{lang|de|Kampf|italic=no}}\" also translates to \"fight\".}} in 1904; he showed it to Brod in 1905 who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to ''Hyperion''. Kafka published a fragment in 1908{{sfn|Pawel|1985|pp = 160\u2013163}} and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.{{sfn|Brod|1966|p = 388}}\n\nIn a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story \"Das Urteil\" (\"The Judgment\", literally: \"The Verdict\") and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fianc\u00e9e, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer.{{sfn|Brod|1966|ps = 114f}} The story is often considered Kafka's breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son's engagement.{{sfn|Ernst|2010}}{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 159, 192}} Kafka later described writing it as \"a complete opening of body and soul\",{{sfn|Stach|2005|p = 113}} a story that \"evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime\".{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 129}} The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated \"to Miss Felice Bauer\", and in subsequent editions \"for F.\"{{sfn|Brod|1966|p = 389}}\n\nIn 1912, Kafka wrote \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"[[The Metamorphosis]]\", or \"The Transformation\"),{{sfn|Brod|1966|p = 113}} published in 1915 in Leipzig.

The story \"[[A Hunger Artist|Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler]]\" (\"A Hunger Artist\"), published in the periodical {{lang|de|[[Neue Rundschau|Die neue Rundschau]]}} in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of [[hunger artist|starving himself for extended periods]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p = 131}} His last story, \"[[Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk|Josefine, die S\u00e4ngerin oder Das Volk der M\u00e4use]]\" (\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\"), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.{{sfn|Horstkotte|2009}}\n\n=== Novels ===\n\nHe began his first novel in 1912;{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 113}} its first chapter is the story \"[[The Stoker|Der Heizer]]\" (\"The Stoker\").

On 20 April 1924, the {{lang|de|[[Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Courier]]}} published Kafka's essay on [[Adalbert Stifter]].{{sfn|Krolop|1994|p = 103}}\n\n==== Max Brod ====\n\n[[File:Kafka Der Prozess 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of {{lang|de|[[The Trial|Der Prozess]]}}, 1925|alt=A simple book cover in green displays the name of the author and the book]]\n\nKafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and [[literary executor]] Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka's death; Kafka wrote: \"Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me{{nbsp}}... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread\".{{sfn|Kafka|1988|loc = publisher's notes}}{{sfn|McCarthy|2009}} Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939.{{sfn|Butler|2011|pp = 3\u20138}} Kafka's last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20{{nbsp}}notebooks and 35{{nbsp}}letters. These were confiscated by the [[Gestapo]] in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.{{sfn|Kafka Project SDSU|2012}}\n\nAs Brod published the bulk of the writings in his possession,{{sfn|Contijoch|2000}} Kafka's work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to arrange Kafka's notebooks in chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end.{{sfn|Kafka|2009|p = xxvii}}{{sfn|Diamant|2003|p = 144}} Brod finished many of Kafka's incomplete works for publication. For example, Kafka left {{lang|de|Der Process}} with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and {{lang|de|Das Schloss}} with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content;{{sfn|Diamant|2003|p = 144}} Brod rearranged chapters, copy edited the text, and changed the punctuation. {{lang|de|Der Process}} appeared in 1925 in {{lang|de|Verlag Die Schmiede}}. Kurt Wolff published two other novels, {{lang|de|Das Schloss}} in 1926 and ''Amerika'' in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as {{lang|de|[[The Great Wall of China (collection)|Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer]]}} ''(The Great Wall of China)'', including the [[The Great Wall of China (short story)|story of the same name]]. The book appeared in the {{lang|de|[[Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlag]]}}. Brod's sets are usually called the \"Definitive Editions\".{{sfn|Classe|2000|p = 749}}\n\n==== Modern editions ====\n\nIn 1961, [[Malcolm Pasley]] acquired most of Kafka's original handwritten work for the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Bodleian Library]].{{sfn|Jewish Heritage|2012}}{{sfn|Kafka|1998|loc = publisher's notes}} The text for {{lang|de|Der Process}} was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in [[Marbach am Neckar]], Germany.{{sfn|Kafka|1998|loc = publisher's notes}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2004|p = 681}} Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including [[Gerhard Neumann]], Jost Schillemeit and J\u00fcrgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels; {{lang|de|[[S.

Jost Schillemeit was the editor of {{lang|de|Der Verschollene}} ({{lang|de|Amerika}}) published in 1983. These are called the \"Critical Editions\" or the \"Fischer Editions\".{{sfn|Oxford Kafka Research Centre|2012}}\n\n==== Unpublished papers ====\n\nWhen Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka's unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary [[Esther Hoffe]].{{sfn|''Guardian''|2010}} She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the [[National Library of Israel]], which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]] in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of {{lang|de|Der Process}} for US$2&nbsp;million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive [[Museum of Modern Literature]] in Marbach am Neckar.{{sfn|''New York Times''|2010}}{{sfn|Buehrer|2011}} Only Eva was still alive as of 2012.{{sfn|NPR|2012}} A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued.{{sfn|Lerman|2010}} The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library argues they are \"cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people\".{{sfn|Lerman|2010}} The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012 that the papers were the property of the National Library.{{sfn|Rudoren|Noveck|2012}}\n\n==Critical response==\n=== Critical interpretations ===\nThe poet [[W. H. Auden]] called Kafka \"the [[Dante]] of the twentieth century\";{{sfn|Bloom|2002|p = 206}} the novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century.{{sfn|Durantaye|2007|pp = 315\u2013317}} [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] noted the reading of Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" showed him \"that it was possible to write in a different way\".{{sfn|Kafka-Franz|2012}}{{sfn|Paris Review|2012}} A prominent theme of Kafka's work, first established in the short story \"Das Urteil\",{{sfn|Gale Research|1979|pp = 288\u2013311}} is father\u2013son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement.{{sfn|Brod|1960|pp = 15\u201316}}{{sfn|Gale Research|1979|pp = 288\u2013311}} Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.{{sfn|Bossy|2001|p = 100}}\n\nKafka's style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of \"Die Verwandlung\" and \"Der Heizer\" by Oscar Walzel in ''Berliner Beitr\u00e4ge''.{{sfn|Furst|1992|p = 83}} The nature of Kafka's prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools.{{sfn|Socialist Worker|2007}} [[Marxism|Marxists]], for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka's works.{{sfn|Lib.com|2008}}{{sfn|Socialist Worker|2007}} Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism.{{sfn|Socialist Worker|2007}} The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of [[existentialism]].{{sfn|Sokel|2001|pp = 102\u2013109}} Some of Kafka's books are influenced by the [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental [[modernism|modernist]] genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burroughs claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships.{{sfn|Burrows|2011}} Others, such as [[Thomas Mann]], see Kafka's work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.{{sfn|Panichas|2004|pp = 83\u2013107}}{{sfn|Gray|1973|p = 3}}<!-- -{{sfn|Mann|Heller|1981|p={{page needed | date = August 2012 }}}} uncomment when page ref found- -->\n\nAccording to [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]], the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive\u2014and more joyful\u2014than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds.{{sfn|Kavanagh|1972|pp = 242\u2013253}}{{sfn|Rahn|2011}} Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer [[Milan Kundera]] suggests that Kafka's [[surreal humour|surrealist humour]] may have been an inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.{{sfn|Kundera|1988|pp = 82\u201399}}\n\nAttempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction.{{sfn|Glen|2007}}{{sfn|Banakar|2010}} Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work,{{sfn|Glen|2011|pp = 47\u201394}} in which the legal system is often oppressive.{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 216\u2013218}} The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control.{{sfn|Glen|2011|pp = 47\u201394}} Critics who support this [[absurdism|absurdist]] interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary:\n\n{{quote|Enclosed in my own four walls, I found myself as an immigrant imprisoned in a foreign country;... I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites, and very language defied comprehension;... though I did not want it, they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals;... I could not resist.{{sfn|Preece|2001|pp = 15\u201331}}}}\n\nHowever, James Hawes argues many of Kafka's descriptions of the legal proceedings in {{lang|de|Der Process}}\u2014metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear\u2014are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] rather than [[Adversarial system|adversarial]].{{sfn|Hawes|2008|pp = 212\u2013214}} Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was \"keenly aware of the legal debates of his day\".{{sfn|Banakar|2010}}{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2003|p = 224}} In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka's office writings as its point of departure,{{sfn|Corngold et al.|2009|pp = xi, 169, 188, 388}} Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law \"has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination\".{{sfn|Ghosh|2009}}\n\n=== Translations ===\n\nThe earliest English translations of Kafka's works were by [[Edwin Muir|Edwin and Willa Muir]], who in 1930 translated the first German edition of {{lang|de|Das Schloss}}. This was published as ''The Castle'' by [[Secker & Warburg]] in England and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States.{{sfn|''Guardian''|1930}} A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka's popularity in the United States during the late 1940s.{{sfn|Koelb|2010|p = 69}} The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by [[Schocken Books]] in 1948 as ''[[The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces]]'',{{sfn|Kafka|1948|pp = 3\u20134}} including additionally ''[[The First Long Train Journey]]'', written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's \"A Novel about Youth\", a review of Felix Sternheim's ''Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald'', his essay on Kleist's \"Anecdotes\", his review of the literary magazine ''[[Hyperion (magazine)|Hyperion]]'', and an epilogue by Brod.\n\nLater editions, notably those of 1954 (''[[Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings]]''), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and [[Ernst Kaiser (author)|Ernst Kaiser]],{{sfn|Kafka|1954|loc = publisher's notes}} which had been deleted by earlier publishers.{{sfn|Adler|1995}} Known as \"Definitive Editions\", they include translations of ''The Trial, Definitive'', ''[[The Castle, Definitive Edition, Muir Translation|The Castle, Definitive]]'', and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation.{{sfn|Sokel|2001|p = 63}} Published in 1961 by Schocken Books, ''[[Parables and Paradoxes]]'' presented in a bilingual edition by [[Nahum N. Glatzer]] selected writings,{{sfn|Preece|2001|p = 167}} drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel ''Der Process''.\n\nNew translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit{{nsmdns}}''[[The Castle, Critical Edition, Harman Translation|The Castle, Critical]]'' by [[Mark Harman (translator)|Mark Harman]] ([[Schocken Books]], 1998),{{sfn|Kafka|1998|loc = publisher's notes}} ''The Trial, Critical'' by [[Breon Mitchell]] (Schocken Books, 1998),{{sfn|Preece|2001|pp = xv, 225}} and ''Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared'' by [[Michael Hofmann]] ([[New Directions Publishing]], 2004).{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}}\n\n=== Translation problems to English ===\n{{further|Franz Kafka bibliography#English translations}}\n\nKafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop\u2014this being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is due to the construction of [[subordinate clauses in German]] which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text.{{sfn|Kafka|1996|p = xi}} German's more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English.{{sfn|Newmark|1991|pp = 63\u201364}} An example is the first sentence of Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:{{sfn|Bloom|2003|pp = 23\u201326}}\n\n{{quote|{{lang|de|Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Tr\u00e4umen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt|italic=no}}. (original)\n\nAs Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word-for-word translation){{sfn|Prinsky|2002}}}}\n\nAnother difficult problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely.{{sfn|Lawson|1960|pp = 216\u2013219}}{{sfn|Rhine|1989|pp = 447\u2013458}} One such instance is found in the first sentence of [[The Metamorphosis#Lost in translation|\"The Metamorphosis\"]]. English translators often render the word {{lang|de|Ungeziefer|italic=no}} as \"insect\"; in Middle German, however, {{lang|de|Ungeziefer|italic=no}} literally means \"an animal unclean for sacrifice\";{{sfn|Corngold|1973|p = 10}} in today's German it means vermin. <!-- Brod referred to it as Insekt, though.{{sfn|Brod|1960|p=? will add when source is found again}} --> It is sometimes used colloquially to mean \"bug\"&nbsp;\u2014a very general term, unlike the scientific \"insect\". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation.{{sfn|Sokel|1956|pp = 203\u2013214}}{{sfn|Luke|1951|pp = 232\u2013245}} Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun {{lang|de|[[wikt:Verkehr|Verkehr]]|italic=no}} in the final sentence of \"Das Urteil\". Literally, {{lang|de|Verkehr|italic=no}} means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: \"At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge\".{{sfn|Kafka|1996|p = 75}} The double meaning of ''Verkehr'' is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of \"a violent ejaculation\".{{sfn|Brod|1960|p = 129}}{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 50}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Literary and cultural influence ===\n\nUnlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective.{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 4}} Shimon Sandbank, a professor, literary critic, and writer, identifies Kafka as having influenced [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]], [[J. M. Coetzee]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].{{sfn|Sandbank|1992|pp = 441\u2013443}} A ''Financial Times'' literary critic credits Kafka with influencing [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]],{{sfn|''Financial Times''|2009}} and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that [[J. D. Salinger]] loved to read Kafka's works.{{sfn|Silverman|1986|pp = 129\u2013130}} In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked {{lang|de|Der Process}} and {{lang|de|Das Schloss}} the second and ninth [[Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century|most significant German-language novels of the 20th century]].{{sfn|LiteraturHaus|1999}} Sandbank argues that despite Kafka's pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated.{{sfn|Sandbank|1992|pp = 441\u2013443}} Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at [[Binghamton University]] who specialises in Kafka's works, says Kafka's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture.{{sfn|Coker|2012}} Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka \"has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century\".{{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390\u2013408}} Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the \"century of Kafka\".{{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390\u2013408}}\n\nMichel-Andr\u00e9 Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the \"irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world\".{{sfn|Bossy|2001|p = 100}} His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka's universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as [[George Orwell]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].{{sfn|Bossy|2001|p = 100}}\n\nThe following are examples of works across a range of literary, musical, and dramatic genres which demonstrate the extent of cultural influence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Medium\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Remarks\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref\n|-\n| \"A Friend of Kafka\"\n| 1962\n| short story\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | by Nobel Prize winner [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], about a Yiddish actor called Jacques Kohn who said he knew Franz Kafka; in this story, according to Jacques Kohn, Kafka believed in the [[Golem]], a legendary creature from [[Jewish folklore]]\n| {{sfn|Singer|1970|p = 311}}\n|-\n| ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]''\n| 1962\n| film\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | the film's director, [[Orson Welles]], said, \"Say what you like, but The Trial is my greatest work, even greater than [[Citizen Kane]]\"\n| {{sfn|Adams|2002|pp = 140\u2013157}}{{sfn|Welles Net|1962}}\n<!-- -|-\n| ''The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny''\n| 1968\n| music\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | composer [[Frank Zappa]], in the liner notes of the [[Mothers of Invention]] album [[We're Only in It for the Money]], suggests reading the short story [[In the Penal Colony]] before listening to this track.\n| <ref>Mothers of Invention, We're only in it for the money.</ref> \u2013 -->\n|-\n| ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]''\n| 1970\n| film\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | partly inspired by \"[[The Metamorphosis]]\", where a white bigot wakes up as a black man\n| {{sfn|Elsaesser|2004|p = 117}}\n|-\n| ''[[Klassenverh\u00e4ltnisse]]''\n| 1984\n| film\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | film adaptation of ''[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]'' directed by [[Straub-Huillet]]\n|\n|-\n| ''Kafka-Fragmente, Op.&nbsp;24''\n| 1985\n| music\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | by Hungarian composer [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]] for soprano and violin, using fragments of Kafka's diary and letters\n| {{sfn|Opera Today|2010}}\n|-\n| ''[[Kafka's Dick]]''\n| 1986\n| play\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | by [[Alan Bennett]], in which the ghosts of Kafka, his father Hermann and Brod arrive at the home of an English insurance clerk (and Kafka aficionado) and his wife\n| {{sfn|Times Literary Supplement|2005}}\n<!-- -|-\n| ''[[Northern Exposure]]''\n| 1992\n| television series episode\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | in the season 3 episode \"Cicely\", Kafka finds himself in \"The Paris of the North\" to break his [[writers' block]].

Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.{{sfn|Steinhauer|1983|pp = 390\u2013408}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|pp = 140\u2013157}}{{sfn|Aizenberg|1986|pp = 11\u201319}}{{sfn|Strelka|1984|pp = 434\u2013444}}\n[[File:Kafka statue Prague.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jaroslav R\u00f3na]]'s bronze ''[[Statue of Franz Kafka]]'' in Prague|alt=The statue is a man with no head or arms, with another man sitting on his shoulders]]\n\nNumerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction.

This is similar to restrictions applicable to the [[Clark Medal]] in economics.

The agents' boss later arrives and holds a mini-tribunal in the room of K.'s neighbor, Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner. K. is not taken away, however, but left \"free\" and told to await instructions from the Committee of Affairs. He goes to work, and that night apologizes to Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner for the intrusion into her room. At the end of the conversation he suddenly kisses her.\n\nK. receives a phone call summoning him to court, and the coming Sunday is arranged as the date. No time is set, but the address is given to him. The address turns out to be a huge tenement building. K. has to explore to find the court, which turns out to be in the attic. The room is airless, shabby and crowded, and although he has no idea what he is charged with, or what authorizes the process, K. makes a long speech denigrating the whole process, including the agents who arrested him; during this speech an attendant's wife and a man engage in sexual activities. K. then returns home.\n\nK. later goes to visit the court again, although he has not been summoned, and finds that it is not in session. He instead talks with the attendant's wife, who attempts to seduce him into taking her away, and who gives him more information about the process and offers to help him. K. later goes with the attendant to a higher level of the attic where the shabby and airless offices of the court are housed.\n\nK. returns home to find Fr\u00e4ulein Montag, a lodger from another room, moving in with Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner. He suspects that this is to prevent him from pursuing his affair with the latter woman. Yet another lodger, Captain Lanz, appears to be in league with Montag.\n\nLater, in a store room at his own bank, K. discovers the two agents who arrested him being whipped by a flogger for asking K. for bribes and as a result of complaints K. made at court. K. tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the store room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the whipper and the two agents.\n\nK. is visited by his uncle, who was K.'s guardian. The uncle seems distressed by K.'s predicament. At first sympathetic, he becomes concerned that K. is underestimating the seriousness of the case. The uncle introduces K. to a lawyer, who is attended by Leni, a nurse, whom K.'s uncle suspects is the advocate's mistress. During the discussion it becomes clear how different this process is from regular legal proceedings: guilt is assumed, the bureaucracy running it is vast with many levels, and everything is secret, from the charge, to the rules of the court, to the authority behind the courts \u2013 even the identity of the judges at the higher levels. The attorney tells him that he can prepare a brief for K., but since the charge is unknown and the rules are unknown, it is difficult work. It also never may be read, but is still very important. The lawyer says that his most important task is to deal with powerful court officials behind the scenes. As they talk, the lawyer reveals that the Chief Clerk of the Court has been sitting hidden in the darkness of a corner. The Chief Clerk emerges to join the conversation, but K. is called away by Leni, who takes him to the next room, where she offers to help him and seduces him. They have a sexual encounter. Afterwards K. meets his uncle outside, who is angry, claiming that K.'s lack of respect has hurt K.'s case.\n\nK. visits the lawyer several times. The lawyer tells him incessantly how dire his situation is and tells many stories of other hopeless clients and of his behind-the-scenes efforts on behalf of these clients, and brags about his many connections. The brief is never completed. K.'s work at the bank deteriorates as he is consumed with worry about his case.\n\nK. is surprised by one of his bank clients, who tells K. that he is aware that K. is dealing with a trial. The client learned of K.'s case from Titorelli, a painter, who has dealings with the court and told the client about K.'s case. The client advises K. to go to Titorelli for advice. Titorelli lives in the attic of a tenement in a suburb on the opposite side of town from the court that K. visited. Three teenage girls taunt K. on the steps and tease him sexually. Titorelli turns out to be an official painter of portraits for the court (an inherited position), and has a deep understanding of the process. K. learns that, to Titorelli's knowledge, not a single defendant has ever been acquitted. He sets out K.'s options and offers to help K. with either. The options are: obtain a provisional verdict of innocence from the lower court, which can be overturned at any time by higher levels of the court, which would lead to re-initiation of the process; or curry favor with the lower judges to keep the process moving at a glacial pace. Titorelli has K. leave through a small back door, as the girls are blocking the door through which K. entered. To K.'s shock, the door opens into another warren of the court's offices \u2013 again shabby and airless.\n\nK. decides to take control of matters himself and visits his lawyer with the intention of dismissing him. At the lawyer's office he meets a downtrodden individual, Block, a client who offers K. some insight from a client's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of K. for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons K.'s opinion of his lawyer. (This chapter was left unfinished by the author.)\n\nK. is asked by the bank to show an Italian client around local places of cultural interest, but the Italian client, short of time, asks K. to take him only to the cathedral, setting a time to meet there. When the client does not show up, K. explores the cathedral, which is empty except for an old woman and a church official. K. notices a priest who seems to be preparing to give a sermon from a small second pulpit, and K. begins to leave, lest it begin and K. be compelled to stay for its entirety. Instead of giving a sermon, the priest calls out K.'s name. K. approaches the pulpit and the priest berates him for his attitude toward the trial and for seeking help, especially from women. K. asks him to come down and the two men walk inside the cathedral. The priest works for the court as a chaplain and tells K. a fable (which was published earlier as \"[[Before the Law]]\") that is meant to explain his situation. K. and the priest discuss the parable. The priest tells K. that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have interpreted it differently.\n\nOn the eve of K.'s thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. He has been waiting for them, and he offers little resistance \u2013 indeed the two men take direction from K. as they walk through town. K. leads them to a quarry where the two men place K's head on a discarded block. One of the men produces a double-edged butcher knife, and as the two men pass it back and forth between them, the narrator tells us that \"K. knew then precisely, that it would have been his duty to take the knife... and thrust it into himself.\" He does not take the knife. One of the men holds his shoulder and pulls him up and the other man stabs him in the heart and twists the knife twice. K.'s last words are: \"Like a dog!\".\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Josef K.''' \u2013 The tale's protagonist.\n* '''Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner''' \u2013 A boarder in the same house as Josef K.

Generally, there are five major perspectives<ref>Krieschel, p. 108\u2013110 {{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2018}}</ref>:\n* [[biographical]]\n* historical-critical: against the background of the social tensions in [[Austria-Hungary]] prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]]\n* [[religious]]: especially regarding Kafka\u2019s [[Jewish]] descent\n* [[psychoanalytical]]: ''The Trial'' as a symbol of the awareness and projection of an inner process (in German, the word ''Prozess'' can refer to both a trial and a process)\n* [[political]] and [[sociological]]: as a criticism of an autonomous and inhuman [[bureaucracy]] and of a lack of [[civil rights]]\n\nConcerning these categories, however, there is one important point that should not be overlooked. Although the diverse studies theorizing about the novel provide valuable insights, they are often impeded by the critics' eagerness to squeeze these insights into a frame which, ultimately, is beyond the novel's text.<ref>M.M\u00fcller /von Jagow p. 528 {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> This, by the way, is not a phenomenon unique to ''The Trial''. \nKafka\u2019s novel ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'' shows similar tendencies as well. Only later interpretations, e.g. by the German writer [[Martin Walser]], express an increasing demand for a strictly text-based view.<ref>Krieschel p. 111 {{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2018}}</ref> Current works, e.g. by the contemporary literary critic [[Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt]], go into the same direction.\n\n===Relations to other texts by Kafka===\nThe myth of guilt and judgement discussed in ''The Trial'' has its cultural roots in the [[Hasidic]] tradition, where tales of plaintiff and defendant, heavenly judgement and punishment, unfathomable authorities and obscure charges are not uncommon.\n\nFirst of all, there are many parallels between Kafka\u2019s ''The Trial'' and his other major novel, ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]''. In both novels, the protagonist wanders through a labyrinth that seems to be designed to make him fail or even seems to have no relation to him at all.<ref>Louis Begley p. 297 {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> Ill, bedridden men explain the system in lengthy terms. Erotically charged female figures turn to the protagonist in a demanding way.\n\nWritten around the same time, in October 1914, the short story ''[[In the Penal Colony]]'' bears close resemblance to ''The Trial''. In both cases, the delinquent does not know what he is charged with. A single person \u2013 an officer with a gruesome machine \u2013 seems to be accuser, judge and executioner in one.\n\nThe idea that a single executioner could be enough to arbitrarily replace the entire court is exactly what Josef K. is frightened about.<ref>Cerstin Urban p. 43. {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, Kafka wrote the parable ''[[The Knock at the Manor Gate]]'', which almost appears to be an abridged version of ''The Trial''. An action is brought out of nowhere or without any reason and it ends in a disastrous entanglement and inevitable punishment. Fate strikes the narrator by chance in the middle of everyday life. Kafka scholar Ralf Sudau states that \"[a] sense of punishment or perhaps an unconscious demand for punishment [...] and a tragic or absurd downfall are signalled in this context.\" (''\"Ein Vorgef\u00fchl von Strafe oder vielleicht ein unbewu\u00dftes Strafverlangen [...] und ein tragischer oder absurder Untergang werden dabei signalisiert.\"'')\n\n=== Individual aspects ===\n==== Short text analysis ====\nFor Josef K., the court is an anonymous and unfamiliar power. Unlike the courthouse in the Palace of Justice, this court is characterized by widely branched, impenetrable hierarchies. There seems to be an infinite number of instances and K. only gets in contact with the lowest ones. In spite of his efforts, K. is unable to discover the court's nature. The clergyman\u2019s words in the cathedral (\u201cThe court doesn\u2019t want anything from you. It takes you in when you come and sets you free when you leave\u201d) don\u2019t provide any help. Could K. simply evade the court? His reality looks different. For K., the court remains mysterious and not really explicable.\n\nJosef K. has to confront a cold world that puts him off. While the main character in Kafka\u2019s parable [[Before the Law]] is asking flees for help, Josef K. turns to women, a painter and advocates to help him. However, they only feign their influence and keep him waiting. In this way, the people K. is asking for help act like the door-keeper in said parable. They all accept presents from the main character, but only to put him off and to not disillusion him in believing that acting in this way will help his cause.\n\n==== Diversity of interpretations ====\nLike in Kafka's novel ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', the range of manifold interpretations may only be covered selectively and not conclusively. \n\nOne possible interpretative approach is to read the novel autobiographically. This claim is supported by the similarities in the initials of ''Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner'' and ''Felice Bauer''. [[Elias Canetti]] points out that the intensely detailed description of the court system hints at Kafka\u2019s work as an insurance lawyer.<ref>von Jagow/Jahrhaus/Hiebel reference to Canetti: ''Der andere Prozess.'' p. 458. {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> \n\n[[Theodor W. Adorno]] takes the opposite view. According to him, ''The Trial'' does not tell the story of an individual fate but rather contains wide-reaching political and visionary aspects and can be read as a vision predicting the Nazi terror.<ref>von Jagow/Jahrhaus/Hiebel reference to Adorno: ''Aufzeichnungen zu Kafka.'' p. 459. {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> \n\nGerman scholar Claus Hebell offers a synthesis of these two positions and demonstrates that the negotiating strategy used by the bureaucratic court system during the process to demoralize Kafka is reminiscent of the deficiencies in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire\u2019s]] judicial system.<ref>Claus Hebell: ''Rechtstheoretische und geistesgeschichtliche Voraussetzungen f\u00fcr das Werk Franz Kafkas, analysiert an dem Roman \u201eDer Proze\u00df\u201c.''

This interweaving between K. and the court system increasingly intensifies throughout the novel. Towards the end of ''The Trial'', K. realizes that everything that is happening stems from his inner self<ref>Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt, p. 417. {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> and is the result of feelings of guilt and fantasies of punishment.\n\nWorth mentioning is also the dreamlike component of the events: Like in a dream, K.'s interior and exterior world intermingle.<ref>von Jagow/Jahrhaus/Hiebel, p. 462. {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> A transition from the fantastic-realistic to the allegorical-psychological level can be made out. Even K.\u2019s working environment is increasingly undermined by the fantastic, dreamlike world. It is, for example, a work order that leads to K.\u2019s encounter with the priest.\n\n'''Sexual references'''\n\nThe protagonist's feelings of guilt are likely to be rooted in the views on sexuality that prevailed at the beginning of the 20th century and are mirrored in the works of [[Sigmund Freud]]. According to [[Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt]], \"sexuality and K.'s trial are connected in remarkable ways.\" Women are portrayed as [[siren (Mythology)|sirens]], the representatives of the court as lecherous. K. himself cannot control his lust for Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner. \n\nFurthermore, critics identified homoerotic elements in the text, for instance K.'s ironic and almost loving view of his director. Elegant or tight-fitting clothes on men are mentioned several times throughout the novel. The half-naked flogger punishing the officers Willem and Franz, who are naked as well, resembles [[BDSM|sadomasochism]].\n\n''' ''The Trial'' as a humorous story'''\n\nAccording to Kafka's friends, he laughed out loud several times while reading from his book.<ref>Max Brod's ''Franz Kafka. Eine Biographie'' (1974 edition ''\u00dcber Franz Kafka'')</ref> It is thus reasonable to look for humorous aspects in ''The Trial'' despite its dark and serious essence. \n\nThis phenomenon is also addressed by Kafka biographer [[Reiner Stach]]: '' The Trial'' \"is gruesome in its entirety, but comical in its details.\"<ref>Reiner Stach/Entscheidungen p. 554 {{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref> The judges read porn magazines instead of law books and send for women as if they were ordering a splendid meal on a tray. The executioners look like ageing tenors. Due to a hole in the floor of one of the courtrooms, an advocate's leg protrudes into the room below from time to time.\n\n==Film adaptations==\n* In the [[The Trial (1962 film)|1962 film adaptation]] by [[Orson Welles]], Josef K. is played by [[Anthony Perkins]] and The Advocate by Welles himself.\n* [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1985 film ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' contains a scene adapted from \"Before the Law\", in which the protagonist is trying to get into a nightclub called Club Berlin.\n* The 1993 film of ''[[The Trial (1993 film)|The Trial]]'' was based on [[Harold Pinter]]'s screenplay adaptation and starred [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Josef K and [[Anthony Hopkins]] as The Priest.\n* The 2017 science fiction film [[Blade Runner 2049]] features a protagonist named Agent K, who is also referred to as \"Joe\" .<ref>https://medium.com/@_tomchristie/inside-the-kaleidoscope-mirrored-heart-of-blade-runner-2049-62ee229acc14</ref>\n\n==Radio adaptations==\n* On May 19, 1946, ''[[Columbia Workshop]]'' broadcast an adaptation of ''The Trial'' by [[Davidson Taylor]] with an original musical score by [[Bernard Herrmann]] and starring [[Karl Swenson]] as Joseph K.<ref>http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Columbia-Workshop.html</ref>\n* In 1982, [[Mike Gwilym]] starred as Josef K with [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Leni in an adaptation on [[BBC Radio 4]] dramatised for radio by [[Hanif Kureishi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04k6p4c|title=BBC Radio 4 Extra \u2013 Franz Kafka \u2013 ''The Trial''|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n* [[Sam Troughton]] starred as Joseph Kay in a new adaptation by [[Mark Ravenhill]] titled ''The Process'' directed by [[Polly Thomas]] and broadcast on 10 May 2015 on [[BBC Radio 3]]'s ''Drama on 3'' program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05tpnkk|title=BBC Radio 3 \u2013 Drama on 3, ''The Process''|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Stage adaptations==\n* The writer and director [[Steven Berkoff]] adapted several of Kafka's novels into plays and directed them for stage.

One of Kafka's best-known works, ''The Metamorphosis'' tells the story of salesman Gregor Samsa who wakes one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect and subsequently struggling to adjust to this new condition. The novella has been widely discussed among literary critics, with differing interpretations being offered. \n\n==Plot==\n===Part I===\nOne day, Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up to find himself transformed into a giant insect (the most common translation of the German description ''ungeheures Ungeziefer'', literally \"monstrous vermin\"). He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is. As he looks at the wall clock, he notices that he has overslept and missed his train for work. He ponders the consequences of this delay. Gregor becomes annoyed at how his boss never accepts excuses or explanations from any of his employees no matter how hard-working they are, displaying an apparent lack of trusting abilities. Gregor's mother knocks on the door, and he answers her. She is concerned for Gregor because he is late for work, which is unorthodox for him. Gregor answers his mother and realizes that his voice has changed, but his answer is short, so his mother does not notice. His sister, Grete, to whom he is very close, then whispers through the door and begs him to open it. He tries to get out of bed but is incapable of moving his body. While trying to move, he finds that his office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him. He finally rocks his body to the floor and calls out that he will open the door shortly.\n\nOffended by Gregor's delayed response in opening the door, the clerk warns him of the consequences of missing work. He adds that Gregor's recent performance has been unsatisfactory. Gregor disagrees and tells him that he will open the door shortly. Nobody on the other side of the door has understood a single word he had uttered as Gregor's voice has also transformed, and they conclude that he is seriously ill. Finally, Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth. He apologizes to the office manager for the delay. Horrified by Gregor's appearance, his mother faints, and the manager bolts out of the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with him, but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway, and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.\n\n===Part II===\nGregor awakens and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk, once one of his favorites. He settles himself under a couch. The next morning, his sister comes in, sees that he has not touched the milk, takes it away and presents him with different types of food. Gregor happily eats the rotten food and leaves the fresh food untouched. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can't provide them any help. Gregor had plans of sending Grete to the conservatory to pursue violin lessons, something everyone else\u2014including Grete\u2014considered a dream. His inability to provide for his family, coupled with his speechlessness, greatly reduce his thought processes. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father will not let her.\n\nGregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor's new pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and fur muff. Gregor's mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete angrily calls out to Gregor\u2014the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. He encounters his father, who has just returned home from work. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one of them sinks into a sensitive spot in his back and remains lodged there, paralyzing his movements for a month and damaging him permanently. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured.\n\n===Part III===\nOne evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor's door open while three lodgers, whom the family has taken on for additional income, lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor\u2014who usually takes care to avoid crossing paths with anyone in the flat\u2014creeps out of his bedroom to listen in the midst of his depression and resultant detachment. The lodgers, who initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the lodgers spots Gregor, and the rest become alarmed. Gregor's father tries to shove the lodgers back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment.\n\nGrete, who has by now become tired of taking care of Gregor and is realizing the burden his existence puts on each one in the family, tells her parents they must get rid of Gregor, or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does, in fact, understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies, though it is not clear whether the cause of his death was suicide or natural causes.\n\nUpon discovering Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor's body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. They decide to move to a smaller apartment to further save money, an act they were unable to carry out in Gregor's presence. During this short trip, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa realize that, in spite of going through hardships which have brought an amount of paleness to her face, Grete appears to have grown up into a pretty and well-figured lady, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Gregor Samsa===\n{{redirect|Gregor Samsa}}\nGregor is the main character of the story. He works as a traveling salesman in order to provide money for his sister and parents. He wakes up one morning finding himself transformed into an insect. After the metamorphosis, Gregor becomes unable to work and is confined to his room for most of the remainder of the story. This prompts his family to begin working once again. Gregor is depicted as isolated from society and often misunderstands the true intentions of others.\n\nThe name \"Gregor Samsa\" appears to derive partly from literary works Kafka had read. A character in ''The Story of Young Renate Fuchs'', by German-Jewish novelist [[Jakob Wassermann]] (1873\u20131934), is named Gregor Samassa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/die-geschichte-der-jungen-renate-fuchs-6449/14|title=Die Geschichte der jungen Renate Fuchs von Jakob Wassermann - Text im Projekt Gutenberg|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg,|website=gutenberg.spiegel.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref> The Viennese author [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], whose sexual imagination gave rise to the idea of [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], is also an influence. Sacher-Masoch wrote ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' (1870), a novel whose hero assumes the name Gregor at one point. A \"Venus in furs\" literally recurs in ''The Metamorphosis'' in the picture that Gregor Samsa has hung on his bedroom wall.<ref>Kafka (1996, 3).</ref>\n\n===Grete Samsa===\nGrete is Gregor's younger sister, who becomes his caretaker after his metamorphosis. Initially Grete and Gregor have a close relationship, but this quickly fades. While Grete initially volunteers to feed him and clean his room, she grows increasingly impatient with the burden and begins to leave his room in disarray out of spite. Her initial decision to take care of Gregor may have come from a desire to contribute and be useful to the family, since she becomes angry and upset when the mother cleans his room, and it is made clear that Grete is disgusted by Gregor; she could not enter Gregor's room without opening the window first because of the nausea he caused her, and leaves without doing anything if Gregor is in plain sight. She plays the violin and dreams of going to the conservatory, a dream Gregor had intended to make happen; Gregor had planned on making the announcement on Christmas Day. To help provide an income for the family after Gregor's transformation, she starts working as a salesgirl. Grete is also the first to suggest getting rid of Gregor, which causes Gregor to plan his own death. At the end of the story, Grete's parents realize that she has become beautiful and full-figured and decide to consider finding her a husband.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-metamorphosis/characters/grete-samsa|title=The character of Grete Samsa in The Metamorphosis from LitCharts {{!}} The creators of SparkNotes|work=LitCharts|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Mr. Samsa===\nMr. Samsa is Gregor's father. After the metamorphosis, he is forced to return to work in order to support the family financially. His attitude towards his son is harsh; he regards the transformed Gregor with disgust and possibly even fear, and he attacks him on multiple occasions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-metamorphosis/characters/father|title=The character of Father in The Metamorphosis from LitCharts {{!}} The creators of SparkNotes|work=LitCharts|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Mrs. Samsa===\nMrs. Samsa is Grete and Gregor's mother. She is initially shocked at Gregor's transformation; however, she wants to enter his room. This proves too much for her, thus giving rise to a conflict between her maternal impulse and sympathy, and her fear and revulsion at Gregor's new form.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===The Charwoman===\nThe Charwoman is an old lady who is employed by the Samsa family to help take care of their household duties. Apart from Grete and her father, she is the only person who is in close contact with Gregor. She is the one who notices that Gregor had died and disposes of his body.\n\n== Interpretation ==\nLike most Kafka works, ''The Metamorphosis'' tends to entail the use of a religious ([[Max Brod]]) or psychological interpretation by most of its interpreters. It has been particularly common to read the story as an expression of Kafka\u2019s father complex, as was first done by Charles Neider in his ''The Frozen Sea: A Study of Franz Kafka'' (1948). Besides the [[Psychology|psychological]] approach, interpretations focusing on [[Sociology|sociological]] aspects which see the Samsa family as a portrayal of general social circumstances, have gained a large following as well.<ref>Abraham, Ulf. ''Franz Kafka: Die Verwandlung.'' Diesterweg, 1993. {{ISBN|3-425-06172-0}}.</ref> \n\n[[Vladimir Nabokov]] rejected such interpretations, noting that they do not live up to Kafka\u2019s art. He instead chose an interpretation guided by the artistic detail but categorically excluded any and all attempts at deciphering a [[Symbol|symbolical]] or [[Allegory|allegorical]] level of meaning. Arguing against the popular father complex theory, he observed that it is the sister, more so than the father, who should be considered the cruelest person in the story, as she is the one backstabbing Gregor. As the central narrative theme he makes out the artist\u2019s struggle for existence in a society replete with philistines that destroys him step by step. Commenting on Kafka\u2019s style, he writes: \u201cThe transparency of his style underlines the dark richness of his fantasy world. Contrast and uniformity, style and the depicted, portrayal and fable are seamlessly intertwined\u201d (german: \u201eDie Durchsichtigkeit seines Stils betont den dunklen Reichtum seiner Phantasiewelt. Gegensatz und Einheitlichkeit, Stil und Dargestelltes, Darstellung und Fabel sind in vollkommener Weise ineinander verwoben.\u201c)<ref>Nabokov, Vladimir V. ''Die Kunst des Lesens: Meisterwerke der europ\u00e4ischen Literatur. Austen - Dickens - Flaubert - Stevenson - Proust - Kafka - Joyce.'' FISCHER Taschenbuch, 1991, pp. 313\u2013352. {{ISBN|3-596-10495-5}}.</ref> \n\nIn 1989, Nina Pelikan Straus wrote a feminist interpretation of Metamorphosis, bringing to the forefront the transformation of the main character Gregor's sister, Grete, and foregrounding the family and, particularly, younger sister's transformation in the story. Traditionally, critics of Metamorphosis have underplayed the fact that the story is not only about Gregor but also his family and especially, Grete's metamorphosis as it is mainly Grete, woman, daughter, sister, on whom the social and psychoanalytic resonances of the text depend <ref>Pelikan Straus, Nina. ''Transforming Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis'' Signs, 14:3, (Spring, 1989), The University of Chicago Press, pp. 651-667.</ref> \n\nIn 1999, Gerhard Rieck pointed out that Gregor and his sister Grete form a pair, which is typical for many of Kafka\u2019s texts: It is made up of one passive, rather austere person and another active, more libidinal person. The appearance of figures with such almost irreconcilable personalities who form couples in Kafka\u2019s works has been evident since he wrote his short story [[Description of a Struggle]] (e.g. the narrator/young man and his \u201cacquaintance\u201d). They also appear in [[The Judgement]] (Georg and his friend in Russia), in all three of his novels (e.g. Robinson and Delamarche in [[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]) as well as in his short stories [[A Country Doctor (short story)|A Country Doctor]] (the country doctor and the groom) and [[A Hunger Artist]] (the hunger artist and the panther). Rieck views these pairs as parts of one single person (hence the similarity between the names Gregor and Grete), and in the final analysis as the two determining components of the author\u2019s personality. Not only in Kafka\u2019s life but also in his oeuvre does Rieck see the description of a fight between these two parts.<ref>Rieck, Gerhard. ''Kafka konkret \u2013 Das Trauma ein Leben. Wiederholungsmotive im Werk als Grundlage einer psychologischen Deutung.'' K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann, 1999, pp. 104\u2013125. {{ISBN|978-3-8260-1623-3}}.</ref> \n\n[[Reiner Stach]] argued in 2004 that no elucidating comments were needed to illustrate the story and that it was convincing by itself, self-contained, even absolute. He believes that there is no doubt the story would have been admitted to the canon of [[world literature]] even if we had known nothing about its author.<ref>Stach, Reiner. ''Kafka. Die Jahre der Entscheidungen'', p. 221.</ref> \n\nAccording to [[Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt]] (2005), the figure of the vermin becomes a drastic expression of Gregor Samsa's deprived existence. Reduced to carrying out his professional responsibilities, anxious to guarantee his advancement and vexed with the fear of making commercial mistakes, he is the creature of a functionalistic professional life.<ref> Alt, Peter-Andr\u00e9. ''Franz Kafka: Der Ewige Sohn. Eine Biographie.'' C.H.Beck, 2008 , p. 336.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Ralf Sudau took the view that particular attention should be paid to the motifs of self-abnegation and disregard for reality. Gregor\u2019s earlier behavior was characterized by self-renunciation and his pride in being able to provide a secure and leisured existence for his family. When he finds himself in a situation where he himself is in need of attention and assistance and in danger of becoming a parasite, he doesn\u2019t want to admit this new role to himself and be disappointed by the treatment he receives from his family, which is becoming more and more careless and even hostile over time. According to Sundau, Gregor is self-denyingly hiding his nauseating appearance under the canap\u00e9 and gradually famishing, thus pretty much complying with the more or less blatant wish of his family. His gradual [[emaciation]] and \u201cself-reduction\u201d shows signs of a fatal [[hunger strike]] (which on the part of Gregor is unconscious and unsuccessful, on the part of his family not understood or ignored).  Sudau (p. 163-164) also lists the names of selected interpreters of ''The Metamorphosis'' (e.g. Beicken, Sokel, Sautermeister and Schwarz). According to them, the narrative is a metaphor for the suffering resulting from leprosy, an escape into the disease or a symptom onset, an image of an existence which is defaced by the career, or a revealing staging which cracks the veneer and superficiality of everyday circumstances and exposes its cruel essence. He further notes that Kafka\u2019s representational style is on one hand characterized by an idiosyncratic interpenetration of realism and fantasy, a worldly mind, rationality and clarity of observation, and on the other hand by folly, outlandishness and fallacy. He also points to the grotesque and tragicomical, silent film-like elements.<ref>Sudau, Ralf. ''Franz Kafka: Kurze Prosa / Erz\u00e4hlungen''. Klett, 2007, pp. 158-162.</ref>\n\nFernando Bermejo-Rubio (2012) argued that the story is often viewed unjustly as inconclusive. He derives his interpretative approach from the fact that the descriptions of Gregor and his family environment in ''The Metamorphosis'' contradict each other. Diametrically opposed versions exist of Gregor\u2019s back, his voice, of whether he is ill or already undergoing the metamorphosis, whether he is dreaming or not, which treatment he deserves, of his moral point of view (false accusations made by Grete) and whether his family is blameless or not. Bermejo-Rubio emphasizes that Kafka ordered in 1915 that there should be no illustration of Gregor. He argues that it is exactly this absence of a visual narrator that is essential for Kafka\u2019s project, for he who depicts Gregor would stylize himself as an omniscient narrator. Another reason why Kafka opposed such an illustration is that the reader should not be biased in any way before his reading process was getting under way. That the descriptions are not compatible with each other is indicative of the fact that the opening statement is not to be trusted. If the reader isn\u2019t hoodwinked by the first sentence and still thinks of Gregor as a human being, he will view the story as conclusive and realize that Gregor is a victim of his own degeneration.<ref>Bermejo-Rubio, Fernando: \u201cTruth and Lies about Gregor Samsa.

She is the character the title is directed at. Gregor\u2019s metamorphosis is followed by him languishing and ultimately dying. Grete, by contrast, has matured as a result of the new family circumstances and assumed responsibility. In the end \u2013 after the brother\u2019s death \u2013 the parents also notice that their daughter, \u201cwho was getting more animated all the time, had blossomed [\u2026] into a beautiful and voluptuous young woman\u201d, and want to look for a partner for her. From this standpoint, Grete\u2019s transition, her metamorphosis from a girl into a woman, is the subtextual theme of the story.<ref>Dr\u00fcke, Volker. \u201cNeue Pl\u00e4ne F\u00fcr Grete Samsa.\u201d ''\u00dcbergangsgeschichten.

This is achieved from the construction of sentences in the original German, where the verbs of subordinate clauses are put at the end. For example, in the opening sentence, it is the final word, ''verwandelt'', that indicates transformation:\n\n{{quote|''Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Tr\u00e4umen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt.'' }}\n{{quote|As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect-like creature. }}\n\nThese constructions are not directly replicable in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the effect of the original text.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kafka, Franz |year=1996|title=The Metamorphosis and Other Stories |isbn=1-56619-969-7|page= xi}}</ref>\n\nEnglish translators have often sought to render the word ''Ungeziefer'' as \"insect\", but this is not strictly accurate. In [[Middle High German]], ''Ungeziefer'' literally means \"unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice\"<ref>{{cite book|title='Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Deutschen'|year=1993|publisher=Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag|location=Munich|isbn=3423325119|page=1486}}</ref> and is sometimes used colloquially to mean \"bug\"&nbsp;\u2013 a very general term, unlike the scientific sounding \"insect\". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. The phrasing used by [[Joachim Neugroschel]]<ref>{{ISBN|0-684-80070-5}}</ref> is: \"Gregor Samsa found himself, in his bed, transformed into a monstrous vermin\",{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} whereas David Wyllie says\" \"transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kafka|first=Franz|title=Metamorphosis|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5200/5200-h/5200-h.htm|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in Kafka's letter to his publisher of 25 October 1915, in which he discusses his concern about the cover illustration for the first edition, he uses the term ''Insekt'', saying: \"The insect itself is not to be drawn. It is not even to be seen from a distance.\"<ref>[http://www.literature.at/elib/www/wiki/index.php/Briefe_und_Tageb%C3%BCcher_1915_%28Franz_Kafka%29#1915-10-11.2C_Prag:_An_den_Kurt_Wolff_Verlag_.28G.H.Meyer.29 Briefe und Tageb\u00fccher 1915 (Franz Kafka) \u2014 ELibraryAustria<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''Ungeziefer'' has sometimes been translated as \"[[cockroach]]\", \"[[dung beetle]]\", \"[[beetle]]\", and other highly specific terms. The term \"dung beetle\" or ''Mistk\u00e4fer'' is, in fact, used by the cleaning lady near the end of the story, but it is not used in the narration: \"''At first, she also called him to her with words which she presumably thought were friendly, like \u2018Come here for a bit, old dung beetle!\u2019 or \u2018Hey, look at the old dung beetle!\u2019''\" ''Ungeziefer'' also denotes a sense of separation between himself and his environment: he is unclean and must therefore be secluded.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[Vladimir Nabokov]], who was a [[lepidopterist]] as well as a writer and literary critic, insisted that Gregor was not a cockroach, but a beetle with wings under his shell, and capable of flight. Nabokov left a sketch annotated, \"just over three feet long\", on the opening page of his (heavily corrected) English teaching copy. In his accompanying lecture notes, Nabokov discusses the type of insect Gregor has been transformed into, concluding that Gregor \"is not, technically, a dung beetle. He is merely a big beetle\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Nabokov | first = Vladimir | authorlink = Vladimir Nabokov | coauthors = | title = Lectures on Literature | publisher = Harvest | year = 1980 | location = New York, New York | pages = 260}}</ref>\n\n== English translations ==\n* 1933: [[Willa Muir]] and [[Edwin Muir]]\n* 1972: Stanley Corngold\n* 1993: [[Joachim Neugroschel]]\n* 1996: Stanley Appelbaum\n* 1999: Ian Johnston (public domain)\n** 2006: audio by David Barnes\n** 2012: audio by David Richardson\n** 2014: audio by Bob Neufeld\n* 2002: David Wyllie\n* 2007: [[Michael Hofmann]] \n* 2009: Joyce Crick \n* 2009: William Aaltonen\n* 2014: Christopher Moncrieff \n* 2014: [[Susan Bernofsky]]\n** 2014: audio by [[Edoardo Ballerini]]\n* 2014: John R.

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the [[Old Master]]s and the first of the moderns.  He was also one of the great contemporary [[portrait]]ists.<ref name = \"HCC\">[http://medicalalumni.org/historicalcpc/home/ Historical Clinicopathological Conference (2017)] University of Maryland School of Medicine, retrieved January 27, 2017.</ref>\n\nHe was born to a modest family in 1746 in the village of [[Fuendetodos]] in [[Aragon]]. He studied painting from age 14 under [[Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n|Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Martinez]] and moved to Madrid to study with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]. He married [[Josefa Bayeu]] in 1773; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and [[Rococo]] style [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] designed for the royal palace.\n\nGoya was guarded, and although letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He suffered a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him deaf. Sick and disillusioned, after 1793 his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year [[Manuel Godoy]] made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799 Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara, the then-highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In 1801 he painted ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nIn 1807 [[Napoleon]] led the French army into the [[Peninsular War]] against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not vocalise his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his ''[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]'' series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''. Other works from his mid-period include the ''[[Los Caprichos|Caprichos]]'' and ''[[Los Disparates]]'' etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with [[Yard with Lunatics|insanity]], [[The Madhouse|mental asylums]], [[Witches' Flight|witches]], [[The Bewitched Man|fantastical creatures]] and [[The Inquisition Tribunal|religious]] and [[The Junta of the Philippines|political]] corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\n\nHis late period culminates with the ''[[Black Paintings]]'' of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the [[Quinta del Sordo]] (''House of the Deaf Man'') where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of [[Bordeaux]], accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, [[La Leocadia|Leocadia Weiss]], who may or may not have been his lover. There he completed his ''[[La Tauromaquia]]'' series and a number of other, major, canvases. Following a stroke which left him paralyzed on his right side, and suffering failing eyesight and poor access to painting materials, he died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82. His body was later re-interred in the [[Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida|Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida]] in Madrid.\n\n==Early years (1746\u20131771)==\n[[File:Casa natal de Francisco Goya, Fuendetodos, Zaragoza, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-01-08, DD 06.JPG|left|thumb|220px|Birth house of Francisco Goya, Fuendetodos, Zaragoza]]\nFrancisco Goya was born in [[Fuendetodos]], [[Arag\u00f3n]], Spain, on 30 March 1746 to Jos\u00e9 Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador.

His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics.

Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of [[El Escorial]] and the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|Palacio Real del Pardo]], the residences of the Spanish monarchs. While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are  mostly popularist in a [[rococo]] style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention.<ref name=\"hh7\">Hagen & Hagen, 7</ref>\n\nThe cartoons were not his only royal commissions, and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and Vel\u00e1zquez.

Some of the larger cartoons, such as ''The Wedding'', were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength. Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal.<ref>Hughes (2004), 130</ref> However, he found the format limiting, as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture, and was unsuited to the [[impasto]] and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing]] techniques he was by then applying to his painted works.

The following year he became First Court Painter, with a salary of 50,000 [[Spanish real|reales]] and an allowance of 500 [[ducat]]s for a coach. He painted portraits of the king and the queen, and the Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel de Godoy]] and many other nobles. These portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter; his ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'' is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family.{{efn-ua|\"Even if one takes into consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic to the point of eccentricity, Goya's portrait still remains unique in its drastic description of human bankruptcy\". Licht (1979), 68}} Modern interpreters view the portrait as satirical; it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of Charles IV. Under his reign his wife [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Louisa]] was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait. From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay.\n\n[[File:Francisco de Goya - Godoy como general - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy]]'', 1801.

In 1801 he painted  Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief [[War of the Oranges]] against Portugal. The two were friends, even if Goya's ''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy|1801 portrait]]'' is usually seen as satire. Yet even after Godoy's fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms.

After the restoration of the Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in 1814, Goya denied any involvement with the French. By the time of his wife Josefa's death in 1812, he was painting ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', and preparing the series of etchings later known as ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' (''Los desastres de la guerra''). Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 but relations with Goya were not cordial.

This interpretation supports the statistical needs of experimental scientists and pollsters; probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion).  It does not support all needs; gamblers typically require estimates of the odds without experiments.\n\nThe development of the frequentist account was motivated by the problems and paradoxes of the previously dominant viewpoint, the [[Classical definition of probability|classical interpretation]].  In the classical interpretation, probability was defined in terms of the [[principle of indifference]], based on the natural symmetry of a problem, so, ''e.g.'' the probabilities of dice games arise from the natural symmetric 6-sidedness of the cube.  This classical interpretation stumbled at any statistical problem that has no natural symmetry for reasoning.\n\n==Definition==\nIn the frequentist interpretation, probabilities are discussed only when dealing with well-defined [[experiment (probability theory)|random experiments]] (or random samples).<ref name=Neyman>{{cite journal\n | last = Neyman | first = Jerzy\n | title = Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability\n | journal = Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A \n | volume = 236 | pages = 333\u2013380 | date = 30 August 1937 \n | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1937.0005| url = http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roypta/236/767/333.full.pdf}}  Neyman's derivation of confidence intervals embraced the measure theoretic axioms of probability published by Kolmogorov a few years previously and referenced the subjective (Bayesian) probability definitions of Jeffreys published earlier in the decade.  Neyman defined frequentist probability (under the name classical) and stated the need for randomness in the repeated samples or trials.  He accepted in principle the possibility of multiple competing theories of probability while expressing several specific reservations about the existing alternative probability interpretation.</ref>  The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the [[sample space]] of the experiment. An [[event (probability theory)|event]] is defined as a particular [[subset]] of the sample space to be considered. For any given event, only one of two possibilities may hold: it occurs or it does not.  The [[relative frequency]] of occurrence of an event, observed in a number of repetitions of the experiment, is a measure of the '''probability''' of that event.  This is the core conception of probability in the frequentist interpretation.\n\nThus, if <math>n_t</math> is the total number of trials and <math>n_x</math> is the number of trials where the event <math>x</math> occurred, the probability <math>P(x)</math> of the event occurring will be approximated by the relative frequency as follows:\n\n:<math>P(x) \\approx \\frac{n_x}{n_t}.</math>\n\nClearly, as the number of trials is increased, one might expect the relative frequency to become a better approximation of a \"true frequency\".\n\nA claim of the frequentist approach is that in the \"long run,\" as the number of trials approaches infinity, the relative frequency will converge ''exactly'' to the true probability:<ref name=Mises>von Mises, Richard (1939) ''Probability, Statistics, and Truth'' (in German) (English translation, 1981: Dover Publications; 2 Revised edition. {{ISBN|0486242145}})  (p.14)</ref>\n\n:<math>P(x) = \\lim_{n_t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{n_x}{n_t}.</math>\n\n== Scope ==\n\nThe frequentist interpretation is a philosophical approach to the definition and use of probabilities; it is one of several such approaches.  It does not claim to capture all connotations of the concept 'probable' in colloquial speech of natural languages.\n\nAs an interpretation, it is not in conflict with the mathematical axiomatization of probability theory; rather, it provides guidance for how to apply mathematical probability theory to real-world situations. It offers distinct guidance in the construction and design of practical experiments, especially when contrasted with the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian interpretation]].  As to whether this guidance is useful, or is apt to mis-interpretation, has been a source of controversy. Particularly when the frequency interpretation of probability is mistakenly assumed to be the only possible basis for [[frequentist inference]].  So, for example, a list of mis-interpretations of the meaning of [[p-values]] accompanies the article on p-values; controversies are detailed in the article on [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Controversy|statistical hypothesis testing]]. The [[Jeffreys\u2013Lindley paradox]] shows how different interpretations, applied to the same data set, can lead to different conclusions about the 'statistical significance' of a result.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAs [[William Feller]] noted:<ref>[[William Feller]] (1957), ''An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Vol. 1'', page 4</ref>\n{{Quote|There is no place in our system for speculations concerning the probability that the [[sunrise problem|sun will rise tomorrow]]. Before speaking of it we should have to agree on an (idealized) model which would presumably run along the lines \"out of infinitely many worlds one is selected at random...\" Little imagination is required to construct such a model, but it appears both uninteresting and meaningless.}}\n\nFeller's comment was criticism of Laplace, who published a solution to the sunrise problem using an alternative probability interpretation.  Despite Laplace's explicit and immediate disclaimer in the source, based on expertise in astronomy as well as probability, two centuries of criticism have followed.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of probability}}\nThe frequentist view may have been foreshadowed by [[Aristotle]], in ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'',<ref name=\"keynesVIII\">[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes, John Maynard]]; ''A Treatise on Probability'' (1921), Chapter VIII \u201cThe Frequency Theory of Probability\u201d.</ref> when he wrote:\n\n{{Quote|the probable is that which for the most part happens<ref name=\"aristorhetor\">''Rhetoric'' Bk 1 Ch 2; discussed in J.

L. Hachette, Paris.  [https://archive.org/details/expositiondelat00courgoog archive.org]</ref> and [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]] introduced the frequentist view.  [[John Venn|Venn]] provided a thorough exposition (''The Logic of Chance: An Essay on the Foundations and Province of the Theory of Probability'' (published editions in 1866, 1876, 1888))<ref name=Venn/> two decades later.  These were further supported by the publications of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]].  By the end of the 19th century the frequentist interpretation was well established and perhaps dominant in the sciences.<ref name=Gig89/>  The following generation established the tools of classical inferential statistics (significance testing, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) all based on frequentist probability.\n\nAlternatively,<ref>{{cite book | last = Hald | first = Anders | title = A history of parametric statistical inference from Bernoulli to Fisher, 1713 to 1935 | publisher = Anders Hald, Department of applied Mathematics and Statistics, University of Copenhagen | location = K\u00f8benhavn | year = 2004 | isbn = 87-7834-628-2 | pages = 11\u201312}}</ref> [[Jacob Bernoulli]] (AKA James or Jacques) understood the concept of frequentist probability and published a critical proof (the weak law of large numbers) posthumously in ''1713''.

The sample ratio allowed Bernoulli to infer the ratio in the urn, with tighter bounds as the number of samples increased.  Historians can interpret the example as classical, frequentist or subjective probability.  David says, \"James has definitely started here the controversy on inverse probability...\"  Bernoulli wrote generations before Bayes, LaPlace and Gauss.  The controversy continues.</ref>  [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] used frequentist (and other) probability in derivations of the least squares method a century later, a generation before Poisson.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hald | first = Anders | title = A history of parametric statistical inference from Bernoulli to Fisher, 1713 to 1935 | publisher = Anders Hald, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, University of Copenhagen | location = K\u00f8benhavn | year = 2004 | isbn = 87-7834-628-2 | pages = 1\u20135}}</ref>  Laplace considered the probabilities of testimonies, tables of mortality, judgments of tribunals, etc. which are unlikely candidates for classical probability.  In this view, Poisson's contribution was his sharp criticism of the alternative \"inverse\" (subjective, Bayesian) probability interpretation.  Any criticism by Gauss and Laplace was muted and implicit.  (Their later derivations did not use inverse probability.)\n\nMajor contributors to \"classical\" statistics in the early 20th century included [[Ronald Aylmer Fisher|Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson|Pearson]].  Fisher contributed to most of statistics and made significance testing the core of experimental science; Neyman formulated confidence intervals and contributed heavily to sampling theory; Neyman and Pearson paired in the creation of hypothesis testing.  All valued objectivity, so the best interpretation of probability available to them was frequentist.  All were suspicious of \"inverse probability\" (the available alternative) with prior probabilities chosen by the using the principle of indifference.  Fisher said, \"...the theory of inverse probability is founded upon an error, [referring to Bayes theorem] and must be wholly rejected.\" (from his Statistical Methods for Research Workers).  While Neyman was a pure frequentist,<ref name=Neyman/> Fisher's views of probability were unique; Both had nuanced view of probability.  [[Richard von Mises|von Mises]] offered a combination of mathematical and philosophical support for frequentism in the era.<ref name=Mises/><ref name=\"Gilles\">''The Frequency theory''  Chapter 5; discussed in Donald Gilles, ''Philosophical theories of probability'' (2000), Psychology Press. {{ISBN|9780415182751}} , p. 88.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term 'frequentist' was first used by [[Maurice Kendall|M. G. Kendall]] in 1949, to contrast with [[Bayesian probability|Bayesians]], whom he called \"non-frequentists\".<ref>[http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/verduin/stathist/1stword.htm Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Probability & Statistics]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kendall|first=Maurice George|author-link=Maurice Kendall|title=On the Reconciliation of Theories of Probability|journal=Biometrika|year=1949|volume=36|pages=101\u2013116|issue=1/2|publisher=Biometrika Trust|jstor=2332534 |doi=10.1093/biomet/36.1-2.101}}</ref> He observed\n:3....we may broadly distinguish two main attitudes. One takes probability as 'a degree of rational belief', or some similar idea...the second defines probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence of events, or by relative proportions in 'populations' or 'collectives'; (p. 101)\n:...\n:12. It might be thought that the differences between the frequentists and the non-frequentists (if I may call them such) are largely due to the differences of the domains which they purport to cover. (p. 104)\n:...\n:''I assert that this is not so'' ... The essential distinction between the frequentists and the non-frequentists is, I think, that the former, in an effort to avoid anything savouring of matters of opinion, seek to define probability in terms of the objective properties of a population, real or hypothetical, whereas the latter do not. [emphasis in original]\n\n\"The Frequency Theory of Probability\" was used a generation earlier as a chapter title in Keynes (1921).<ref name=\"keynesVIII\" />\n\nThe historical sequence: probability concepts were introduced and much of probability mathematics derived (prior to the 20th century), classical statistical inference methods were developed, the mathematical foundations of probability were solidified and current terminology was introduced (all in the 20th century). The primary historical sources in probability and statistics did not use the current terminology of classical, subjective (Bayesian) and frequentist probability.\n\n==Alternative views==\n{{Main|Probability interpretations}}\n[[Probability theory]] is a branch of mathematics. While its roots reach centuries into the past, it reached maturity with the axioms of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in 1933. The theory focuses on the valid operations on probability values rather than on the initial assignment of values; the mathematics is largely independent of any interpretation of probability.\n\nApplications and interpretations of [[probability]] are considered by philosophy, the sciences and statistics. All are interested in the extraction of knowledge from observations\u2014[[inductive reasoning]]. There are a variety of competing interpretations;<ref name=SEPIP>{{citation |last=H\u00e1jek |first=Alan |title=Interpretations of Probability |series=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor1-first=Edward N. |editor1-last=Zalta|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/probability-interpret/ |archivedate=Winter 2012}}</ref> All have problems.  Major interpretations include classical probability, subjective probability and frequency interpretations.\n\n* [[Classical definition of probability|Classical probability]] assigns probabilities based on physical idealized symmetry (dice, coins, cards). The classical definition is at risk of circularity; Probabilities are defined by assuming equality of probabilities.<ref name=Ash>{{cite book |last=Ash |first=Robert B. |title=Basic Probability Theory |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1970 |pages=1\u20132}}</ref> In the absence of symmetry the utility of the definition is limited.\n* [[Bayesian probability|Subjective (Bayesian) probability]] (a family of competing interpretations) considers degrees of belief. All practical \"subjective\" probability interpretations are so constrained to rationality as to avoid most subjectivity. Real subjectivity is repellent to the sciences which strive for results independent of the observer and analyst. The historical roots of this concept extended to such non-numeric applications as legal evidence.\n* Frequency interpretations are empirical\u2014they are defined by a ratio from an infinite series of trials. This is a very natural interpretation for scientific experiments. Mathematicians are dubious of the convergence properties of the non-mathematical series.<ref name=Ash />\n\nThe frequentist interpretation does resolve difficulties with the classical interpretation, such as any problem where the natural symmetry of outcomes is not known. It does not address other issues, such as the [[dutch book]]. [[Propensity probability]] is an alternative physicalist approach.<ref name=SEPIP />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Venn>Venn, John (1888) ''The Logic of Chance'', 3rd Edition [https://archive.org/details/logicofchance029416mbp archive.org].

Firstly, to reflect the hope and belief that he would live to celebrate his 100th birthday in 2030; secondly, and more importantly, to break free of the widespread practice of [[naming conventions]] that he saw as rooted in a [[collectivist]] mentality, and existing only as a relic of humankind's tribalistic past. He viewed traditional names as almost always stamping a label of [[collective identity]]\u2014varying from [[gender]] to nationality\u2014on the individual, thereby existing as prima facie elements of thought processes in the human cultural fabric, that tended to degenerate into stereotyping, factionalism, and discrimination. In his own words, \"Conventional names define a person's past: ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, religion. I am not who I was ten years ago and certainly not who I will be in twenty years. [...] The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time.

The best known traits are the replacement of Standard Dutch (pre-)velar fricatives ''g'' and ''ch'' in Dutch ({{IPA|/x, \u0263/}}) with glottal  ''h'' {{IPA|[h, \u0266]}} and the overall lack of [[diphthong]]s. The following differences are listed by their Dutch spelling, as some different letters have merged their sounds in Standard Dutch but remained separate sounds in West Flemish. Pronunciations can also differ slightly from region to region.\n\n* ''sch'' - {{IPA|/sx/}} is realised as {{IPA|[sh]}} or {{IPA|[sk\u02b0]}} (''sh'' or ''sk'').\n* ''ei'' - {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[j\u025b]}} (''\u00e8'' or ''j\u00e8'').\n* ''ij '' - {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} is realised as {{IPA|[i]}} (short ''ie'', also written as ''y'').\n* ''au'' - {{IPA|/\u028cu/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u0254w]}} (''ow'')\n* ''ou'' - {{IPA|/\u028cu/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u028a]}} (short ''oe''), it is very similar to the long \"oe\" that is also used in Standard Dutch ({{IPA|[u]}}), which can cause confusion\n* ''e'' - {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[a]}}.\n* ''i'' - {{IPA|/\u026a/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u025b]}}.\n* ''ie'' - {{IPA|/i/}} is longer {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}\n* ''aa'' - {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u00f5]}}.\n\nThe nonexistentce of {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/\u0263/}} in West Flemish makes pronuncing them very difficult for native speakers. That often causes [[hypercorrection]] of the {{IPA|/h/}} sounds to a {{IPA|/x/}} or {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n\nStandard Dutch also has many words with an ''-en'' ({{IPA|/\u0259n/}}) suffix (mostly plural forms of verbs and nouns). While Standard Dutch and most dialects do not pronounce the final ''n'', West Flemish typically drops the ''e'' and pronounces the ''n'' inside the base word. For base words already ending with ''n'', the final ''n'' sound is often lengthened to clarify the suffix. That makes many words become similar to those of [[English language|English]]: ''beaten'', ''listen'' etc.\n\nThe short ''o''  ({{IPA|[\u0254]}}) can also be pronounced as a short ''u'' ({{IPA|[\u028c]}}). That happens spontaneously to some words, but other words keep their original short ''o'' sounds. Similarly, the short ''a'' ({{IPA|[\u0251]}}) can turn into a short ''o'' ({{IPA|[\u0254]}}) in some words spontaneously.\n\nThe diphthong ''ui'' ({{IPA|/\u0153y/}}) does not exist in West Flemish and is replaced by a long ''u'' ({{IPA|[\u0289]}}) or a long ''ie'' ({{IPA|[i:]}}). Like for the ''ui'', the long ''o'' ({{IPA|[o]}}) can be replaced by an {{IPA|[\u00f8]}} (''eu'') for some words but a {{IPA|[wo]}} for others. That often causes similarities to ranchers English.\n\nHere are some examples showing the sound shifts that are part of the vocabulary:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English\n|-\n| vol (short ''o'') || vul {{IPA|[v\u028cl]}}|| full\n|-\n| zon (short ''o'') || zunne {{IPA|[z\u028c:n\u0259]}}|| sun\n|-\n| kom (short ''o'') || kom {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}}|| come\n|-\n| boter (long ''o'') || beuter {{IPA|[b\u00f8t\u0259r]}}|| butter\n|-\n| boot (long ''o'') || boot {{IPA|[bwot]}} || boat\n|-\n| kuiken || kiek'n {{IPA|[ki:kn]}} || chicken\n|-\n| bruin || brun {{IPA|[bryn]}} || brown\n|}\n\n== Grammar ==\n=== Plural form ===\nPlural forms in Standard Dutch most often add ''-en'', but West Flemish usually uses ''-s'', like the Lower Saxon Germanic dialects and even more prominently in English in which ''-en'' has become very rare. Under the influence of Standard Dutch, ''-s'' is being used by fewer people, and younger speakers tend to use ''-en''.\n\n=== Verb conjugation ===\nThe verbs ''zijn'' (\"to be\") and ''hebben'' (\"to have\") are also conjugated differently.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English !! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English\n|-\n| zijn || zyn || to be || hebben || \u00e8n || to have\n|-\n| ik ben || 'k zyn || I am || ik heb || 'k \u00e8 || I have\n|-\n| gij zijt || gy zyt || you are || jij hebt || gy \u00e8t || you have\n|-\n| hij is || ie is || he is || hij heeft || ie \u00e8t || he has\n|-\n| wij zijn || wydder zyn || we are || wij hebben || wydder \u00e8n || we have\n|-\n| jullie zijn || gydder zyt || you are || jullie hebben || gydder \u00e8t || you have\n|-\n| zij zijn || zydder zyn || they are || zij hebben || zydder \u00e8n || they have\n|}\n\n=== Double subject ===\nWest Flemish often has a double subject.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English\n|-\n| Jij hebt dat gedaan. || '''G'''' \u00e8 '''gy''' da gedoan. || You have done that.\n|-\n| Ik heb dat niet gedaan. || ''''K''' \u00e8n '''ekik''' da nie gedoan.  || I didn't do that.\n|}\n\n=== Articles ===\nStandards Dutch has an indefinite article that does not depend on gender, unlike in West Flemish. However, a gender-independent article is increasingly used. Like in English, ''n'' is pronounced only if the next word begins with a vowel sound.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English\n|-\n| een stier (m) || ne stier || a bull\n|-\n| een koe (f) || e koe  || a cow\n|-\n| een kalf (o) || e kolf || a calf\n|-\n| een aap (m) || nen oap || an ape\n|-\n| een huis (o) || en 'us || a house\n|}\n\n=== Conjugation of ''yes'' and ''no'' ===\nAnother feature of West Flemish is the conjugation of ''ja'' and ''nee'' (\"yes\" and \"no\") to the subject of the sentence. That is somewhat related to the double subject, but even when the rest of the sentence is not pronounced, ''ja'' and ''nee'' are generally used with the first part of the double subject. There is also an extra word, ''toet'' ({{IPA|[tut]}}), negates the previous sentence but gives a positive answer.\n\n''Ja'', ''nee'' and ''toet'' can also all be strengthened by adding ''mo-'' or ''ba-''. Both mean \"but\" and are derived from Dutch ''but'' or ''maar'') and can be even used together (''mobatoet'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English\n|-\n| Heb jij dat gedaan? - Ja / Nee || \u00c8j gy da gedoan? - Joak / Nink|| Did you do that? - Yes / No\n|-\n| Je hebt dat niet gedaan, h\u00e9? - Maar jawel || G'\u00e8t da nie gedoan, \u00e9? - Batoet || You didn't do that, eh? - But yes I did.\n|-\n| Heeft hij dat gedaan? - Ja / Nee || \u00c8t ie da gedoan? - Joaj / Nij || Did he do that? - Yes / No\n|-\n| Gaan we verder? - Ja / Nee || Zyn we? - Jow / Niw || Can we go? - Yes / No\n|}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nWest Flemish inherited many words from Saxon settlers and later on had English loanwords from the wool and cloth trades. Both categories differ from Standard Dutch and show similarities with English and so is difficult to separate both categories.\n\nDuring the [[Industrial Revolution]], the increasing trade with France caused many industrial loanwords from French.\n\n=== False friends ===\nEven when words exist in both Dutch and West Flemish, their meaning can be different. That sometimes causes confusion for native speakers who do not realise that words are used differently.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English\n|-\n| achter || bachtn || after / behind (a notion of space)\n|-\n| na || achter || past / after (a notion of time)\n|-\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n[[File:Yzeren Rampe.jpg|thumb|Apartment building in [[Blankenberge]] (Belgium) with West Flemish name \"Yzeren Rampe\" (Iron embankment)]]\n* [[Dutch dialects]]\n* [[Flemish people]] (''Flemings'' or ''Vlamingen'')\n* [[French Flemish]]\n* [[Hebban olla vogala]]\n* [[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Debrabandere\n|first=Frans\n|chapter=Kortrijk\n|editor-last1=Kruijsen\n|editor-first1=Joep\n|editor-last2=van der Sijs\n|editor-first2=Nicoline\n|title=Honderd Jaar Stadstaal\n|publisher=Uitgeverij Contact\n|date=1999\n|pages=289\u2013299\n|url=http://dbnl.org/arch/sijs002hond01_01/pag/sijs002hond01_01.pdf\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|West Flemish language}}\n* [http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/neerlandes/an/i1/i1.html Euromosaic report on West Flemish (thus Dutch) in France]\n   \n{{InterWiki|code=vls}}\n{{Languages of Belgium}}\n{{Languages of the Benelux}}\n{{Germanic languages}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dutch dialects]]\n[[Category:Languages of France]]\n[[Category:Languages of Belgium]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Flanders]]\n[[Category:Culture of Zeeland]]\n[[Category:Sluis]]\n[[Category:Zeelandic Flanders]]", "sha1": "2yjqcs4qm19dzbajbmzmbx269r55f4m"}}, {"title": "Fritz Leiber", "ns": "0", "id": "10875", "revision": {"id": "864563039", "parentid": "864113747", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T01:32:42Z", "contributor": {"ip": "31.49.246.230"}, "comment": "/* Writing career */ Expanded Mythos section", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the speculative fiction writer|his father|Fritz Leiber (actor)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name        = Fritz Leiber\n| image       = FSF 0769.jpg\n| caption     = Leiber portrait by [[Ed Emshwiller]] (July 1969)\n| birth_name   = Fritz Reuter Leiber Jr.\n| birth_date   = {{birth date|1910|12|24|mf=y}}\n| birth_place  = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n| death_date   = {{death date and age|1992|09|5|1910|12|24|mf=y}}\n| death_place  = [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States\n| occupation  = Writer\n| nationality = American\n| period      = 1934\u20131992{{efn|name=1934/35}}\n| genre       = [[fantasy fiction|Fantasy]], [[horror fiction|horror]], [[science fiction]]\n| notableworks= [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]], [[The Big Time]]\n| spouse      = {{marriage|Jonquil Stephens|1936|1969|reason=died}}<br>{{marriage|Margo Skinner|1992}}\n| children    = [[Justin Leiber]]\n| relatives   = [[Fritz Leiber (actor)|Fritz Leiber]] (father)<br>Virginia Bronson Leiber (mother)\n| awards      = <!-- Infobox writer no longer supports the fields influences and influenced.

From 1937 to 1941, he was employed by Consolidated Book Publishing as a staff writer for the ''Standard American Encyclopedia''. In 1941, the family moved to California, where Leiber served as a speech and drama instructor at [[Occidental College]] during the 1941\u20131942 academic year.\n\nUnable to conceal his disdain for academic politics as the United States entered [[World War II]], he decided that the struggle against [[fascism]] was more important than his long-held [[pacifist]] convictions. He accepted a position with [[Douglas Aircraft]] in quality inspection, primarily working on the [[C-47 Skytrain]]; throughout the war, he continued to regularly publish fiction in a variety of periodicals.<ref name=anderson/>\n\nThereafter, the family returned to Chicago, where Leiber served as associate editor of ''[[Science Digest]]'' from 1945 to 1956. During this decade (forestalled by a fallow interregnum from 1954 to 1956), his output (including the 1947 [[Arkham House]] anthology ''[[Night's Black Agents]]'') was characterized by [[Poul Anderson]] as \"a lot of the best science fiction and fantasy in the business.\" In 1958, the Leibers returned to Los Angeles. By this juncture, he was able to relinquish his journalistic career and support his family as a full-time fiction writer.<ref name=anderson/>\n\nJonquil's death in 1969 precipitated Leiber's permanent relocation to [[San Francisco]] and exacerbated his longstanding [[alcoholism]] after twelve years of fellowship in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]; however, he would gradually regain relative sobriety (an effort impeded by comorbid [[barbiturate]] abuse) over the next two decades.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Snakes & Spiders: The Definitive Change War Collection|author1=Leiber, F.|author2=Straight, K.|date=2012|publisher=Creative Minority Productions|isbn=9781944327033|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsToCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR6|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref> In 1977, he returned to his original form with a fantasy novel set in modern-day San Francisco, ''[[Our Lady of Darkness]]'', which is about a writer of weird tales who must deal with the death of his wife and his recovery from alcoholism.\n\nPerhaps as a result of his substance abuse, Leiber seems to have suffered periods of penury in the 1970s; [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote of his anger at finding that the much-awarded Leiber had to write his novels on a manual typewriter that was propped up over the sink in his apartment, and [[Marc Laidlaw]] wrote that, when visiting Leiber as a fan in 1976, he \"was shocked to find him occupying one small room of a seedy San Francisco residence hotel, its squalor relieved mainly by walls of books\".<ref>Laidlaw, Marc, \"On ''Our Lady of Darkness'',\" in the anthology ''Horror: Another 100 Best Books'', edited by Stephen Jones and Kim Newman, Carroll & Graf, 2005.</ref> Other reports suggest that Leiber preferred to live simply in the city, spending his money on dining, movies and travel.

[[Judith Merril]] (in the July 1969 issue of ''The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction'') remarks on Leiber's acting skills when the writer won a science fiction convention costume ball. Leiber's costume consisted of a cardboard military collar over turned-up jacket lapels, cardboard insignia, an armband, and a spider pencilled large in black on his forehead, thus turning him into an officer of the Spiders, one of the combatants in his Change War stories. \"The only other component,\" Merril writes, \"was the Leiber instinct for theatre.\"\n\n==Films==\n\nDue to the similarity of the names of the father and the son, some filmographies incorrectly attribute to Fritz Jr. roles which were in fact played by his father, Fritz Leiber Sr., who was the evil Inquisitor in the Errol Flynn adventure film ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940) and had played in many other movies from 1917 onwards until the late 1950s. It is the elder Leiber, not the younger, who appears in the Vincent Price vehicle ''[[The Web (film)|The Web]]'' (1947) and in Charlie Chaplin's ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947).\n\nIn the cult horror film ''[[Equinox (film)|Equinox]]'' (1970) directed by [[Dennis Muren]] and Jack Woods, Leiber has a cameo appearance as  Dr. Watermann, a geologist. In the edited second version of the movie Leiber has no spoken dialogue in the film but features in a few scenes. The original version of the movie has a longer appearance by Leiber recounting the ancient book and a brief speaking role, all of which was cut from the re-release of the film.\n\nHe also appears in the 1979 Schick Sunn Classics documentary ''The Bermuda Triangle'', based on the book by [[Charles Berlitz]], as Chavez.\n\n== Writing career ==\n[[File:Galaxy 195803.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's Hugo Award-winning novel ''The Big Time'' was serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1958]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195911.jpg|thumb|right|The November 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' was devoted exclusively to Leiber's fiction, publishing five original sf and fantasy stories]]\n[[File:If 195902.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's \"Pipe Dream\" was the cover story for the February 1959 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'', illustrated by [[Kelly Freas]]]]\n[[File:Amazing science fiction stories 196001.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's novella \"The Night of the Long Knives\" took the cover of the January 1960 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]\n[[File:Fantastic 196011.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's novelette \"Deadly Moon\" was cover-featured on the November 1960 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'']]\n[[File:Galaxy 196110.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's \"The Beat Cluster\" took the cover of the October 1961 ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'']]\n[[File:Fantastic 196111.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's \"Hatchery of Dreams\"  was the cover story on the November 1961 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'']]\n[[File:Fantastic 196202.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's novelette \"A Bit of the Dark World\"  took the cover of the February 1962 issue of ''Fantastic'']]\n[[File:If 196209.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's \"The Snowbank Orbit\" was the cover story for the September 1962 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'']]\n[[File:Fantastic 196210.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's only solo Grey Mouser tale, \"The Unholy Grail\", was the cover story for the October 1962 issue of ''Fantastic'']]\n[[File:Fantastic 196302.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's \"Dr. Adams' Garden of Evil\"  took the cover of the February 1963 issue of ''Fantastic'']]\n[[File:Fantastic 196308.jpg|thumb|right|Leiber's novelette \"Bazaar of the Bizarre\" was the cover story for the August 1963 issue of ''Fantastic'']]\n\nLeiber was heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft and [[Robert Graves]] in the first two decades of his career. Beginning in the late 1950s, he was increasingly influenced by the works of [[Carl Jung]], particularly by the concepts of the [[anima (Jung)|anima]] and the [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]]. From the mid-1960s onwards, he began incorporating elements of Joseph Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. These concepts are often openly mentioned in his stories, especially the anima, which becomes a method of exploring his fascination with, but estrangement from, the female.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nLeiber liked cats, which feature prominently in many of his stories. Tigerishka, for example, is a [[cat-like aliens|cat-like alien]] who is sexually attractive to the human protagonist yet repelled by human customs in the novel ''The Wanderer''. Leiber's \"Gummitch\" stories feature a kitten with an I.Q. of 160, just waiting for his ritual cup of coffee so that he can become human, too.\n\nHis first stories in the 1930s and 40s were inspired by Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. The leading critic and historian of the wider Mythos, S. T. Joshi, has singled out Leiber's \"The Sunken Land\" (''Unknown Worlds'', February 1942) as perhaps the most accomplished of the early stories based on Lovecraft's Mythos.<ref>S. T. Joshi, \"Cthulhu's Empire: H. P. Lovecraft's Influence on His Contemporaries and Successors\", ''Critical Insights: Pulp Fiction of the 1920s and 1930s'', Salem Press, 2013.</ref> Leiber also later wrote several essays on Lovecraft the man, such as \"A Literary Copernicus\", the publication of which formed a key moment in the emergence of a serious critical appreciation of Lovecraft's life and work.\n\nLeiber's first professional sale was \"Two Sought Adventure\" (''Unknown'', August 1939),<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Doubleday | isbn = 0-425-06176-0 | last = Ellison | first = Harlan | title = Dangerous Visions - Introduction to: Gonna Roll the Bones  | location = New York | year = 1967 }}</ref> which introduced his most famous characters, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. In 1943, his first two novels were serialized in ''Unknown'' (the supernatural horror-oriented ''[[Conjure Wife]]'', partially inspired by his deleterious experiences on the faculty of Occidental College) and ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (''Gather, Darkness'').\n\n1947 marked the publication of his first book, ''[[Night's Black Agents]]'', a short story collection containing seven stories grouped as 'Modern Horrors', one as a 'Transition', and two grouped as 'Ancient Adventures': \"The Sunken Land\" and \"Adept's Gambit\", which are both stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\n\nBook publication of the science fiction novel ''Gather, Darkness'' followed in 1950. It deals with a futuristic world that follows the Second Atomic Age which is ruled by scientists, until in the throes of a new Dark Age, the witches revolt.\n\nIn 1951, Leiber was Guest of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention in New Orleans. Further novels followed during the 1950s, and in 1958 ''[[The Big Time]]'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]].<ref name=SFAwards/>\n\nLeiber published further books in the 1960s. His novel ''[[The Wanderer (Fritz Leiber novel)|The Wanderer]]'' (1964) also received the Hugo for Best Novel.<ref name=SFAwards/> In the novel, an artificial planet, quickly nicknamed the Wanderer, materializes from hyperspace within earth's orbit. The Wanderer's gravitational field captures the moon and shatters it into something like one of Saturn's rings. On Earth, the Wanderer's gravity well triggers massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and tidal phenomena. The multi-threaded plot follows the exploits of a large ensemble cast as they struggle to survive the global disaster.\n\nLeiber received the [[Hugo Award for Best Novella]] in 1970 and 1971 for \"Ship of Shadows\" (1969) and \"[[Ill Met in Lankhmar]]\" (1970). \"[[Gonna Roll the Bones]]\" (1967), his contribution to Harlan Ellison's ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' anthology, received the [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette]] and the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette]] in 1968.<ref name=SFAwards/>\n\n''Our Lady of Darkness'' (1977)\u2014originally serialized in short form in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' under the title \"The Pale Brown Thing\" (1977)\u2014featured cities as the breeding grounds for new types of [[elemental]]s called paramentals, summonable by the dark art of [[megapolisomancy]], with such activities centering on the [[Transamerica Pyramid]]. Its main characters include Franz Westen, Jaime Donaldus Byers, and the magician Thibault de Castries. ''Our Lady of Darkness'' won the [[World Fantasy Award\u2014Novel]].<ref name=SFAwards/>\n\nLeiber also did the 1966 novelization of the [[Clair Huffaker]] screenplay of ''[[Tarzan and the Valley of Gold (film)|Tarzan and the Valley of Gold]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill and Sue-On Hillman |url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag2/0210.html |title=ERBzine 0210: Tarzan and the Valley of Gold ~ ERB C.H.A.S.E.R |publisher=Erbzine.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany of Leiber's most-acclaimed works are short stories, especially in the horror genre. Owing to such stories as \"The Smoke Ghost\", \"The Girl With the Hungry Eyes\" and \"You're All Alone\" (later expanded as ''The Sinful Ones''), he is widely regarded as one of the forerunners of the modern urban horror story. Leiber also challenged the conventions of science fiction through reflexive narratives such as \"A Bad Day For Sales\" (first published in ''Galaxy Science Fiction'', July 1953), in which the protagonist, Robie, \"America\u2019s only genuine mobile salesrobot,\"<ref>Leiber, Fritz. \"A Bad Day For Sales\".

Both stories reflect Leiber's uneasy fascination with [[Nazism]], an uneasiness compounded by his mixed feelings about his German ancestry and his philosophical pacifism during World War II.\n\nLeiber was named the second [[Gandalf Award|Gandalf Grand Master]] of Fantasy by participants in the 1975 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] (Worldcon), after the posthumous inaugural award to [[J.

Leiber himself is credited with inventing the term [[sword and sorcery]] for the particular subgenre of epic fantasy exemplified by his Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories.{{citation needed |date=April 2013}}\n\nIn an appreciation in the July 1969 \"Special Fritz Leiber Issue\" of ''The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction'', [[Judith Merril]] writes of Leiber's connection with his readers: \"That this kind of ''personal'' response...is shared by thousands of other readers, has been made clear on several occasions.\" The November 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'', for instance: Leiber had just come out of one of his recurrent dry spells, and editor [[Cele Goldsmith Lalli|Cele Lalli]] bought up all his new material until there was enough [five stories] to fill an issue; the magazine came out with a big black headline across its cover \u2014 ''Leiber Is Back!''\n\n== Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser ==\n{{Main|Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser}}\n\nHis legacy appears to have been consolidated by the most famous of his creations, the ''Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser'' stories, written over a span of 50 years.<ref name=isfdb-fafhrd/> The first of them, \"Two Sought Adventure\", appeared in ''[[Unknown magazine|Unknown]]'', August 1939. They are concerned with an unlikely pair of heroes found in and around the city of [[Lankhmar]]. Fafhrd was based on Leiber himself and the Mouser on his friend [[Harry Otto Fischer]], and the two characters were created in a series of letters exchanged by the two in the mid-1930s. These stories were among the progenitors of many of the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] of the [[sword and sorcery]] genre. They are also notable among sword and sorcery stories in that, over the course of the stories, his two heroes mature, take on more responsibilities, and eventually settle down into marriage.\n\nSome Fafhrd and Mouser stories were recognized by annual genre awards: \"Scylla's Daughter\" (1961) was \"Short Story\" Hugo finalist and \"Ill Met in Lankhmar\" (1970) won the \"Best Novella\" Hugo and Nebula Awards.<ref name=SFAwards/> Leiber's last major work, ''The Knight and Knave of Swords'' (1991), brought the series to a close while leaving room for possible sequels. In the last year of his life, Leiber was considering allowing the series to be continued by other writers, but his sudden death made this more difficult. One new Fafhrd and the Mouser novel, ''[[Swords Against the Shadowland]]'', by [[Robin Wayne Bailey]], did appear in 1998.\n\nThe stories were influential in shaping the genre and were influential on other works. [[Joanna Russ]]' stories about thief-assassin Alyx (collected in 1976 in ''[[The Adventures of Alyx]]'') were in part inspired by Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Alyx in fact made guest appearances in two of Leiber's stories. Numerous writers have paid homage to the stories. For instance, [[Terry Pratchett]]'s city of [[Ankh-Morpork]] bears something more than a passing resemblance to Lankhmar (acknowledged by Pratchett by the placing of the swordsman-thief \"The Weasel\" and his giant barbarian comrade \"Bravd\" in the opening scenes of the first [[Discworld]] novel). More recently, playing off the visit of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser to our world in ''Adept's Gambit'' (set in second century B.C. Tyre), [[Steven Saylor]]'s short story \"Ill Seen in Tyre\" takes his [[Roma Sub Rosa]] series hero Gordianus to the city of Tyre a hundred years later, where the two visitors from Nehwon are remembered as local legends.<ref>Saylor, Steven, \"Ill Seen in Tyre\", in the anthology ''Rogues'', edited by Gardner Dozois and George R.R.

However, there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history, and sometimes involving neighbouring countries. The [[demonym]] associated with Flanders is [[Flemings|Fleming]], while the corresponding adjective is [[Flemish]]. The official capital of Flanders is [[City of Brussels|Brussels]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vlaanderen.be/en/discover-flanders |title=Discover Flanders |website=Flanders.be}}</ref> although the [[Brussels Capital Region]] has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees the community aspects of Flanders life in Brussels such as (Flemish) culture and education.\n\nFlanders, despite not being the biggest part of [[Belgium]] by area, is the area with the largest population (68.5%). 7,876,873 out of 11,491,346 Belgian inhabitants live in Flanders or the bilingual city of [[Brussels]]. Not including Brussels, there are five modern Flemish provinces.\n\nIn medieval contexts, the original \"[[County of Flanders]]\" stretched around AD 900 from the [[Strait of Dover]] to the [[Scheldt]] [[estuary]] and expanded from there. This county also still corresponds roughly with the modern-day Belgian provinces of [[West Flanders]] and [[East Flanders]], along with neighbouring parts of [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Although this original meaning is still relevant, during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace to use the term \"Flanders\" to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, stretching all the way to the [[River Meuse]], as well as cultural movements such as [[Flemish art]]. In accordance with late 20th century [[state reform in Belgium|Belgian state reforms]] the Belgian part of this area was made into two political entities: the \"[[Flemish Community]]\" ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschap}}) and the \"[[Flemish Region]]\" ({{lang-nl|Vlaams Gewest}}). These entities were merged, although geographically the Flemish Community, which has a broader cultural mandate, covers Brussels, whereas the Flemish Region does not.\n\nFlanders, by every definition, has figured prominently in European history since the [[Middle Ages]]. In this period, cities such as [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]], and later [[Antwerp]] made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, trading, and weaving the [[wool]] of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century [[industrial revolution]] but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking [[Wallonia]]. In the second half of the 20th century, however, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders and Brussels are significantly more wealthy than Wallonia and in general one of the wealthiest regions in Europe and the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2874.htm|title=Belgium|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nGeographically, Flanders is mainly flat, and has a small section of coast on the North Sea. Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated, with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer (1,200 per square mile). It touches France to the west near the coast, and borders the Netherlands to the north and east, and Wallonia to the south. The [[Brussels Capital Region]] is an officially bilingual [[enclave]] within the Flemish Region. Flanders has exclaves of its own: [[Voeren]] in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and [[Baarle-Hertog]] in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n=== In Belgium ===\nThe term \"Flanders\" has several main modern meanings:\n* The \"Flemish community\" or \"Flemish nation\", i.e. the social, cultural and linguistic, scientific and educational, economical and political community of the [[Flemings]]. It comprises 6.5 million Belgians (60%) who consider Dutch to be their mother tongue.\n* The political subdivisions of Belgium: the [[Flemish Region]] (competent in mainly economic matters) and the [[Flemish Community]] (competent in mainly cultural matters). The first does not comprise Brussels (which forms a [[Brussels-Capital Region|Region on itself]]), whereas the latter does comprise the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of Brussels.\n* The political institutions that govern both subdivisions: the operative body \"[[Flemish Government]]\" and the legislative organ \"[[Flemish Parliament]]\".\n* The two westernmost provinces of the Flemish Region, [[West Flanders]] and [[East Flanders]], forming the central portion of the historic [[County of Flanders]].\n\n=== In Belgium and neighbouring countries ===\n* An ''[[ancien regime]]'' territory that existed from the 8th century (''Flandria'') until its absorption by the [[French First Republic]]. Until the 1600s, this county also extended over parts of what are now France and the Netherlands. {{main|County of Flanders}}\n* One of the historically Flemish regions which are now part of France, in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord department]]. This is referred to as [[French Flanders]], and can be divided into two smaller regions: [[Walloon Flanders]] and [[Westhoek (region)|Maritime Flanders (Westhoek)]]. The first region was predominantly French-speaking already in the 1600s, the latter became so in the 20th century. The [[Lille|city of Lille]] identifies itself as \"Flemish\", and this is reflected, for instance, in the name of its local railway station [[TGV]] ''[[Gare de Lille Flandres|Lille Flandres]]''. {{main|French Flanders}}\n* The historically Flemish region which became part of the [[Dutch Republic]], now part of the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]]. {{main|Zeelandic Flanders}}\n\n=== Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ===\nThe significance of the County of Flanders and its [[Count of Flanders|counts]] eroded through time, but the designation remained in a very broad sense. In the [[Early modern period]], the term Flanders was associated with the southern part of the [[Low Countries]]: the [[Southern Netherlands]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, it became increasingly commonplace to refer to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium as \"Flanders\". The linguistic limit between French and Dutch was recorded in the early '60's, from [[Kortrijk]] to [[Maastricht]]. Now, Flanders extends over the northern part of Belgium, including [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] (corresponding closely to the medieval [[County of Loon]]), and the Dutch-speaking Belgian parts of the medieval [[Duchy of Brabant]].\n\nThe ambiguity between this wider area and that of the County (or the Belgian parts thereof), still remains. In most present-day contexts however, in general the term Flanders is taken to refer to either the political, social, cultural, and linguistic community (and the corresponding official institution, the [[Flemish Community]]), or the geographical area, one of the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the [[Flemish Region]].\n\nIn the [[history of art]] and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and [[Netherlandish]] are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"[[Early Netherlandish painting]]\", and it is not uncommon to see [[Mosan art]] categorized as Flemish art. In music the ''[[Franco-Flemish School]]'' is also known as the ''Dutch School''.\n\nWithin this Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, French has never ceased to be spoken by some citizens and Jewish groups have been speaking [[Yiddish]] in Antwerp for centuries. Today, Flanders' minority residents include 170 nationalities{{efn |name=\"Note_Nationality-Minority-Education\" |The relation between nationality, genetic ethnicity, native and mainly spoken language(s) (within a group of same ethnicity and age, in presence of elders, in ethnically mixed groups), and minority group identification, can be complex: Dutch nationals constituting one of the largest groups of foreigners, share the [[Dutch language|standard language]] with Flemish locals but their accent is enough to immediately distinguish them. The majority of immigrants from certain other countries, had belonged to a minority or disadvantaged group there. Children born in Belgium from residents of foreign nationality, very often acquired Belgian citizenship. Regardless of nationality, according to Belgian Law, obligatory education in schools located in the Flemish Region are in Dutch language. In Brussels, teaching is also done in French. The determination of statistical samples and interpretation of publicized figures can easily lead to false assumptions or conclusions.}} \u2014 the largest groups speaking [[French language|French]], English, [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic]], Spanish, Italian and Polish.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Flanders}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{main|Belgae}}\n\nWhen [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the area he described it as the less economically developed and more warlike part of ''[[Gallia Belgica]]''. His informants told him that especially in the east, the tribes claimed ancestral connections and kinship with the [[Germanic peoples|\"Germanic\" peoples]] then east of the [[Rhine]]. Under the [[Roman empire]] the whole of ''Gallia Belgica'' became an administrative province. The future counties of Flanders and Brabant remained part of this province connected to what is now France, but in the east modern Limburg became part of the Rhine frontier province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' connected to what is now the Netherlands and Germany. ''Gallia Belgica'' and ''Germania Inferior'' were the two most northerly continental provinces of the [[Roman empire]].\n\nIn the future county of Flanders, the main [[Belgic]] tribe in early Roman times was the [[Menapii]], but also on the coast were the [[Marsacii]] and [[Morini]]. In the central part of modern Belgium were the [[Nervii]] and in the east were the [[Tungri]]. The Tungri especially were understood to have links to Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Another notable Germanic group were the [[Toxandrians]] who appear to have lived in the [[Campine|Kempen]] region, in the northern parts of both the Nervian and Tungrian provinces, probably stretching into the modern Netherlands. The Roman provinces of the Menapii, Nervii and Tungri therefore corresponded roughly with the medieval counties of Flanders, Brabant and [[County of Loon|Loon]], and the modern Flemish provinces of East and West Flanders (Menapii), Brabant and Antwerp (Nervii), and Belgian Limburg (Tungri). Brabant appears to have been home to relatively unpopulated forest area, the [[Silva Carbonaria]], forming a natural boundary between northeast and southwest Belgium.\n\nLinguistically, the tribes in this area were under [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] influence in the south, and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] influence in the east, but there is disagreement about what language was spoken locally, which may even have been an intermediate \"[[Nordwestblock]]\" language related to both. By the first century BC [[Germanic languages]] had become prevalent.\n\n=== Historical Flanders ===\n{{main|County of Flanders}}\n\nThe County of Flanders was a [[feudal]] [[fief]] in [[West Francia]]. The first certain Count in the comital family, [[Baldwin I of Flanders]], is first reported in a document of 862 when he eloped with a daughter of his king [[Charles the Bald]]. The region developed as a medieval economic power with a large degree of political autonomy. While its trading cities remained strong, it was weakened and divided when districts fell under direct French royal rule in the late 12th century. The remaining parts of Flanders came under the rule of the counts of neighbouring imperial [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] under [[Baldwin V of Hainaut]] in 1191.\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages]] Flanders' trading towns (notably [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]] and [[Ypres]]) made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the [[wool]] of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Ghent, Bruges, Ypres and the [[Franc of Bruges]] formed the [[Four Members]], a form of parliament that exercised considerable power in Flanders.<ref>''Philip the Good: the apogee of Burgundy'' by Richard Vaughan, p201</ref>\n\nIncreasingly powerful from the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban [[Medieval commune|communes]] were instrumental in defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300\u20131302), finally defeating the French in the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] (11 July 1302), near [[Kortrijk]]. Two years later, the [[Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305)|uprising was defeated]] and Flanders remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, however, owing to widespread European population decline following the [[Black Death]] of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to [[Worstead]] and [[North Walsham]] in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woolen industry.\n\nThe County of Flanders started to take control of the neighbouring [[County of Brabant]] during the life of [[Louis II, Count of Flanders]] (1330-1384), who fought his sister-in-law [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant]] for control of it.\n\nThe entire area, straddling the ancient boundary of France and the Holy Roman Empire, later passed to [[Philip the Bold]] in 1384, the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]], with his capital in [[Brussels]]. The titles were eventually more clearly united under his grandson [[Philip the Good]] (1396 \u2013 1467). This large Duchy passed in [[<!--same year: Great Privilege + Habsburg by her marriage-->Mary of Burgundy|1477]] to the [[Habsburg]] dynasty, and in [[<!--Charles V abdicated-->Philip II of Spain|1556]] to the kings of Spain. Western and southern districts of Flanders were confirmed under French rule under successive treaties of [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|1659]] (Artois), [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|1668]], and [[Treaties of Nijmegen|1678]].\n\nThe County of Loon, approximately the modern Flemish province of Limburg, remained independent under the lordship of the Archbishop of Li\u00e8ge until the French Revolution, but surrounded by the Burgundians, and under their influence.\n\n=== Low Countries ===\n{{main|Low Countries}}\n\n==== Beeldenstorm ====\nIn 1500, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was born in [[Ghent]]. He inherited the [[Seventeen Provinces]] (1506), Spain (1516) with its colonies and in 1519 was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>William Robertson, The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V (NY, 1874), p 116</ref> The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by Charles V, established the Low Countries as the Seventeen Provinces (or [[Spanish Netherlands]] in its broad sense) as an entity separate from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and from France.

Among the wealthy traders of Antwerp, the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] beliefs of the German [[Hanseatic (class)|Hanseatic]] traders found appeal, perhaps partly for economic reasons. The spread of Protestantism in this city was aided by the presence of an [[Augustinian]] cloister (founded 1514) in the St. Andries quarter. Luther, an Augustinian himself, had taught some of the monks, and his works were in print by 1518. The first Lutheran martyrs came from Antwerp. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] resulted in consecutive but overlapping waves of reform: a Lutheran, followed by a militant [[Anabaptist]], then a [[Mennonite]], and finally a [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] movement. These movements existed independently of each other.\n\n[[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] Calvinism in Flanders, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and Holland (what is now approximately [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] was part of the [[Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] and was Catholic ''de facto''). In 1566, the wave of [[iconoclasm]] known as the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' was a prelude to religious war between Catholics and Protestants, especially the Anabaptists. The ''Beeldenstorm'' started in what is now [[French Flanders]], with open-air sermons ({{lang-nl|hagepreken}}) that spread through the Low Countries, first to Antwerp and Ghent, and from there further east and north. In total it lasted not even a month.\n\n==== The Eighty Years' War and its consequences ====\nSubsequently, Philip II sent [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|the Duke]] of [[Duchy of Alba|Alba]] to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the southern part of the Provinces, who signed the [[Union of Arras|Union of Atrecht]], which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the [[Union of Utrecht]] and settled in 1581 the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, but before the revolt could be completely defeated, a war between England and Spain had broken out, forcing Philip's Spanish troops to halt their advance. Meanwhile, the Spanish armies had already conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. On 17 August 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Eighty Years' War for the (from now on) [[Southern Netherlands]]. The [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] (the Northern Netherlands) fought on until 1648 \u2013 the [[Peace of Westphalia]].\n\n[[File:Sebastian Vrancx02.jpg|thumb|Winter scene by [[Sebastian Vrancx]], 1622]]\nWhile Spain was at war with England, the rebels from the north, strengthened by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s Spanish troops. They managed to conquer a considerable part of Brabant (the later [[Noord-Brabant]] of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary ([[Zeelandic Flanders]]), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front line at the end of this war stabilized and became the current border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to close off the river [[Scheldt]], effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes.\n\nFirst the [[fall of Antwerp]] to the Spanish and later also the closing of the [[Scheldt]] were causes of a considerable emigration of Antverpians.{{efn |An ''Antverpian'', derived from ''Antverpia'', the Latin name of [[Antwerp]], is an inhabitant of this city; the term is also the [[adjective]] expressing that its substantive is from or in that city or belongs to it.}} Many of the Calvinist merchants of Antwerp and also of other Flemish cities left Flanders and emigrated to the north. A large number of them settled in [[Amsterdam]], which was at the time a smaller port, of significance only in the [[Baltic trade]]. In the following years Amsterdam was rapidly transformed into one of the world's most important ports. Because of the contribution of the Flemish exiles to this transformation, the exodus is sometimes described as \"''creating a new Antwerp''\".\n\nFlanders and Brabant, due to these events, went into a period of relative decline from the time of the [[Thirty Years War]].<ref name=\"FiifAntwHist\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Antwerp \u2013 History\n|work=Find it in Flanders\n|publisher=Tourism Flanders & Brussels, Flanders House, London, UK\n|url=http://www.visitflanders.co.uk/cont61_Antwerp_history.aspx\n|accessdate=2 January 2007}}</ref> In the Northern Netherlands however, the mass emigration from Flanders and Brabant became an important driving force behind the [[Dutch Golden Age]].\n\n==== Southern Netherlands (1581\u20131795) ====\n[[File:Quad Flandria.jpg|thumb|1609 map of the county of Flanders]]\nAlthough arts remained at a relatively impressive level for another century with [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577\u20131640) and [[Anthony van Dyck]], Flanders experienced a loss of its former economic and intellectual power under Spanish, Austrian, and French rule, with heavy taxation and rigid imperial political control compounding the effects of industrial stagnation and Spanish-Dutch and Franco-Austrian conflict. The Southern Netherlands suffered severely under the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], but under the reign of Empress Maria-Theresia these lands economically flourished again. Influenced by the Enlightenment, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II was the first sovereign who had been in the Southern Netherlands since King Philip II of Spain left them in 1559.\n\n==== French Revolution and Napoleonic France (1795\u20131815) ====\nIn 1794 the [[History of France#Revolution|French Republican Army]] started using Antwerp as the northernmost naval port of France,<ref name=\"FiifAntwHist\" /> which country officially annexed Flanders the following year as the ''[[The 130 d\u00e9partements|d\u00e9partements]]'' of [[Lys (d\u00e9partement)|Lys]], [[Escaut (d\u00e9partement)|Escaut]], [[Deux-N\u00e8thes]], [[Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure]] and [[Dyle (d\u00e9partement)|Dyle]]. Obligatory (French) army service for all men aged 16\u201325 was one of the main reasons for the people's uprising against the French in 1798, known as the ''Boerenkrijg'' (''Peasants' War''), with the heaviest fighting in the [[Campine]] area.\n\n==== United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131830) ====\nAfter the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] at the 1815 [[Battle of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], sovereignty over the [[Austrian Netherlands]] \u2013 Belgium minus the [[East Cantons]] and Luxembourg \u2013 was given by the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) to the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|United Netherlands]] (Dutch: ''Verenigde Nederlanden''), the state that briefly existed under Sovereign Prince William I of Orange Nassau, the latter King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], after the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] was driven out of the Dutch territories. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was born. The Protestant King of the Netherlands, William I rapidly started the industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. The political system that was set up however, slowly but surely failed to forge a true union between the northern and the southern parts of the Kingdom. The southern [[bourgeoisie]] mainly was Roman Catholic, in contrast to the mainly Protestant north; large parts of the southern bourgeoisie also primarily spoke French rather than Dutch.\n\nIn 1815 the Dutch Senate was reinstated (Dutch: ''Eerste Kamer der Staaten Generaal''). The nobility, mainly coming from the south, became more and more estranged from their northern colleagues. Resentment grew both between the Roman Catholics from the south and the Protestants from the north and among the powerful liberal bourgeoisie from the south and their more moderate colleagues from the north. On 25 August 1830 (after the showing of the opera '[[La Muette de Portici]]' of [[Daniel Auber]] in Brussels) the [[Belgian Revolution]] sparked off and became a fact. On 4 October 1830, the [[Provisional Government of Belgium|Provisional Government]] (Dutch: ''Voorlopig Bewind'') proclaimed the independence, which was later confirmed by the [[National Congress of Belgium|National Congress]] that issued a new Liberal Constitution and declared the new state a [[Constitutional Monarchy]], under the House of [[Saxe-Coburg]]. Flanders now became part of the Kingdom of Belgium, which was recognized by the major European Powers on 20 January 1831. The de facto dissidence was finally recognized by the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] on 19 April 1839.\n\n=== Kingdom of Belgium ===\n{{further|History of Belgium}}\nIn 1830, the [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the splitting up of the two countries. Belgium was confirmed as an independent state by the [[Treaty of London, 1839|Treaty of London]] of 1839, but deprived of the eastern half of Limburg (now Dutch Limburg), and the Eastern half of Luxembourg (now the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). Sovereignty over [[Zeelandic Flanders]], south of the [[Westerscheldt]] river delta, was left with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was allowed to levy a toll on all traffic to Antwerp harbour until 1863.<ref name=\"FiifAntwHist\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetware.com/map/belgium-kingdom-of-belgium-map-b-belg.htm |title=Kingdom of Belgium map (politically outdated) |website=Planet Ware |accessdate=15 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Rise of the Flemish Movement ====\n{{main|Flemish Movement}}\n\nThe Belgian Revolution was not well supported in Flanders and even on 4 October 1830, when the Belgian independence was eventually declared, Flemish authorities refused to take orders from the new Belgian government in Brussels. Only after Flanders was subdued with the aid of a large French military force one month later, under the leadership of the [[Louis Gustave le Doulcet, comte de Pont\u00e9coulant|Count de Pont\u00e9coulant]], did Flanders become a true part of Belgium.\n\nThe French-speaking bourgeoisie showed very little respect for the Dutch-speaking part of the population.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} French became the only official language in Belgium and all secondary and higher education in the Dutch language was abolished. <!--Flemish nationalist claim that the Kingdom of Belgium's co-founder, [[Charles Rogier]] wrote in 1832 to the minister of Justice [[Jean-Joseph Raikem]], that \"the first principles of a good administration are based upon the exclusive use of one language, and it is evident that the only language of the Belgians should be French. In order to achieve this result, it is necessary that all civil and military functions are entrusted to Walloons and Luxemburgers; this way, the Flemish, temporarily deprived of the advantages of these offices, will be constrained to learn French, and we will hence destroy bit by bit the Germanic element in Belgium.\" However, this \"letter\" has been proven to be a myth<ref>L. WILLEMS, \"Over twee Antivlaamsche brieven toegeschreven aan Minister Rogier\", Verslagen en mededelingen van de Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Taal- en Letterkunde, 1902, pp. 53-90</ref>\n\nAccording to nationalists senator [[Alexandre Gendebien]], another cofounder, even declared that the Flemish were \"one of the more inferior races on the Earth, just like the negroes\". Again, we must emphasize that this way of seeing things belongs to the nationalist mythology. For in reality, Gendebien didn't make this statement. He asked, as a rhetorical question if the Flemish were inferior, immediately adding: \"of course not\". -->\n\nIn 1834, all people even remotely suspected of being \"Flemish minded\" or calling for the reunification of the Netherlands were prosecuted and their houses looted and burnt. Flanders, until then a very prosperous European region,{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} was not considered worthwhile for investment and scholarship. A study in 1918 demonstrated that in the first 88 years of its existence, 80% of the Belgian GNP was invested in Wallonia. This led to a widespread poverty in Flanders, forcing roughly 300.000 [[Flemish immigration to Wallonia|Flemish to emigrate to Wallonia]] to start working there in the heavy industry.\n\nAll of these events led to a silent uprising in Flanders against the French-speaking domination. But it was not until 1878 that Dutch was allowed to be used for official purposes in Flanders (see [[language legislation in Belgium]]), although French remained the only official language in Belgium.\n\nIn 1873, Dutch became the official language in public secondary schools. In 1898 Dutch and French were declared equal languages in laws and Royal orders. In 1930 the first Flemish university was opened.\n\nThe first official translation of the Belgian constitution in Dutch was not published until 1967.\n[[File:Gesneuvelden Koksijde - Belgi\u00eb.jpg|thumb|[[Koksijde]], a memorial to soldiers killed in [[World War I]]]]\n\n==== World War I and its consequences ====\nFlanders (and Belgium as a whole) saw some of the greatest loss of life on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[First World War]], in particular from the three battles of [[Ypres]].\n\nFlemish feeling of identity and consciousness grew through the events and experiences of war. The occupying German authorities took several Flemish-friendly measures. More importantly, the experiences of many Dutch-speaking soldiers on the front led by French-speaking officers catalysed Flemish emancipation. The French-speaking officers often gave orders in French only, followed by \"et pour les Flamands, la m\u00eame chose!\", meaning \"and for the Flemish, the same thing!\" (which did not help the Flemish conscripts, who were mostly uneducated farmers and workers unable to have understood what had been said in French).<ref\n name=\"mm-chs\">{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/europe/belgiqueetat_histoire.htm\n |title=Histoire de la Belgique et ses cons\u00e9quences linguistiques\n |work=L'am\u00e9nagement linguistique dans le monde\n |language=French\n |author=Leclerc, Jacques (TLFQ member)\n |publisher=Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise au Qu\u00e9bec (TLFQ), D\u00e9partement de Langues, linguistique et traduction, Facult\u00e9 des Lettres, [[Laval University]], Quebec, Canada\n |date=16 June 2011\n |quote=Et pour les Flamands, la m\u00eame chose!\n |accessdate=21 July 2011<!--Belgian National Feastday, a coincidence-->\n }}<br />\u2014 ''Note: This quote in French language ''\"Et pour ...!\"'' has become a coined expression in Belgium, and as such published abroad.

Since these parties were promised more rights for the Flemings by the German government during World War II, many of them collaborated with the Nazi regime. After the war, collaborators (or people who were ''Zwart'', \"Black\" during the war) were prosecuted and punished, among them many Flemish Nationalists whose main political goal had been the emancipation of Flanders. As a result, up until this day Flemish Nationalism is often associated with right-wing and sometimes fascist ideologies.\n\n==== Flemish autonomy ====\n{{main|State reform in Belgium|2007\u20132011 Belgian political crisis|Partition of Belgium}}\n\nAfter World War II, the differences between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgians became clear in a number of conflicts, such as the [[Royal Question]], the question whether King Leopold III should return (which most Flemings supported but not the Walloons) and the use of Dutch in the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]]. As a result, several [[State reform in Belgium|state reforms]] took place in the second half of the 20th century, which transformed the unitary Belgium into a federal state with [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities, regions and language areas]]. This resulted also in the establishment of a [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government|Government]]. During the 1970s, all major political parties split into a Dutch and French-speaking party.\n\nSeveral Flemish parties still advocate for more Flemish autonomy, some even for Flemish independence (see [[Partition of Belgium]]), whereas the French-speakers would like to keep the current state as it is. Recent governments (such as [[Verhofstadt I Government]]) have transferred certain federal competences to the regional governments.\n\nOn 13 December 2006, a [[Flemish Secession hoax|spoof news broadcast]] by the Belgian Francophone public broadcasting station [[RTBF]] declared that Flanders had decided to declare independence from Belgium.\n\nThe [[Belgian federal election, 2007|2007 federal elections]] showed more support for Flemish autonomy, marking the start of the [[2007\u20132011 Belgian political crisis]]. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy gained votes as well as seats in the [[Belgian federal parliament]]. This was especially the case for [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] and [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) (who had participated on a shared [[electoral list]]). The trend continued during the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|2009 regional elections]], where CD&V and N-VA were the clear winners in Flanders, and N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 federal elections]], followed by the [[2010\u20132011 Belgian government formation|longest-ever government formation]] after which the [[Di Rupo I Government]] was formed excluding N-VA. Eight parties agreed on a [[Sixth Belgian state reform|sixth state reform]] which aim to solve the disputes between Flemings and French-speakers. The [[Belgian provincial and municipal elections, 2012|2012 provincial and municipal elections]] however continued the trend of N-VA becoming the biggest party in Flanders.\n\nHowever, sociological studies show no parallel between the rise of nationalist parties and popular support for their agenda. Instead, a recent study revealed a majority in favour of returning regional competences to the federal level.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20160124_02088008 |title=Staatshervorming richting Belgi\u00eb wint aan politieke steun |language=Dutch |trans-title=State reform towards Belgium is gaining political support\n|date=25 January 2016 |author=Peter De Lobel |work=De Standaard}}</ref>\n\n== Government and politics ==\n[[File:Kris Peeters 675.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kris Peeters]], former [[Minister-President of Flanders]], promoting [[Flanders in Action]]]]\n{{main|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}\n\nBoth the [[Flemish Community]] and the [[Flemish Region]] are constitutional institutions of the Kingdom of Belgium, exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of [[state reform in Belgium|state reforms]].

One of the first was the nationalist [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]], of which the right nationalist [[Vlaams Blok|Flemish Block]] (now [[Vlaams Belang|Flemish Interest]]) split off, and which later dissolved into the now-defunct Spirit or [[Social Liberal Party (Belgium)|Social Liberal Party]], moderate nationalism rather left of the spectrum, on the one hand, and the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA), more conservative but independentist, on the other hand. Other parties are the leftist alternative/ecological [[Groen!|Green]] party; the short-lived anarchistic libertarian spark [[ROSSEM]] and more recently the conservative-right liberal [[Lijst Dedecker|List Dedecker]], founded by [[Jean-Marie Dedecker]], and the socialist [[Workers' Party of Belgium|Workers' Party]].\n\nParticularly the [[Flemish Block]]/[[Flemish Interest]] has seen electoral success roughly around the turn of the century, and the [[New Flemish Alliance]] during the last few elections, becoming even the largest party in the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 federal elections]].\n\n=== Flemish independence ===\n[[File:Menen - Border crossing 1 cropped.jpg|thumb|Border crossing sign near [[Menen]].]]\n{{main|Flemish Movement}}\n\nFor some inhabitants, Flanders is more than just a geographical area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement even call it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, but most people (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even ''very proud'', while some 25% are not proud and 8% is ''very not proud''. Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them staying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in [[Service (economics)|services]], the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers - both housewives and house husbands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/drie-op-vier-vlamingen-zijn-trotse-belgen/article-1195114178145.htm|title=Drie op vier Vlamingen zijn trotse Belgen|work=knack.be}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the Flemish government drafted a \"Charter for Flanders\" (''Handvest voor Vlaanderen'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/docs/biblio/opendigibib/monografie/2012/280_handvest_voor_vlaanderen_20120524.pdf|format=pdf|title=Handvest voor Vlaanderen|website=vlaamsparlement.be}}</ref> of which the first article says ''\"Vlaanderen is een deelstaat van de federale Staat Belgi\u00eb en maakt deel uit van de Europese Unie.\"'' (\"Flanders is a [[federated state|component state]] of the federal State of Belgium and is part of the European Union\"). Although interpreted by many Flemish nationalists as a statement, this phrase is merely a quotation from the Belgian constitution and has no further legal value whatsoever.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further|Geography of Belgium}}\n[[File:Zonien.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sonian Forest]]]]\nFlanders shares its borders with Wallonia in the south, Brussels being an enclave within the Flemish Region. The rest of the border is shared with the [[Netherlands]] ([[Zeelandic Flanders]] in [[Zeeland]], [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]) in the north and east, and with [[France]] ([[French Flanders]] in [[Hauts-de-France]]) and the [[North Sea]] in the west. [[Voeren]] is an [[exclave]] of Flanders between Wallonia and the Netherlands, while [[Baarle-Hertog]] in Flanders forms a complicated series of enclaves and exclaves with [[Baarle-Nassau]] in the Netherlands. [[Germany]], although bordering Wallonia and close to [[Voeren]] in Limburg, does not share a border with Flanders. The [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], also close to Voeren, does not border Flanders either. (The commune of [[Plombi\u00e8res]], majority French speaking, lies between them.)\n\nFlanders is a highly urbanised area, lying completely within the [[Blue Banana]]. [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]] and [[Leuven]] are the largest cities of the [[Flemish Region]]. [[Antwerp]] has a population of more than 500,000 citizens and is the largest city, [[Ghent]] has a population of 250,000 citizens, followed by [[Bruges]] with 120,000 citizens and [[Leuven]] counts almost 100,000 citizens.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Brussels]] is a part of Flanders as far as community matters are concerned, but does not belong to the Flemish Region.\n\nFlanders has two main geographical regions: the coastal [[Yser]] basin plain in the north-west and a central plain. The first consists mainly of sand dunes and [[clay]]ey [[alluvial]] soils in the [[polder]]s. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by [[dike (construction)|dikes]] or, a little further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. With similar soils along the lowermost [[Scheldt]] basin starts the central plain, a smooth, slowly rising fertile area irrigated by many waterways that reaches an average height of about five metres (16.4&nbsp;ft) above sea level with wide valleys of its rivers upstream as well as the [[Campine]] region to the east having sandy soils at altitudes around thirty metres.{{efn |The altitude of Mechelen, approximately in the middle of the central plain forming the large part of Flanders, is {{cvt|7|m|ft}} above sea level.

Initially, the modernization relied heavily on food processing and textile. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846\u201350). After World War II, [[Antwerp]] and [[Ghent]] experienced a fast expansion of the [[chemical]] and petroleum industries. Flanders also attracted a large majority of foreign investments in Belgium. The [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] sent the economy into a recession. The steel industry remained in relatively good shape. In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of Belgium continued to shift further to Flanders and is now concentrated in the populous [[Flemish Diamond]] area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Het belang van de Vlaamse Ruit vanuit economisch perspectief ''The importance of the Flemish Diamond from an economical perspective''|language=Dutch|author=Vanhaverbeke, Wim|url=http://edata.ub.unimaas.nl/www-edocs/loader/file.asp?id=264|publisher=Netherlands Institute of Business Organization and Strategy Research, [[University of Maastricht]]|accessdate=19 May 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314033239/http://edata.ub.unimaas.nl/www-edocs/loader/file.asp?id=264| archivedate = 14 March 2007}}</ref> Nowadays, the Flemish economy is mainly service-oriented.\n\nBelgium is a founding member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1951, which evolved into the present-day [[European Union]].

According to the ''2001 Survey and Study of Religion'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Belgium|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2004|year=2004|publisher=US Department of State, [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35444.htm|accessdate=28 May 2007}}</ref> about 47 percent of the Belgian population identify themselves as belonging to the Catholic Church, while Islam is the second-largest religion at 3.5 percent.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered more religious than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious, and 36% believed that God created the world.<ref>Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organisation for Promotion and Communication), published in Knack magazine 22 November 2006 p. 14 [The Dutch language term 'gelovig' is in the text translated as 'religious', more precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of God in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, and/or in some [[afterlife]].</ref>\n\nJews [[History of the Jews in Belgium|have been present]] in Flanders for a long time, in particular [[History of the Jews in Antwerp|in Antwerp]].

Among the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] countries in 1999, Flanders had the third-highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in [[postsecondary education]]. Flanders also scores very high in international comparative studies on education. Its secondary school students consistently rank among the top three for mathematics and science. However, the success is not evenly spread: ethnic minority youth score consistently lower, and the difference is larger than in most comparable countries.{{efn |name=\"Note_Nationality-Minority-Education\"}}\n\nMirroring the historical political conflicts between the freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a [[subsidy|subsidised]] religious\u2014mostly Catholic\u2014branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they must be able to prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that\u2014at least for the [[Catholic school]]s\u2014the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation {{ill|VSKO|nl|Katholiek Onderwijs Vlaanderen}}. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. [[Waldorf education|Steiner]], [[Montessori]], or [[Freinet]]) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.\n\nDuring the school year 2003\u20132004, 68.30% of the total population of children between the ages of six and 18 went to subsidized private schools (both religious schools or 'methodical pedagogies' schools).<ref>{{cite web|title=Education in Flanders|work=A broad view of the Flemish educational landscape|year=2005|publisher=Ministry of the Flemish Community|url=http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/publicaties/2005/educationinflandersbroadview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe big freedom given to schools results in a constant competition to be the \"best\" school. The schools get certain reputations amongst parents and employers. So it's important for schools to be the best school since the subsidies depend on the number of pupils. This competition has been pinpointed as one of the main reasons for the high overall quality of the Flemish education. However, the importance of a school's reputation also makes schools more eager to expel pupils that don't perform well. Resulting in the ethnic differences and the well-known waterfall system: pupils start high in the perceived hierarchy, and then drop towards more professional oriented directions or \"easier\" schools when they can't handle the pressure any longer.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n{{Further|Healthcare in Belgium}}\n{{expand section|date=July 2012}}\nHealthcare is a federal matter, but the [[Flemish Government]] is responsible for care, health education and [[preventive care]].\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main|Dutch language|Flemish|Flemish people|Flemish Movement}}\nAt first sight, ''Flemish culture'' is defined by the [[Dutch language]] and its gourmandic mentality, as compared to the more Calvinistic Dutch culture. [[Dutch paintings|Dutch]] and [[Flemish painting]]s enjoyed more equal international admiration.\n\n=== Language and literature ===\n[[File:Guidogezelle.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Guido Gezelle|Gezelle]] in [[Bruges]], by sculptor [[Jules Lagae]]]]\n\nThe standard language in Flanders is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; spelling and grammar are regulated by a single authority, the [[Dutch Language Union]] (''Nederlandse Taalunie''), comprising a committee of ministers of the Flemish and Dutch governments, their advisory council of appointed experts, a controlling commission of 22 parliamentarians, and a secretariate.<ref name=\"Taalunie1\">{{Cite web| url = http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/wie_zijn_wij/ | title = De Taalunie \u2013 Wie zijn wij? | language = Dutch | publisher = Nederlandse Taalunie | accessdate =19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Taalunie2\">{{Cite web | url = http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/werkwijze_en_beleid/ | title = De Taalunie \u2013 Werkwijze en beleid | language = Dutch | publisher = Nederlandse Taalunie | accessdate =17 February 2011}}</ref> The term [[Flemish]] can be applied to the Dutch spoken in Flanders; it shows many regional and local variations.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://odur.let.rug.nl/~hoeksema/divid-4.ppt |format = ppt |title = College 4 \u2013 1830 Belgische onafhankelijkheid, Noord-Zuidverschillen, Dialecten en de rijksgrens, Frans-Vlaanderen |language = Dutch |author = Hoeksema, Jack |publisher = [[University of Groningen]] (host site) |accessdate =19 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest difference between Belgian Dutch and Dutch used in the Netherlands is in the pronunciation of words. The Dutch spoken in the north of the Netherlands is typically described as being \"sharper\", while Belgian Dutch is \"softer\". In Belgian Dutch, there are also fewer vowels pronounced as [[diphthongs]]. When it comes to spelling, Belgian Dutch language purists historically avoided writing words using a French spelling, or searched for specific translations of words derived from French, while the Dutch prefer to stick with French spelling, as it differentiates Dutch more from the neighbouring German. For example, the Dutch word \"punaise\" (English: ''[[Drawing pin]]'') is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word \"duimspijker\" (literally: ''thumb spike'') as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch. Other proposals by purists were sometimes accepted, and sometimes reverted again in later spelling revisions. As language purists were quite often professionally involved in language (e.g. as a teacher), these unofficial purist translations are found more often in Belgian Dutch texts.\n\nThe earliest example of literature in non-[[standardized dialect]]s in the current area of Flanders is [[Hendrik van Veldeke]]'s ''Eneas Romance'', the first courtly romance in a [[Germanic language]] (12th century). With a writer of [[Hendrik Conscience]]'s stature, [[Flemish literature]] rose ahead of French literature in Belgium's early history.<ref name=\"Letterkundig-Museum\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.letterkundigmuseum.nl/tabid/92/BiographyID/19/BiographyName/HendrikConscience/Mode/BiographyDetails/Default.aspx |title = Hendrik Conscience (biography) |language = Dutch |publisher = Letterkundig Museum, The Hague, The Netherlands |accessdate = 21 February 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094015/http://www.letterkundigmuseum.nl/tabid/92/BiographyID/19/BiographyName/HendrikConscience/Mode/BiographyDetails/Default.aspx |archivedate = 24 July 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Couttenier\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/cout003nati01_01/cout003nati01_01_0001.php\n |title = Nationale beelden in de Vlaamse literatuur van de negentiende eeuw |author = Couttenier, Piet |work = Nationalisme in Belgi\u00eb.

Their novels mostly describe rural life in Flanders in the 19th century and at beginning of the 20th. Widely read by the older generations, they are considered somewhat old-fashioned by present-day critics. Some famous Flemish writers of the early 20th century wrote in French, including Nobel Prize winners (1911) [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Emile Verhaeren]]. They were followed by a younger generation, including [[Paul van Ostaijen]] and [[Gaston Burssens]], who ''[[Activism|activated]]'' the [[Flemish Movement]].<ref name=de-Ridder/> Still widely read and translated into other languages (including English) are the novels of authors such as [[Willem Elsschot]], [[Louis Paul Boon]] and [[Hugo Claus]]. The recent crop of writers includes the novelists [[Tom Lanoye]] and [[Herman Brusselmans]], and poets such as the married couple [[Herman de Coninck]] and [[Kristien Hemmerechts]].\n\n==== Languages ====\n\nAt the creation of the Belgian state, French was the only official language. Historically Flanders was a Dutch-speaking region. For a long period, French was used as a [[second language]] and, like elsewhere in Europe, commonly spoken among the aristocracy. There is still a French-speaking minority in Flanders, especially in the [[municipalities with language facilities]], along the language border and the [[municipalities with language facilities#Rim municipalities|Brussels periphery]] (Vlaamse Rand), though many of them are French-speakers that migrated to Flanders in recent decades.\n\nIn [[French Flanders]], French is the only official language and now the native language of the majority of the population, but there is still a minority of Dutch-speakers living there. French is also the primary language in the officially bilingual [[Brussels Capital Region]], (see [[Francization of Brussels]]).\n\nMany Flemings are also able to speak French, children in Flanders generally get their first French lessons in the 5th primary year (normally around 10 years). But the current lack of French outside the educational context makes it hard to maintain a decent level of French. As such, the proficiency of French is declining. Flemish pupils are also obligated to follow English lessons as their third language. Normally from the second secondary year (around 14 years old), but the ubiquity of English in movies, music, IT and even advertisements makes it easier to learn and maintain the English language. This makes the Flemish people very proficient in English (in Europe, only Sweden and Malta have a better knowledge of English as a second language).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsmonkey.be/article/22936%7CExamens |title=Examens Frans, Engels en Duits moeten moeilijker worden volgens minister Crevits.

Flemish provinces each have up to two TV channels as well. Commercial television broadcasters include [[vtm]] and [[Vier]] (VT4). Popular TV series are for example ''[[Thuis]]'' and ''[[F.C. De Kampioenen]]''.\n\nThe five most successful Flemish films were ''[[Loft (2008 film)|Loft]]'' (2008; 1,186,071 visitors), ''[[Koko Flanel]]'' (1990; 1,082,000 tickets sold), ''[[Hector (1987 film)|Hector]]'' (1987; 933,000 tickets sold), ''[[Daens (film)|Daens]]'' (1993; 848,000 tickets sold) and ''[[The Alzheimer Case|De Zaak Alzheimer]]'' (2003; 750,000 tickets sold). The first and last ones were directed by [[Erik Van Looy]], and an American remake is being made of both of them, respectively ''[[The Loft (2012 film)|The Loft]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Memory of a Killer]]''. The other three ones were directed by [[Stijn Coninx]].\n\nNewspapers are grouped under three main publishers: [[De Persgroep]] with ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'', the most popular newspaper in Flanders, ''[[De Morgen]]'' and ''[[De Tijd]]''. Then [[Corelio]] with ''{{ill|De Gentenaar|nl}}'', the oldest extant Flemish newspaper, ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'' and ''[[De Standaard]]''. Lastly, [[Concentra]] publishes ''[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]'' and ''[[Het Belang van Limburg]]''.\n\nMagazines include ''[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]]'' and ''[[HUMO]]''.\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[File:Kim Clijsters 2006.jpg|thumb|Kim Clijsters was [[WTA Awards|WTA Player of the Year]] in 2005 and 2010]]\n{{Further|Sport in Belgium}}\n[[Association football]] (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in both parts of Belgium, together with cycling, tennis, swimming and judo.<ref>{{cite book|title=Belgium|author=George Wingfield|publisher=Infobase Publishing|editor=Charles F.

In a system based on [[single-member district]]s, it may be called [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP), '''single-choice voting''', '''simple plurality''' or '''relative/simple majority'''. In a system based on multi-member districts, it may be referred to as '''[[Winner-takes-all voting|winner-takes-all]]''' or [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc voting]]. The system is often used to elect members of a legislative assembly or executive officers. It is the most common form of the system, and is used in Canada, the lower house ([[Lok Sabha]]) in India, most elections in the United Kingdom (excluding some Scottish and Northern Irish elections), and most elections in the United States.\n\nPlurality voting is distinguished from a majoritarian electoral system, in which, to win, a candidate must receive an [[absolute majority]] of votes, i.e., more votes than all other candidates combined. Both systems may use [[single-member district|single-member]] or multi-member constituencies. In the latter case it may be referred to as an exhaustive counting system: one member is elected at a time and the process repeated until the number of vacancies is filled.\n\nIn some countries such as France (as well as in some jurisdictions of the United States, such as [[Louisiana]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) a \"two-ballot\" or \"runoff election\" plurality system is used. This may require [[Two-round system|two rounds]] of voting. If on the first round no candidate receives over 50% of the votes, then a second round takes place, with just the two highest-voted candidates in the first round. This ensures that the winner gains a majority of votes in the second round. Alternatively, all candidates above a certain threshold in the first round may compete in the second round. If there are more than two candidates standing, then a plurality vote may decide the result.\n\nIn [[political science]], the use of plurality voting with multiple, single-winner constituencies to elect a multi-member body is often referred to as '''single-member district plurality''' or '''SMDP'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/plurality.htm |title=Plurality-Majority Systems |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref> This combination is also variously referred to as winner-takes-all to contrast it with [[proportional representation]] systems. This term is sometimes also used to refer to elections for multiple winners in a particular constituency using bloc voting.\n\n==Voting==\n{{see also|Westminster system}}\nPlurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the [[United Nations]]. Plurality voting is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom and former British colonies, including the United States, Canada and India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/epic-en/es#ES05 |title=The Global Distribution of Electoral Systems |publisher=Aceproject.org |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>\n\nIn single winner plurality voting, each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate, and the winner of the election is whichever candidate represents a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of voters, that is, whoever received the largest number of votes. This makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials. (However the drawing of district boundary lines can be very contentious in this system.)\n\nIn an election for a legislative body, with single-member seats, each voter in a given geographically-defined [[Constituency|electoral district]] is entitled to vote for one candidate from a list of candidates competing to represent that district. Under the plurality system, the winner of the election then becomes the representative of the entire electoral district, and serves with representatives of other electoral districts.\n\nIn an election for a single seat, such as for [[president]] in a [[presidential system]], the same style of ballot is used and the winner is the candidate who receives the largest number of votes.\n\nIn the [[two-round system]], usually the two highest polling candidates in the first ballot progress to the second round [[Two-round system|Run-off]] ballot.\n\nIn a multiple member plurality election, with ''n'' seats available, the winners are the ''n'' candidates with the highest numbers of votes. The rules may allow the voter to vote for one candidate, or for up to ''n'' candidates, or maybe some other number.\n===Ballot types===\n[[File:Plurality ballot.svg|thumb|right|An example of a plurality ballot.]]\nGenerally plurality ballots can be categorized into two forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot where the name of a candidate(s) is written in by hand. A more structured ballot will list all the candidates and allow a mark to be made next to the name of a single candidate (or more than one, in some cases); however a structured ballot can also include space for a [[write-in candidate]].\n\n===Examples of plurality voting===\n\n====General elections in the United Kingdom====\nThe United Kingdom, like the United States and Canada, uses single-member districts as the base for [[UK general election|national elections]]. Each electoral district (constituency) chooses one [[member of parliament]], i.e. the candidate that gets the most votes, whether or not he/she gets 50% or more of the votes cast (\"first past the post\"). In 1992, for example, a [[Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections|Liberal Democrat in Scotland]] won a seat with just 26% of the votes. This system of single-member districts with plurality winners tends to produce two large political parties. (In countries with proportional representation there is not such a great incentive to vote for a large party, and that contributes to [[multi-party system]]s.)\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland use the first past the post system for UK general elections, but use versions of proportional representation for elections to their own assemblies/parliaments. All of the UK has used a form of proportional representation for European Parliament elections.\n\nThe countries that inherited the British majoritarian system tend toward two large parties: one left, the other right, such as the U.S. Democrats and Republicans. Canada is an exception, with three major political parties consisting of the New Democratic Party which is to the left, the Conservative Party which is to the right and the Liberal Party which is slightly off center to the left. A fourth party that no longer has major party status is the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party, which is territorial and concentrated in Quebec. New Zealand used the British system, and it too yielded two large parties. It also left many New Zealanders unhappy, because other viewpoints were ignored, so its parliament in 1993 adopted a new electoral law, modelled on [[Elections in Germany#Election system|Germany's system]] of proportional representation (PR) with a partial selection by constituencies. New Zealand soon developed a more complex party system.<ref>[[Michael Roskin|Roskin, Michael]], ''Countries and Concepts'' (2007)</ref>\n\nAfter the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 Elections in the United Kingdom]], there were calls from [[UKIP]] to change to proportional representation after receiving 3,881,129 votes but only 1 MP.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Reckless Out Amid UKIP Frustration At System|url = http://news.sky.com/story/1479845/reckless-out-amid-ukip-frustration-at-system|accessdate = 2015-05-08}}</ref> The Green Party was similarly under-represented. This contrasted greatly with the SNP in Scotland who only received 1,454,436 votes but won 56 seats, due to more concentrated support.\n\n====Example====\n{{Tenn voting example}}\n\nIf each voter in each city naively selects one city on the ballot (Memphis voters select Memphis, Nashville voters select Nashville, and so on), then Memphis will be selected, as it has the most votes '''(42%)'''. Note that this system does not require that the winner have a [[majority]] but only a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]]. Memphis wins because it has the most votes, even though '''58%''' of the voters in this example preferred Memphis least. Notice that this problem does not hold anymore in the [[two-round system]], in which Nashville would have won. (In practice, with FPTP, many voters in Chattanooga and Knoxville are likely to vote tactically for Nashville: see below.)\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\n===Tactical voting===\n{{See also|Tactical voting#Plurality_voting}}\nTo a much greater extent than many other electoral methods, plurality electoral systems encourage [[tactical voting]] techniques, like \"compromising\". Voters are pressured to vote for one of the two candidates they predict are most likely to win, even if their true preference is neither, because a vote for any other candidate will likely have no impact on the final result. Any other party will typically need to build up its votes and credibility over a series of elections before it is seen as electable.\n\nIn the [[Plurality voting#Example|Tennessee example]], if all the voters for Chattanooga and Knoxville had instead voted for Nashville, then Nashville would have won (with 58% of the vote); this would only have been the 3rd choice for those voters, but voting for their respective 1st choices (their own cities) actually results in their 4th choice (Memphis) being elected.\n\nThe difficulty is sometimes summed up, in an extreme form, as \"All votes for anyone other than the second place are votes for the winner\", because by voting for other candidates, they have denied those votes to the second place candidate who could have won had they received them. It is often claimed by United States [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] that Democrat [[Al Gore]] lost the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]] because some voters on the left voted for [[Ralph Nader]] of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]], who exit polls indicated would have preferred Gore at 45% to Bush at 27%, with the rest not voting in Nader's absence.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rosenbaum |first=David E. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4D6173CF937A15751C0A9629C8B63 |title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE INDEPENDENT; Relax, Nader Advises Alarmed Democrats, but the 2000 Math Counsels Otherwise |publisher=New York Times |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>\n\nSuch a mentality is reflected by elections in [[Puerto Rico]] and its three principal voter groups: the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party|Independentistas]] (pro-independence), the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Populares]] (pro-[[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]]), and the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|Estadistas]] (pro-[[U.S. state|statehood]]). Historically, there has been a tendency for Independentista voters to elect Popular candidates and policies. This phenomenon is responsible for some Popular victories, even though the Estadistas have the most voters on the island. It is so widely recognised that the Puerto Ricans sometimes call the Independentistas who vote for the Populares \"melons\", because the fruit is green on the outside but red on the inside (in reference to the party colors).\n\nBecause voters have to predict in advance who the top two candidates will be, this can cause significant perturbation to the system:\n\n*Substantial power is given to the media. Some voters will tend to believe the media's assertions as to who the leading contenders are likely to be in the election. Even voters who distrust the media will know that other voters ''do'' believe the media, and therefore those candidates who receive the most media attention will nonetheless be the most popular and thus most likely to be in one of the top two.\n*A newly appointed candidate, who is in fact supported by the majority of voters, may be considered (due to the lack of a track record) to not be likely to become one of the top two candidates; thus, they will receive a reduced number of votes, which will then give them a reputation as a low poller in future elections, compounding the problem.\n*The system may promote votes ''against'' more so than votes ''for''. In the UK, entire campaigns have been organised with the aim of voting ''against'' the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] by voting either [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] or [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]. For example, in a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] held by the Conservatives, with the Liberal Democrats as the second-place party and the Labour Party in third, Labour supporters might be urged to vote for the Liberal Democrat candidate (who has a smaller majority to close and more support in the constituency) than their own candidate on the basis that Labour supporters would prefer an MP from a competing left/liberal party than a Conservative one. Similarly in Labour/Lib Dem marginals where the Conservatives are third, Conservative voters may be encouraged or tempted to vote Lib Dem to keep defeat Labour.\n*If enough voters use this tactic, the first-past-the-post system becomes, effectively, [[Two-round system|runoff voting]]\u2014a completely different system\u2014where the first round is held in the court of public opinion; a good example of this is the [[Winchester by-election, 1997]].\n\nProponents of other single-winner electoral systems argue that their proposals would reduce the need for tactical voting and reduce the [[spoiler effect]]. Examples include the commonly used [[two-round system]] of runoffs and [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]], along with less tested systems such as [[approval voting]], [[score voting]] and [[Condorcet methods]].\n\n===Fewer political parties===\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Percentage graph UK POLITICS 2005.png|right|thumb|A graph showing the difference between the popular vote and the number of seats won by major political parties at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005]]]]\n\n[[Duverger's law]] is a theory that constituencies that use first-past-the-post systems will have a [[two-party system]], given enough time.<ref name=\"GrofmanBlais2009\">{{cite book|author1=Bernard Grofman|author2=Andr\u00e9 Blais|author3=Shaun Bowler|title=Duverger's Law of Plurality Voting: The Logic of Party Competition in Canada, India, the United Kingdom and the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BudCN3zBCoC|date=5 March 2009|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-09720-6}}</ref>\n\nFirst-past-the-post tends to reduce the number of political parties to a greater extent than most other methods do, making it more likely that a single party will hold a majority of legislative seats. (In the [[United Kingdom]], 21 out of 24 General Elections since 1922 have produced a single-party majority government.)\n\nFPTP's tendency toward fewer parties and more frequent one-party rules can also produce government that may not consider as wide a range of perspectives and concerns. It is entirely possible that a voter finds all major parties to have similar views on issues and that a voter does not have a meaningful way of expressing a dissenting opinion through his vote.\n\nAs fewer choices are offered to voters, voters may vote for a candidate although they disagree with him, because they disagree even more with his opponents. Consequently, candidates will less closely reflect the viewpoints of those who vote for them.\n\nFurthermore, one-party rule is more likely to lead to radical changes in government policy even though the changes are favoured only by a plurality or a bare majority of the voters, whereas a multi-party system usually require greater consensus in order to make dramatic changes in policy.\n\n===Wasted votes===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}\n[[Wasted vote]]s are votes cast for losing candidates or votes cast for winning candidates in excess of the number required for victory. For example, in the [[UK General Election of 2005]], 52% of votes were cast for losing candidates and 18% were excess votes\u2014a total of 70% wasted votes. This is perhaps the most fundamental criticism of FPTP, that a large majority of votes may play no part in determining the outcome. Alternative electoral systems attempt to ensure that almost all votes are effective in influencing the result and the number of wasted votes is consequently minimised.\n\n===Gerrymandering===\nBecause FPTP permits a high level of [[wasted vote]], an election under FPTP is easily gerrymandered unless safeguards are in place. In [[gerrymandering]], constituencies are deliberately designed to unfairly increase the number of seats won by one party at the expense of another.\n\nIn brief, suppose that governing party G wishes to reduce the seats that will be won by opposition party O in the next election. It creates a number of constituencies in each of which O has an overwhelming majority of votes. O will win these seats, but a large number of its voters will waste their votes. Then the rest of the constituencies are designed to have small majorities for G. Few G votes are wasted, and G will win a large number of seats by small margins. As a result of the gerrymander, O's seats have cost it more votes than G's seats.\n\n===Manipulation charges===\nThe presence of [[spoiler (politician)|spoiler]]s '''often''' gives rise to suspicions that [[strategic nomination|manipulation of the slate]] has taken place. The spoiler may have received incentives to run. A spoiler may also drop out at the last moment, inducing charges that such an act was intended from the beginning.\n\n===Spoiler effect===\n{{main|Spoiler effect}}\nThe '''spoiler effect''' is the effect of vote splitting between candidates or ballot questions with similar ideologies. One '''<nowiki>spoiler candidate'</nowiki>'''s presence in the election draws votes from a major candidate with similar politics thereby causing a strong opponent of both or several to win. Smaller parties can disproportionately change the outcome of an FPTP election by swinging what is called the 50-50% balance of two party systems, by creating a [[political faction|faction]] within one or both ends of the [[political spectrum]] which shifts the winner of the election from an [[absolute majority]] outcome to a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]] outcome favouring the previously less favoured party. In comparison, for electoral systems using [[proportional representation]] small groups win only their proportional share of representation.\n\n===Issues specific to particular countries===\n\n====Solomon Islands====\nIn August 2008, Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]] commented on what he perceived as the flaws of a first-past-the-post electoral system in the [[Solomon Islands]]:\n{{quote|''An[...] underlying cause of political instability and poor governance, in my opinion, is our electoral system and its related problems. It has been identified by a number of academics and practitioners that the First Past the Post system is such that a Member elected to Parliament is sometimes elected by a small percentage of voters where there are many candidates in a particular constituency. I believe that this system is part of the reason why voters ignore political parties and why candidates try an appeal to voters' material desires and relationships instead of political parties. [...] Moreover, this system creates a political environment where a Member is elected by a relatively small number of voters with the effect that this Member is then expected to ignore his party\u2019s philosophy and instead look after that core base of voters in terms of their material needs. Another relevant factor that I see in relation to the electoral system is the proven fact that it is rather conducive, and thus has not prevented, corrupt elections practices such as ballot buying.''|[http://solomonstarnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3184&change=103&changeown=89&Itemid=45 \"Realising political stability\"], Sir Peter Kenilorea, ''Solomon Star'', 30 August 2008}}\n\n==Advantages==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Preservation of \"one person, one vote\" principle===\nThe arguments for plurality voting  rely on the preservation of the \"one person, one vote\" principle (also \"one man, one vote\", or OMOV, or more recently \"one member, one vote\"), as [[Reynolds v. Sims|cited]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], wherein each voter is only able to cast one vote in a given election, where that vote can only go to one candidate. Plurality voting elects the candidate who is preferred first by the largest number of voters, although this need not be an absolute majority. Other electoral systems, such as [[instant-runoff voting]], [[party-list proportional representation]] or [[single transferable vote]] also preserve OMOV, but it is not as obvious that they do so, because they rely on lower voter preference to enable a candidate to earn either an [[absolute majority]] (single member [[Electoral district|district]]) or a [[Election threshold|quota]] (multi-member district), respectively.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Advantages compared to proportional representation===\nPlurality is often conflated with single-winner electoral systems in general, in order to contrast it with [[proportional representation]]. In this context, it shares advantages, such as local accountability, with other single-winner systems.\n\n==International examples==\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] continues to use the first-past-the-post electoral system for general elections, and for local government elections in England and Wales. Changes to the UK system have been proposed, and alternatives were examined by the [[Jenkins Commission (UK)|Jenkins Commission]] in the late 1990s. After the formation of a new [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition|coalition government]] in 2010, it was announced as part of the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement|coalition agreement]] that a [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|referendum]] would be held on switching to the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote system]]. However the alternative vote system was rejected 2-1 by British voters in a [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|referendum held on 5 May 2011]].\n\n[[Canada]] also uses FPTP for national and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] elections. In May 2005 the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] had a referendum on abolishing single-member district plurality in favour of multi-member districts with the [[Single transferable vote|Single Transferable Vote]] system after the [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform]] made a recommendation for the reform. The referendum obtained 57% of the vote, but failed to meet the 60% requirement for passing. An [[Ontario electoral reform referendum, 2007|October 2007 referendum]] in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] on adopting a [[mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] system, also requiring 60% approval, failed with only 36.9% voting in favour.\n\n[[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are notable examples of countries within the UK, or with previous links to it, that use non-FPTP electoral systems (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales use FPTP in United Kingdom general elections, however).\n\nNations which have undergone democratic reforms since 1990 but have not adopted the FPTP system include [[South Africa]], almost all of the former [[Eastern bloc]] nations, [[Russia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].\n\n===List of countries===\n{{See also|List of electoral systems by country}}\nCountries that use plurality voting to elect the lower or only house of their legislature include:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Electoral Systems|url = http://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDTable?question=ES005|publisher= ACE Electoral Knowledge Network| accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Antigua and Barbuda]]\n*[[Azerbaijan]]\n*[[Bahamas]]\n*[[Barbados]]\n*[[Bangladesh]]\n*[[Belize]]\n*[[Bermuda]]\n*[[Bhutan]]\n*[[Botswana]]\n*[[Canada]]\n*[[Congo (Brazzaville)]]\n*[[Cote d'Ivoire]]\n*[[Cook Islands]]\n*[[Comoros]]\n*[[Dominica]]\n*[[Eritrea]]\n*[[Ethiopia]]\n*[[Gabon]]\n*[[Grenada]]\n*[[Ghana]]\n*[[Gambia]]\n*[[India]]\n*[[Iran]]\n*[[Jamaica]]\n*[[Kenya]]\n*[[Kuwait]]\n*[[Lao People's Democratic Republic]]\n*[[Saint Lucia]]\n*[[Liberia]]\n*[[Marshall Islands]]\n*[[Burma (Myanmar)]]\n*[[Maldives]]\n*[[Malawi]]\n*[[Malaysia]]\n*[[Micronesia]]\n*[[Nigeria]]\n*[[Niue]]\n*[[Oman]]\n*[[Palau]]\n*[[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]\n*[[Saint Lucia]]\n*[[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n*[[Samoa]]\n*[[Solomon Islands]]\n*[[Seychelles]]\n*[[Sierra Leone]]\n*[[Singapore]]\n*[[Swaziland]]\n*[[Tanzania]]\n*[[Tonga]]\n*[[Trinidad and Tobago]]\n*[[Tuvalu]]\n*[[Uganda]]\n*[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]\n*[[United States]]\n*[[Yemen]]\n*[[Zambia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Texas gubernatorial election, 2006]] - Example of an incumbent governor, [[Rick Perry]], winning re-election despite gaining less than 40 percent of the vote\n*[[Cube rule]]\n*[[Deviation from proportionality]]\n*[[Plurality-at-large voting]]\n*[[Portal:Politics|List of democracy and elections-related topics]]\n*[[Instant-runoff voting]]\n*[[Approval Voting]]\n*[[Score voting]]\n*[[Single non-transferable vote]]\n*[[Single transferable vote]]\n*[[Two-round system|Runoff voting]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[http://www.prsa.org.au/pluralit.htm The fatal flaws of Plurality (first-past-the-post) electoral systems] - Proportional Representation Society of Australia\n\n{{voting systems}}\n\n[[Category:Electoral systems]]", "sha1": "sfqom6gv86qcmtlpf9u11pjka0yhciy"}}, {"title": "Fetish", "ns": "0", "id": "10881", "revision": {"id": "865554541", "parentid": "865553552", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T16:58:36Z", "contributor": {"ip": "84.52.237.152"}, "comment": "/* Anthropological uses */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary|fetish}}\n'''Fetish''' may refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Anthropological uses==\n* [[Fetishism]], the attribution of religious or mystical qualities to inanimate objects, known as fetishes\n* [[Zuni fetishes]], small carvings from various stones made by the Zuni Indians\n* [[Imiut fetish]], in ancient Egypt a stuffed, headless animal skin tied by the tail to a pole\n* [[Fetish priest]], in countries of West Africa, a person who serves as a mediator between the spirit and the living\n\n==Sexual==\n* [[Sexual fetishism]], a sexual attraction to objects or body parts of lesser sexual importance (or none at all) such as feet, toes or certain types of clothing\n* [[Fetish subculture]], a social movement constructed around sexual fetishism\n* [[Fetish magazine]], a type of erotic magazine\n* [[Fetish art]]\n** [[List of fetish artists]]\n* [[Fetish fashion]]\n\n==Arts==\n* [[Fetish (album)|''Fetish'' (album)]] (1999), by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts\n* [[Fetish (song)|\"Fetish\" (song)]] (2017), by Selena Gomez\n* Fetish, a fictional superheroine in the ''[[Bomb Queen]]'' series\n* ''[[The Great Fetish]]'', a science fiction novel by L.

It can be considered the second stage of [[economic integration]].\n\n==Description==\nUnlike a [[customs union]] (the third stage of economic integration), members of a [[free trade]] area do not have a [[common external tariff]], which means they have different quotas and [[customs (tax)|customs taxes]], as well as other policies with respect to non-members. To avoid tariff evasion (through [[re-exportation]]) the countries use the system of certification of origin most commonly called [[rules of origin]], where there is a  requirement for the minimum extent of local material inputs and local transformations adding [[Value (economics)|value]] to the goods. Only goods that meet these minimum requirements are entitled to the special treatment envisioned by the free trade area provisions.\n\n\"Cumulation\" is the relationship between different FTAs regarding the rules of origin{{snd}} sometimes different FTAs supplement each other, in other cases there is no cross-cumulation between the FTAs. A free-trade area is a result of a free-trade agreement (a form of [[trade pact]]) between two or more countries. Free-trade areas and agreements (FTAs) are cascadable to some degree{{snd}} if some countries sign agreements to form a free-trade area and choose to negotiate together (either as a [[trade bloc]] or as a forum of individual members of their FTA) another free-trade agreement with another country (or countries){{snd}} then the new FTA will consist of the old FTA plus the new country (or countries).\n\nWithin an industrialized country there are usually few if any significant barriers to the easy exchange of goods and services between parts of that country.  For example, there are usually no trade [[tariff]]s or import quotas; there are usually no delays as goods pass from one part of the country to another (other than those that distance imposes); there are usually no differences of taxation and regulation. Between countries, on the other hand, many of these barriers to the easy exchange of goods often do occur.  It is commonplace for there to be import duties of one kind or another (as goods enter a country) and the levels of sales tax and regulation often vary by country.\n\nThe aim of a free-trade area is to reduce barriers to exchange so that trade can grow as a result of specialisation, division of labour, and most importantly via [[comparative advantage]]. The theory of comparative advantage argues that in an unrestricted marketplace (in equilibrium) each source of production will tend to specialize in that activity where it has comparative (rather than absolute) advantage. The theory argues that the net result will be an increase in income and ultimately wealth and well-being for everyone in the free-trade area. The theory refers only to aggregate wealth and says nothing about the distribution of wealth; in fact there may be significant losers, in particular among the recently protected industries with a comparative disadvantage. The overall gains from trade can be used to compensate for the effects of reduced trade barriers by appropriate inter-party transfers.\n\n==Lists of free-trade areas==\n{{World economic integration}}\n\n* [[List of bilateral free trade agreements]]\n* [[List of multilateral free trade agreements]]\n* [[Free trade areas in Europe]]\n\nEvery [[customs union]], trade [[common market]], [[economic union]], [[customs and monetary union]] and [[economic and monetary union]] also has a free-trade area, but these are each listed in their own articles only.\n\n==Qualifying for a free-trade agreement==\n{{Further|Rules of origin}}\n\n* \"De Minimis\" states that a finished good will not be disqualified from preferential treatment if the non-originating content of that finished good is 7% or less of the transaction value of the good on an FOB basis (or its weight, depending on the type of good). \n* \"Regional Value Content\" is a calculated percentage of the value of the product that represents its North American content \n* \"Tariff Shift\" is a substantial transformation that takes place in a NAFTA country A finished good must qualify under one of these rules to be eligible for free trade under NAFTA. This is just one example of a qualification for a free-trade agreement. If a certificate of origin is present from a supplier demonstrating that the good originated in a country under the associated free trade agreement, no further calculations are needed. When qualifying products for an FTA, the use of an automated system allows importers to stay up-to-date on international compliance regulations, as well as solicit suppliers via the web instead of manually.

[[Deep frying]] submerges food in hot fat, most commonly oil.

Through the nineteenth century, fried potatoes became common enough that songs and engravings took the \u201cFried Potato Vendor\u201d as a popular subject. But at first these were cut in rounds. In 1865, Gogu\u00e9, in France, wrote to cut them either round or \u201cin long and squared pieces\u201d; in 1870, Cauderlier, in Belgium, also offered both options. Given the lag between practice and print, one cannot say that the five years\u2019 difference is significant; the most likely hypothesis is that the practice grew up spontaneously and spread across both countries.<ref>Jim Chevallier, A History of the Food of Paris: From Roast Mammoth to Steak Frites, 2018, {{ISBN|1442272821}}, pp. 186-187</ref> Some other sources refer to the old-English verb ''to french'', meaning ''to cut lengthwise'', as the origin of the name.

Each team plays with eleven players, including the goalie. Players use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic ball. The length of the stick depends on the player's individual height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longstreth.com/How-to-Choose-a-Stick/products/1951/ |title=How to Choose a Stick |website=Longstreth.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> Only one end of the stick is allowed to be used. Goalies often have a different kind of stick, however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts, a mouth guard and a jersey.\nToday, the game is played globally, with particular popularity throughout [[Western Europe]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States (primarily [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eisen|first1=Matt|title=In America, field hockey still toils in obscurity|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/10/12/in-america-field-hockey-still-toils-in-obscurity/|accessdate=February 4, 2017|work=[[Yale Daily News]]|date=October 12, 2006|quote=The American game is regionally centered.

If the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick, it will result in a penalty. Goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick. Whoever scores the most [[goal (sport)|goal]]s by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's format. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league and tournament play. In college play, a seven-aside overtime period consists of a 10-minute [[golden goal]] period with seven players for each team. If a tie still remains, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses 5 players to dribble from the 25-yard line down to the circle against the opposing goalie. The player has 8 seconds to score on the goalie keeping it in bounds. The play ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one on one) or time expires. If the tie still persists extra rounds thereafter until one team has scored.\n\nThe governing body of hockey is the [[International Hockey Federation|International Hockey Federation (FIH, in French)]], with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIH Hockey World League|World League]], [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] and [[Junior Hockey World Cup|Junior World Cup]], with many countries running extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organising the [[Hockey Rules Board]] and developing the [[Sport rule|rules]] for the game.\n\nA popular variant of field hockey is [[indoor field hockey]], which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, with a field which is reduced to approximately {{convert|40|x|20|m|abbr=on}}. With many of the rules remaining the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: Players may not raise the ball unless shooting on goal, players may not hit the ball (instead using pushes to transfer the ball), and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers which the ball will rebound off.<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\">{{cite web|title=Field Hockey Rules|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202012-interactif.pdf|publisher=International Hockey Federation}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Field hockey history}}\n[[File:Relief pentelic marble \"Ball Players\" 510-500 BC, NAMA 3476 102587.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Relief of 510 BC depicting [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] players of ''ker\u0113t\u00edzein'', an ancestral form of hockey or [[ground billiards]]; in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]\nThere is a depiction of a hockey-like game in [[Ancient Greece]], dating to c.&nbsp;510&nbsp;BC, when the game may have been called {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} (''ker\u0113t\u00edzein'') because it was played with a horn ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2}}, ''k\u00e9ras'', in [[Ancient Greek]]) and a ball.<ref>Oikonomos, G. \"\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\" Archaiologikon Deltion 6 (1920\u20131921): 56 -59; there are clear depictions of the game, but the identification with the name \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is [http://sarantakos.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/keretizein/ disputed] ([http://hellenisteukontos.blogspot.com/2010/03/ancient-greek-field-hockey.html English summary]).</ref> <!--Begin block of material sourced to Stein & Rubino.-->Researchers disagree over how to interpret this image.

By the 12th century, a team ball game called ''{{lang|frm|[[la soule]]}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|choule}}'', akin to a chaotic and sometimes long-distance version of hockey or [[rugby football]] (depending on whether sticks were used in a particular local variant), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes. <!--Being block of text cited to Stein & Rubino.-->Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Early Modern era]], such games often involved the local clergy or secular [[aristocracy]], and in some periods were limited to them by various anti-gaming edicts, or even banned altogether.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />  Stein and Rubino, among others, ultimately trace aspects of these games both to rituals in antiquity involving [[Globus cruciger|orbs]] and [[sceptre]]s (on the aristocratic and clerical side), and to ancient [[military training exercise]]s (on the popular side); [[polo]] (essentially hockey on horseback) was devised by the [[Ancient Persia]]ns for [[cavalry]] training, based on the local proto-hockey foot game of the region.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\nThe word ''hockey'' itself has no clear origin. One belief is that it was recorded in 1363 when [[Edward III]] of England issued the proclamation: \"Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games.\"<ref name=exp>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm |title=Rugby Football History |publisher=Rugby Football History |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> The belief is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games \"Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam\". It may be recalled at this point that ''baculum'' is the Latin for 'stick', so the reference would appear to be to a game played with sticks. The English historian and biographer [[John Strype]] did not use the word \"hockey\" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, and the word 'hockey' remains of unknown origin.\n\nThe modern game grew from English [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] in the early 19th century. The first club was in 1849 at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in south-east [[London]], but the modern rules grew out of a version played by [[Middlesex]] [[cricket]] clubs for winter game.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} [[Teddington]] Hockey Club formed the modern game by introducing the striking circle and changing the ball to a sphere from a rubber cube.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3BNMr7U8e9wC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22Hockey%22+circle+Teddington&source=bl&ots=L1sdZllpDV&sig=ztRqdfmNq6rFPyN-WLC2AzqjSGs&hl=en&ei=HEDATJfoEcK4jAegoPXRCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Hockey%22%20circle%20Teddington&f=false |first=Tracie |last=Egan |first2=Helen |last2=Connolly |title=Field Hockey: Rules, Tips, Strategy, and Safety |date=2005 |isbn=978-1-4042-0182-8 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |access-date=2014-02-27}}</ref> The Hockey Association was founded in 1886.

Synthetic pitches changed most aspects of field hockey, gaining speed. New tactics and techniques such as the [[Indian dribble]] developed, followed by new rules to take account. The switch to synthetic surfaces ended Indian and Pakistani domination because artificial turf was too expensive in [[Developing country|developing countries]].  Since the 1970s, Australia, the Netherlands, Pakistan and Germany have dominated at the Olympics and World Cup stages.\n\nWomen's field hockey was first played at British universities and schools.

This led to the International Federation of Women's Hockey Association (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include many continental European countries where women played as sections of men's associations and were affiliated to the FIH. The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975.\n\nBy the early 1970s, there were 22 associations with women's sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA. Discussions started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive field hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women's field hockey to the Olympic games from 1980 where, as in the men's game, The Netherlands, Germany, and Australia have been consistently strong. Argentina has emerged as a team to be reckoned with since 2000, winning the world championship in 2002 and 2010 and medals at the last three Olympics.\n\nOutside North America, participation is now fairly evenly balanced between men and women. For example, in England, [[England Hockey]] reports that as of the 2008\u201309 season there were 2488 registered men's teams, 1969 women's teams, 1042 boys' teams, 966 girls' teams and 274 mixed teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=70&sectionTitle=Clubs |title=Clubs |work=EnglandHockey.co.uk |publisher=England Hockey Board |accessdate=10 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817214039/http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=70&sectionTitle=Clubs |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2006 the [[Irish Hockey Association]] reported that the gender split among its players was approximately 65% female and 35% male.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,1181-180298-197516-38886-258897-custom-item,00.html |title=Ireland |work=FIHockey.org |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> In its 2008 census, [[Hockey Australia]] reported 40,534 male club players and 41,542 female.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockey.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Census/2008NationalHockeyCensusExecSummary_Board.pdf |title=National Census Executive Summary 2008 |work=Hockey.org.ca |publisher=Hockey Australia |page=2 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022091719/http://www.hockey.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Census/2008NationalHockeyCensusExecSummary_Board.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  However, in the United States of America, there are few field hockey clubs, most play taking place between high school or college sides, consisting almost entirely of women. The strength of college field hockey reflects the impact of [[Title IX]] which mandated that colleges should fund men's and women's games programmes comparably.\n\nThe game's roots in the English public girls' school mean that the game is associated in the UK with active or overachieving [[middle class]] and [[upper class]] women. For example, in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s novel set in a totalitarian London, main character [[Winston Smith]] initially dislikes Julia, the woman he comes to love, because of \"the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=George |last=Orwell |author-link=George Orwell |title=Nineteen Eighty-Four |at=Part I, Ch. 1 |origyear=1949 |date=9 November 2011 |url= http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four/Part_I/Chapter_1 |via=WikiLivres.ca |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game of field hockey is also very present in the United States.  Many high schools and colleges in the U.S. offer the sport and in some areas it is even offered for youth athletes. It has been predominantly played on the East Coast, specifically the Northeast in states such as New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. It recent years however it has become increasingly present on the West Coast and in the Midwest.  Field hockey is still not played much in the Southern states of the U.S. but it is offered at a few colleges in Tennessee and Kentucky.\n\n==Field of play==\n{{Main|Field hockey pitch}}\n[[File:Hockey field metric.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Diagram of a hockey field]]\nMost hockey field dimensions were originally fixed using whole numbers of [[imperial measure]]s. Nevertheless, metric measurements are now the official dimensions as laid down by the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH) in the \"Rules of Hockey\". The pitch is a {{convert|91.4|x|55|m|yd|abbr=on}} rectangular field. At each end is a goal {{convert|2.14|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|3.66|m|0|abbr=on}} wide, as well as lines across the field {{convert|22.90|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} from each end-line (generally referred to as the 23-metre lines or the 25-yard lines) and in the center of the field. A spot {{convert|0.15|m|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, called the penalty spot or stroke mark, is placed with its centre {{convert|6.40|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} from the centre of each goal. The shooting circle is {{convert|16|yd|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the base line.\n\n===Playing surface===\nHistorically the game developed on natural grass turf. In the early 1970s, \"[[artificial turf|synthetic grass]]\" fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at [[Montreal]] in [[Field hockey at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]. Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and for most national competitions. While hockey is still played on traditional grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic surfaces almost everywhere in the western world. There are three main types of artificial hockey surface:<ref name=\"GB Pitches\">{{cite web|url=http://greatbritainhockey.co.uk/library-media/documents/Hockey%20Pitch%20Basic%20Info.pdf|title=Hockey Pitches \u2013 Basic Information|publisher=[[Great Britain Hockey]]|format=PDF|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.8 \u00a72}}{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.19 \u00a75.5.1}}\n\n*Unfilled or water based - artificial fibres that are densely packed for stabilisation, requires irrigation or watering to avoid pitch wear\n*Dressed or sand dressed - artificial fibres can be less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for part of the [[Pile (textile)|pile depth]]\n*Filled or sand filled - artificial fibres can be longer and less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for 100% of the pile depth\n\nSince the 1970s, sand-based pitches have been favoured as they dramatically speed up the game. However, in recent years there has been a massive increase in the number of \"water-based\" artificial turfs. Water-based synthetic turfs enable the ball to be transferred more quickly than on sand-based surfaces. It is this characteristic that has made them the surface of choice for international and national league competitions. Water-based surfaces are also less abrasive than sand-based surfaces and reduce the level of injury to players when they come into contact with the surface. The FIH are now{{when|date=January 2015}} proposing that new surfaces being laid should be of a hybrid variety which require less watering. This is due to the negative ecological effects of the high water requirements of water-based synthetic fields. It has also been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent countries who could afford these new pitches.<ref name=\"TOI\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/headon/entry/the-untold-story-of-how-india-lost-hockey-supremacy|title=The untold story of how India lost hockey supremacy|first=Minhaz|last=Merchant|date=15 January 2013|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rules and play==\nThe game is played between two teams of whom eleven, 10 field players and one goal keeper, are permitted to be on the pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper, which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after the inserter touches the ball to put somebody back in.\n\nPlayers are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke.\n\nThe flat side is always on the \"natural\" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. Left-handed sticks are rare, but available; however they are pointless as the rules forbid their use in a game. To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180\u00b0 (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head through approximately 90\u00b0 from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head).\n\nEdge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year \"experimental period\", twice the usual length of an \"experimental trial\" and is still a matter of some controversy within the game. Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of hit is now more commonly referred to as the \"forehand sweep\" where the ball is hit with the flat side or \"natural\" side of the stick and not the rounded edge.\n\nOther rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball, play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party.\n\n=== The game ===\nA match ordinarily consists of two periods of 35 minutes and a halftime interval of 5 minutes.  Other periods and interval may be agreed by\nboth teams except as specified in Regulations for particular competitions. <ref>http://www.fih.ch/media/12236728/fih-rules-of-hockey-2017.pdf</ref>  Since 2014, some International games have four 15 minute quarters with 2 minutes break between each quarter and 15 minutes break between quarter two and three. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games Held on the Gold Coast in Brisbane, Australia the hockey games for both men and women had four 15 minute quarters. The game begins with a pass back from the centre-forward usually to the centre-half back from the halfway line, the opposing team can not try to tackle this play until the ball has been pushed back. The team consists of eleven players, the players are usually set up as follows: Goalkeeper, Left Fullback, Right Fullback, 3 half-backs and 5 forwards consisting of Left Wing, Left Inner, Centre-Forward, Right Inner and Right Wing. These positions can change and adapt throughout the course of the game depending on the attacking and defensive style of the opposition. <ref>http://kingslangleyhockey.org.au/doc/JnrPosPlayDraft5.pdf</ref>\n\n===Positions===\n[[File:UVA field hockey.jpg|thumb|A [[Virginia Cavaliers]] field player passing the ball]]\nWhen hockey positions are discussed, notions of fluidity are very common. Each team can be fielded with a maximum of 11 players and will typically arrange themselves into forwards, midfielders, and defensive players (fullbacks)  with players frequently moving between these lines with the flow of play. Each team may also play with:\n\n''* a goalkeeper who wears a different color shirt and full protective equipment comprising at least headgear, leg guards and kickers; this player is referred to in the rules as a goalkeeper; or''\n\n''* a field player with goalkeeping privileges wearing a different color shirt and who may wear protective headgear (but not leg guards and kickers or other goalkeeping protective equipment) when inside their defending 23m area; they must wear protective headgear when defending a penalty corner or stroke; this player is referred to in the rules as a player with goalkeeping privileges; or''\n\n''* Only field players; no player has goalkeeping privileges or wears a different color shirt; no player may wear protective headgear except a face mask when defending a penalty corner or stroke.''<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\"/>\n\n====Formations====\nAs hockey has a very dynamic style of play, it is difficult to simplify positions to the static [[Formation (association football)|formation]]s which are common in [[association football|football]]. Although positions will typically be categorized as either fullback, halfback, midfield/inner or striker, it is important for players to have an understanding of every position on the field. For example, it is not uncommon to see a halfback overlap and end up in either attacking position, with the midfield and strikers being responsible for re-adjusting to fill the space they left. Movement between lines like this is particularly common across all positions.\n\nThis fluid Australian culture of hockey has been responsible for developing an international trend towards players occupying spaces on the field, not having assigned positions. Although they may have particular spaces on the field which they are more comfortable and effective as players, they are responsible for occupying the space nearest them. This fluid approach to hockey and player movement has made it easy for teams to transition between formations such as; ''\"3 at the back\"'', ''\"2 centre halves\"'', ''\"5 at the front\",'' and more.\n\n====Goalkeepers====\nWhen the ball is inside the circle they are defending and they have their stick in their hand, goalkeepers wearing full protective equipment are permitted to use their stick, feet, kickers or leg guards to propel the ball and to use their stick, feet, kickers, leg guards or any other part of their body to stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. Similarly, field players are permitted to use their stick. They are not allowed to use their feet and legs to propel the ball, stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. However, neither goalkeepers, or players with goalkeeping privileges are permitted to conduct themselves in a manner which is dangerous to other players by taking advantage of the protective equipment they wear.<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\"/>\n\nNeither goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges may lie on the ball, however, they are permitted to use arms, hands and any other part of their body to push the ball away. Lying on the ball deliberately will result in a penalty stroke, whereas if an umpire deems a goalkeeper has lain on the ball accidentally (e.g. it gets stuck in their protective equipment), a penalty corner is awarded.\n\n''* The action above is permitted only as part of a goal saving action or to move the ball away from the possibility of a goal scoring action by opponents. It does not permit a goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges to propel the ball forcefully with arms, hands or body so that it travels a long distance''\n\nWhen the ball is outside the circle they are defending, goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges are only permitted to play the ball with their stick. Further, a goalkeeper, or player with goalkeeping privileges who is wearing a helmet, must not take part in the match outside the 23m area they are defending, except when taking a penalty stroke. A goalkeeper must wear protective headgear at all times, except when taking a penalty stroke.\n\n===General play===\nFor the purposes of the rules, all players on the team in possession of the ball are attackers, and those on the team without the ball are defenders, yet throughout the game being played you are always \"defending\" your goal and \"attacking\" the opposite goal.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/field-hockey-elizabeth-anders/1101100144 |title=No Results Page &#124; Barnes & Noble |website=Barnesandnoble.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brenda256.jpg|thumb|right|Sideline hit in a match Standard Athletic Club vs. British School of Paris (1996)]]\nThe match is officiated by two field [[umpire (field hockey)|umpires]]. Traditionally each umpire generally controls half of the field, divided roughly diagonally. These umpires are often assisted by a technical bench including a timekeeper and record keeper.\n\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or whether to start with the ball. Since 2017 the game consists of four periods of 15 minutes with a 2-minute break after every period, and a 15-minute break at half time before changing ends. At the start of each period, as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. All players must start in their defensive half (apart from the player making the pass), but the ball may be played in any direction along the floor. Each team starts with the ball in one half, and the team that conceded the goal has possession for the restart. Teams trade sides at halftime.\n\nField players may only play the ball with the face of the stick. If the back side of the stick is used, it is a penalty and the other team will get the ball back. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or the other person's stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalized if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body to push a defender out of the way.\n\nField players may not play the ball with their feet, but if the ball accidentally hits the feet, and the player gains no benefit from the contact, then the contact is not penalized. Although there has been a change in the wording of this rule from 1 January 2007, the current FIH umpires' briefing instructs umpires not to change the way they interpret this rule.<ref name=\"Umpires' briefing\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |title=Title of presentation |publisher=Fihockey.org |date= |access-date=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202000007/http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nObstruction typically occurs in three circumstances&nbsp;\u2013 when a defender comes between the player with possession and the ball in order to prevent them tackling; when a defender's stick comes between the attacker's stick and the ball or makes contact with the attacker's stick or body; and also when blocking the opposition's attempt to tackle a teammate with the ball (called ''third party obstruction'').\n\nWhen the ball passes completely over the sidelines (on the sideline is still in), it is returned to play with a sideline hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. The ball must be placed on the sideline, with the hit taken from as near the place the ball went out of play as possible. If it crosses the back line after last touched by an attacker, a {{convert|15|m|yd|abbr=on}} hit is awarded. A 15&nbsp;m hit is also awarded for offences committed by the attacking side within 15&nbsp;m of the end of the pitch they are attacking.\n\n===Set plays===\nSet plays are often utilized for specific situations such as a penalty corner or free hit. For instance, many teams have penalty corner variations that they can use to beat the defensive team. The coach may have plays that sends the ball between two defenders and lets the player attack the opposing team's goal. There are no set plays unless your team has them.\n\n====Free hits====\nFree hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles (the term 'free hit' is standard usage but the ball need not be hit). The ball may be hit, pushed or lifted in any direction by the team offended against. The ball can be lifted from a free hit but not by hitting, you must flick or scoop to lift from a free hit. (In previous versions of the rules, hits in the area outside the circle in open play have been permitted but lifting one direction from a free hit was prohibited). Opponents must move {{convert|5|m|yd|abbr=on}}<!-- 5 m is the distance used in most of the world, only US high school rules mandate 7 yards. Please don't change--> from the ball when a free hit is awarded. A free hit must be taken from within playing distance of the place of the offence for which it was awarded and the ball must be stationary when the free hit is taken.\n\nAs mentioned above, a 15&nbsp;m hit is awarded if an attacking player commits a foul forward of that line, or if the ball passes over the back line off an attacker. These free hits are taken in-line with where the foul was committed (taking a line parallel with the sideline between where the offence was committed, or the ball went out of play). When an attacking free hit is awarded within 5&nbsp;m of the circle everyone including the person taking the penalty must be five metres from the circle and everyone apart from the person taking the free hit must be five metres away from the ball. When taking an attacking free hit, the ball may not be hit straight into the circle if you are within your attacking 23 meter area (25 yard area).  It must travel 5 meters before going in.\n\n====2009 experimental changes====\nIn February 2009 the FIH introduced, as a \"Mandatory Experiment\" for international competition, an updated version of the free-hit rule. The changes allows a player taking a free hit to pass the ball to themselves. Importantly, this is not a \"play on\" situation, but to the untrained eye it may appear to be. The player must play the ball any distance in two separate motions, before continuing as if it were a play-on situation. They may raise an aerial or overhead immediately as the second action, or any other stroke permitted by the rules of field hockey. At high-school level, this is called a self pass and was adopted in Pennsylvania in 2010 as a legal technique for putting the ball in play.\n\nAlso, all players (from both teams) must be at least 5&nbsp;m from any free hit awarded to the attack within the 23&nbsp;m area. The ball may not travel directly into the circle from a free hit to the attack within the 23 m area without first being touched by another player or being dribbled at least 5 m by a player making a \"self-pass\". These experimental rules apply to all free-hit situations, including sideline and corner hits. National associations may also choose to introduce these rules for their domestic competitions.\n\n====Attacking-free hit from quarter line====\nA free hit from the quarter line is awarded to the attacking team if the ball goes over the back-line after last being touched by a defender, provided they do not play it over the back-line deliberately, in which case a penalty corner is awarded. This free hit is played by the attacking team from a spot on the quarter line closest to where the ball went out of play. All the parameters of an attacking free hit within the attacking quarter of the playing surface apply.\n\n====Penalty corner====\nThe [[Penalty corner|short or penalty corner]] is awarded: [[File:Fieldhockey shortcorner defense.jpg|thumb|right|A group of five defenders, including the goalkeeper, prepare on the back line for a short corner.]]\n#  for an offence by a defender in the circle which does not prevent the probable scoring of a goal;\n#  for an intentional offence in the circle by a defender against an opponent who does not have possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball;\n#  for an intentional offence by a defender outside the circle but within the 23-metre area they are defending;\n#  for intentionally playing the ball over the back line by a defender;\n#  when the ball becomes lodged in a player's clothing or equipment while in the circle they are defending.\n\nShort corners begin with five defenders (usually including the keeper) positioned behind the back line and the ball placed at least 10 yards from the nearest goal post.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Field Hockey Rules|url=http://lower.usm.k12.wi.us/special/phy_ed/basic_fh_rules.htm|archivedate = 2014-07-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729122657/http://lower.usm.k12.wi.us/special/phy_ed/basic_fh_rules.htm }}</ref> All other players in the defending team must be beyond the centre line, that is not in their 'own' half of the pitch, until the ball is in play. Attacking players begin the play standing outside the scoring circle, except for one attacker who starts the corner by playing the ball from a mark 10&nbsp;m either side of the goal (the circle has a 14.63&nbsp;m radius). This player puts the ball into play by pushing or hitting the ball to the other attackers outside the circle; the ball must pass outside the circle and then put back into the circle before the attackers may make a shot at the goal from which a goal can be scored. FIH rules do not forbid a shot at goal before the ball leaves the circle after being 'inserted', nor is a shot at the goal from outside the circle prohibited, but a goal cannot be scored at all if the ball has not gone out of the circle and cannot be scored from a shot from outside the circle if it is not again played by an attacking player before it enters the goal.\n\nFor safety reasons, the first shot of a penalty corner must not exceed 460&nbsp;mm high (the height of the \"backboard\" of the goal) at the point it crosses the goal line if it is hit. However, if the ball is deemed to be below backboard height, the ball can be subsequently deflected above this height by another player (defender or attacker), providing that this deflection does not lead to danger. Note that the \"Slap\" stroke (a sweeping motion towards the ball, where the stick is kept on or close to the ground when striking the ball) is classed as a hit, and so the first shot at goal must be below backboard height for this type of shot also.\n\nIf the first shot at goal in a short corner situation is a push, flick or scoop, in particular the ''[[drag flick (field hockey)|drag flick]]'' (which has become popular at international and national league standards), the shot is permitted to rise above the height of the backboard, as long as the shot is not deemed dangerous to any opponent. This form of shooting was developed because it is not height restricted in the same way as the first hit shot at the goal and players with good technique are able to drag-flick with as much power as many others can hit a ball.\n\n====Penalty stroke====\n{{Main|Penalty stroke}}\nA [[penalty stroke]] is awarded when a defender commits a foul in the circle (accidental or otherwise) that prevents a probable goal or commits a deliberate foul in the circle or if defenders repeatedly run from the back line too early at a penalty corner. The penalty stroke is taken by a single attacker in the circle, against the goalkeeper, from a spot 6.4&nbsp;m from goal. The ball is played only once at goal by the attacker using a push, flick or scoop stroke. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with a 15 m hit to the defenders. When a goal is scored, play is restarted in the normal way.\n\n===Dangerous play and raised balls===\nAccording to the current Rules of Hockey 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202015-interactif.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rules of Hockey |website=Fih.ch |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment). The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch: it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous.\n\nThe velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball. A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalized, this is at the umpire's discretion. A jab tackle, for example, might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play. In the same way a high-velocity hit at very close range into an opponent, but below knee height, could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire, especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball.\n\nA ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason. A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground&nbsp;\u2013 a rule which is often only loosely applied; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance, 2\u20133&nbsp;m, and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it: these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire's perception of the skill of the players i.e. on the level of the game, in order to maintain game flow, which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do, by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so; this is also a matter at the umpire's discretion.\n\nThe term \"falling ball\" is important in what may be termed encroaching offences. It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height (although the height is not specified in rule) and is falling. So, for example, a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line (or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound.\n\nIn general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantaged by it or, obviously, not injured by it so that he cannot continue. A personal penalty, that is a caution or a suspension, rather than a team penalty, such as a free ball or a penalty corner, may be (many would say should be or even must be, but again this is at the umpire's discretion) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred, including dangerous play (but once advantage has been allowed the umpire cannot then call play back and award a team penalty).\n\nIt is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent's stick (or body on the ground), provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously. For example, a skillful attacker may lift the ball over a defenders stick or prone body and run past them, however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender's body, this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous.\n\nIt is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so, as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle. For example, two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time, would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so 'carrying' it would be penalised.\n\nDangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball, making a stroke at it (replacing what was at one time referred to as the \"sticks\" rule, which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play. This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent) or attempting to tackle, (fouls relating to tripping, impeding and obstruction). The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging, impeding and obstruction with the body, although these are also dealt with firmly, especially when these fouls are intentional: field hockey is a non-contact game.\n\nPlayers may not play or attempt to play at the ball above their shoulders unless trying to save a shot that could go into the goal, in which case they are permitted to stop the ball or deflect it safely away. A swing, as in a hit, at a high shot at the goal (or even wide of the goal) will probably be considered dangerous play if at opponents within 5&nbsp;m and such a stroke would be contrary to rule in these circumstances anyway.\n\nWithin the English National League it is now a legal action to take a ball above shoulder height if completed using a controlled action.\n\n===Warnings and suspensions===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"110\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"The penalty cards\">\nGr\u00fcne Karte Hockey.JPG|green card (warning with 2 min suspension)\nGelbe Karte Hockey.JPG|yellow card (suspension of 5 / 10 mins depending on intensity of foul)\nRote Karte Hockey.JPG|red card (permanent suspension)\n</gallery>\nHockey uses a three-tier [[penalty card]] system of warnings and suspensions:\n[[File:Indiana (80) (5028145116).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Penn State Nittany Lions field hockey|Penn State]] player receives a green card.]]\n*When shown a '''green card''', the player may have to leave the field for two minutes, depending on national regulations, though at international standards the player has to leave the field for two minutes, but any further infractions will result in a yellow or red card.\n*A '''yellow card''' is an official suspension similar to the [[penalty box]] in ice hockey. The duration is decided by the umpire issuing the card and the player must go to a pre-defined area of the pitch as chosen by the umpires, or by the local/state/national association of that country; in this case generally it will be in the rule book where that player must go to, at the beginning of the match. Most umpires will opt for a minimum of five minutes' duration without substitution; the maximum time is at the discretion of the umpire, depending on the seriousness of the offence; for example the second yellow to the same player or the first for danger might be given ten minutes. (In some modes, including indoor, shorter periods of suspension are applied, dependent on local rules.) However it is possible to send a player off for the remainder of the match if the penalty time is longer than the time remaining in the match.\nDepending on national rules, if a coach is sent off a player may have to leave the field too for the time the coach is sent off.\n\n*A '''red card''', just like in association football, is a permanent exclusion from the rest of the game, without substitution, and usually results in the player being banned for a certain period of time or number of matches (this is governed by local playing conditions, rather than the rules of field hockey). The player must also leave the pitch and surrounding area.\nIf a coach is sent off, depending on local rules, a player may have to leave the field for the remaining length of the match.\n\nIn addition to their colours, field hockey penalty cards are often shaped differently, so they can be recognized easily. Green cards are normally triangular, yellow cards rectangular and red cards circular.\n\nUnlike football, a player may receive more than one green or yellow card. However, they cannot receive the same card for the same offence (for example two yellows for dangerous play), and the second must always be a more serious card. In the case of a second yellow card for a different breach of the rules (for example a yellow for deliberate foot, and a second later in the game for dangerous play) the temporary suspension would be expected to be of considerably longer duration than the first. However, local playing conditions may mandate that cards are awarded only progressively, and not allow any second awards.\n\nUmpires, if the free hit would have been in the attacking 23&nbsp;m area, may upgrade the free hit to a penalty corner for dissent or other misconduct after the free hit has been awarded.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe teams' object is to play the ball into their attacking circle and, from there, hit, push or flick the ball into the goal, scoring a goal. The team with more goals after 60 minutes wins the game. The playing time may be shortened, particularly when younger players are involved, or for some tournament play. If the game is played in a countdown clock, like ice hockey, a goal can only count if the ball completely crosses the goaline and into the goal ''before'' time expires, not when the ball leaves the stick in the act of shooting.\n\n{{Main|Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)}}\nIn many competitions (such as regular club competition, or in pool games in FIH international tournaments such as the Olympics or the World Cup), a tied result stands and the overall competition standings are adjusted accordingly. Since March 2013, when tie breaking is required, the official FIH Tournament Regulations mandate to no longer have extra time and go directly into a [[Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)|penalty shoot-out]] when a classification match ends in a tie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/en/news-4281-executive-board-makes-key-decisions-at-latest|title=Executive Board makes key decisions at latest meeting|accessdate=2013-08-04|date=2013-03-21}}</ref> However, many associations follow the previous procedure consisting of two periods of 7.5 minutes of \"golden goal\" extra time during which the game ends as soon as one team scores.\n\n===Rule change procedure===\nThe FIH implemented a two-year rules cycle with the 2007\u201308 edition of the rules, with the intention that the rules be reviewed on a biennial basis. The 2009 rulebook was officially released in early March 2009 (effective 1 May 2009), however the FIH published the major changes in February. The current rule book is effective from 1 January 2017.\n\nThe FIH has adopted a policy of including major changes to the rules as \"Mandatory Experiments\", showing that they must be played at international level, but are treated as experimental and will be reviewed before the next rulebook is published and either changed, approved as permanent rules, or deleted.\n\n==Local rules==\nThere are sometimes minor variations in rules from competition to competition; for instance, the duration of matches is often varied for junior competitions or for carnivals. Different national associations also have slightly differing rules on player equipment.\n\nThe new [[Euro Hockey League]] and the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] has made major alterations to the rules to aid television viewers, such as splitting the game into four quarters, and to try to improve player behavior, such as a two-minute suspension for green cards\u2014the latter was also used in the 2010 World Cup and [[2016 Summer Olympic Games|2016 Olympics]]. In the [[United States]], the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] has its own rules for inter-collegiate competitions; high school associations similarly play to different rules, usually using the rules published by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS). This article assumes FIH rules unless otherwise stated. [[USA Field Hockey]] produces an annual summary of the differences.<ref name=\"US rule differences\">{{cite web |url=http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/48247/Rules_Comparisons_2011_v1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160208111233/http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/48247/Rules_Comparisons_2011_v1.0.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the games at the junior high level consist of four 12-minute periods, while the high-school level consists of four 15-minute periods. Many private American schools play 12-minute quarters, and some have adopted FIH rules rather than NFHS rules.\n\nPlayers are required to wear [[mouth guard]]s and shin guards in order to play the game. Also, there is a newer rule requiring certain types of sticks be used. In recent years, the NFHS rules have moved closer to FIH, but in 2011 a new rule requiring protective eyewear was introduced for the 2011 Fall season. Metal 'cage style' goggles favored by US high school lacrosse and permitted in high school field hockey is prohibited under FIH rules.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Field-Hockey/Features/2011/April/22/Approved-FIH-and-USA-Field-Hockey-protective-eyewear.aspx |title= Approved FIH and USA Field Hockey protective eyewear |publisher= USA Field Hockey |date= 22 April 2011 |accessdate= 19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n===Field hockey stick===\n{{main|Field hockey stick}}\n[[File:Splice Handle Head.jpg|thumb|Naming parts of stick]]\nEach player carries a \"stick\" that normally measures between 80\u201395&nbsp;cm (31\u201338\"); shorter or longer sticks are available. Sticks were traditionally made of wood, but are now often made also with [[fibreglass]], [[kevlar]] or [[carbon fibre]] [[composite material|composites]]. Metal is forbidden from use in field hockey sticks, due to the risk of injury from sharp edges if the stick were to break. The stick has a rounded handle, has a J-shaped hook at the bottom, and is flattened on the left side (when looking down the handle with the hook facing upwards). All sticks must be right-handed; left-handed ones are prohibited.\n\nThere was traditionally a slight curve (called the bow, or rake) from the top to bottom of the face side of the stick and another on the 'heel' edge to the top of the handle (usually made according to the angle at which the handle part was inserted into the splice of the head part of the stick), which assisted in the positioning of the stick head in relation to the ball and made striking the ball easier and more accurate.\n\nThe hook at the bottom of the stick was only recently the tight curve (Indian style) that we have nowadays. The older 'English' sticks had a longer bend, making it very hard to use the stick on the reverse. For this reason players now use the tight curved sticks.\n\nThe handle makes up about the top third of the stick. It is wrapped in a grip similar to that used on tennis racket. The grip may be made of a variety of materials, including [[chamois grip|chamois leather]], which many players think improves grip in the wet.\n\nIt was recently discovered that increasing the depth of the face bow made it easier to get high speeds from the dragflick and made the stroke easier to execute. At first, after this feature was introduced, the Hockey Rules Board placed a limit of 50&nbsp;mm on the maximum depth of bow over the length of the stick but experience quickly demonstrated this to be excessive. New rules now limit this curve to under 25&nbsp;mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked.\n\n===Field hockey ball===\n[[File:Balle de hockey sur gazon avec pi\u00e8ce de 5 francs.jpg|right|thumb|A field hockey ball with a 5 franc coin]]\nStandard field hockey balls are hard spherical balls, made of plastic (sometimes over a cork core), and are usually white, although they can be any colour as long as they contrast with the playing surface. The balls have a [[diameter]] of {{convert|71.3|-|74.8|mm|abbr=on}} and a [[mass]] of {{convert|156|-|163|g|abbr=on}}. The ball is often covered with [[Alcove (architecture)|indentations]] to reduce [[aquaplaning]] that can cause an inconsistent ball speed on wet surfaces.\n[[File:HockyBallsPuck.JPG|thumb|An assembly of field hockey balls and a roller hockey puck]]\n\n===Goalkeeping equipment===\n[[File:M060519 vit vipers-dragons 0071.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A goalkeeper makes a glove save. Equipment worn here is typical gear for a field hockey goalkeeper.]]\nThe 2007 rulebook has seen major changes regarding goalkeepers. A fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guards and kickers. Usually the field hockey [[goalkeepers]] must wear extensive additional protective equipment including chest guards, padded shorts, heavily padded hand protectors, groin protectors, neck guards, arm guards, and like all players, they must carry a stick. A goalie may not cross the 23&nbsp;m line, the sole exception to this being if the goalkeeper is to take a penalty stroke at the other end of the field, when the clock is stopped. The goalkeeper can also remove their helmet for this action. However, if the goalkeeper elects to wear only a helmet (and a different colored shirt), they may cross the 23&nbsp;m line if they have removed their helmet (and placed it safely off the field of play). If play returns to the circle without them having opportunity to replace the helmet, this player still has \"goalkeeping privileges\", that is, they are not limited to using their stick to play the ball whilst it is in the circle, and the helmet must be worn whilst defending penalty corners and penalty strokes but the best thing to do would be to wear it at all times. While goaltenders are allowed to use their feet and hands to clear the ball, they too are only allowed to use one side of their stick. Slide tackling is permitted as long as it is with the intention of clearing the ball, not aimed at a player.\n\nIt is now also even possible for teams to have a full eleven outfield players and no goalkeeper at all. No player may wear a helmet or other goalkeeping equipment, neither will any player be able to play the ball with any other part of the body than with their stick. This may be used to offer a tactical advantage, or to allow for play to commence if no goalkeeper or kit is available.\n\n==Tactics==\nThe basic tactic in field hockey, as in association football and many other team games, is to outnumber the opponent in a particular area of the field at a moment in time. When in possession of the ball this temporary numerical superiority can be used to pass the ball around opponents so that they cannot effect a tackle because they cannot get within playing reach of the ball and to further use this numerical advantage to gain time and create clear space for making scoring shots on the opponent's goal. When not in possession of the ball numerical superiority is used to isolate and channel an opponent in possession and 'mark out' any passing options so that an interception or a tackle may be made to gain possession. Highly skillful players can sometimes get the better of more than one opponent and retain the ball and successfully pass or shoot but this tends to use more energy than quick early passing.\n\nEvery player has a role depending on their relationship to the ball if the team communicates throughout the play of the game. There will be players on the ball (offensively - ball carriers; defensively - pressure, support players, and movement players.\n\nThe main methods by which the ball is moved around the field by players are a) passing b) pushing the ball and running with it controlled to the front or right of the body and c) \"dribbling\"; where the player controls the ball with the stick and moves in various directions with it to elude opponents. To make a pass the ball may be propelled with a pushing stroke, where the player uses their wrists to push the stick head through the ball while the stick head is in contact with it; the \"flick\" or \"scoop\", similar to the push but with an additional arm and leg and rotational actions to lift the ball off the ground; and the \"hit\", where a swing at ball is taken and contact with it is often made very forcefully, causing the ball to be propelled at velocities in excess of {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. In order to produce a powerful hit, usually for travel over long distances or shooting at the goal, the stick is raised higher and swung with maximum power at the ball, a stroke sometimes known as a \"drive\".\n\nTackles are made by placing the stick into the path of the ball or playing the stick head or shaft directly at the ball. To increase the effectiveness of the tackle, players will often place the entire stick close to the ground horizontally, thus representing a wider barrier. To avoid the tackle, the ball carrier will either pass the ball to a teammate using any of the push, flick, or hit strokes, or attempt to maneuver or \"drag\" the ball around the tackle, trying to deceive the tackler.\n\nIn recent years, the [[penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corner]] has gained importance as a goal scoring opportunity. Particularly with the technical development of the [[drag flick (field hockey)|drag flick]]. Tactics at penalty corners to set up time for a shot with a drag flick or a hit shot at the goal involve various complex plays, including multiple passes before deflections towards the goal is made but the most common method of shooting is the direct flick or hit at the goal.\n\nAt the highest level, field hockey is a fast moving, highly skilled game, with players using fast moves with the stick, quick accurate passing, and hard hits, in attempts to keep possession and move the ball towards the goal. Tackling with physical contact and otherwise physically obstructing players is not permitted. Some of the tactics used resemble football (soccer), but with greater ball speed.\n\nWith the 2009 changes to the rules regarding free hits in the attacking 23m area, the common tactic of hitting the ball hard into the circle was forbidden. Although at higher levels this was considered tactically risky and low-percentage at creating scoring opportunities, it was used with some effect to 'win' penalty corners by forcing the ball onto a defender's foot or to deflect high (and dangerously) off a defender's stick. The FIH felt it was a dangerous practice that could easily lead to raised deflections and injuries in the circle, which is often crowded at a free-hit situation, and outlawed it.\n\n==International competition==\n{{Main|International field hockey tournaments}}\nThe biggest two field hockey tournaments are the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] tournament, and the [[Hockey World Cup]], which is also held every 4 years. Apart from this, there is the [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] held each year for the six top-ranked teams. Field hockey has also been played at the [[Hockey at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] since 1998. Amongst the men, India lead in Olympic competition, having won 8 golds (6 successive in row). Amongst the women, Australia and Netherlands have 3 Olympic golds while Netherlands has clinched the World Cup 6 times. The [[Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament]] and [[Sultan of Johor Cup|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail Hockey Tournament]] for the junior team, both tournaments held annually in Malaysia, are becoming prominent field hockey tournaments where teams from around the world participate to win the cup.\n\n[[India men's national field hockey team|India]] and [[Pakistan men's national field hockey team|Pakistan]] dominated men's hockey until the early 1980s, winning eight Olympic golds and three of the first five world cups, respectively, but have become less prominent with the ascendancy of [[Netherlands men's national field hockey team|the Netherlands]], [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]], [[New Zealand men's national field hockey team|New Zealand]], [[Australia men's national field hockey team|Australia]], and [[Spain men's national field hockey team|Spain]] since the late 1980s, as grass playing surfaces were replaced with artificial turf (which conferred increased importance on athleticism). Other notable men's nations include [[Argentina men's national field hockey team|Argentina]], [[England men's national field hockey team|England]] (who combine with other British \"Home Nations\" to form the [[Great Britain men's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] side at [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic events]]) and [[South Korea men's national field hockey team|South Korea]]. Despite their recent drop in international rankings, Pakistan still holds the record of four World Cup wins.\n\n[[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]], [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]] and [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|Argentina]] are the most successful national teams among women. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] was the predominant women's team before field hockey was added to Olympic events. In the early 1990s, [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]] emerged as the strongest women's country although retirement of a number of players weakened the team. [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|Argentina]] improved its play on the 2000s, heading IFH rankings in 2003, 2010 and 2013. Other prominent women's teams are [[China women's national field hockey team|China]], [[South Korea women's national field hockey team|South Korea]], [[Germany women's national field hockey team|Germany]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]]. \n\n{{As of|November 2017}} Argentina's men's team and the Netherlands' women's teams lead the FIH world rankings.\n\nThis is a list of the major '''International field hockey tournaments''', in chronological order.  Tournaments included are:\n*[[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] - held every four years.\n*[[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] - held every four years, in between the Olympics.\n*[[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] - scrapped since 2018.\n*[[Hockey Champions Challenge|Champions Challenge]] - eventually replaced by now defunct World Hockey League.\n*[[Hockey Champions Challenge II|Champions Challenge II]] - eventually replaced by now defunct World Hockey League.\n\nAlthough invitational or not open to all countries, the following are also considered international tournaments:\n*[[Hockey at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] \u2013 held every four years between members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\n*[[Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament]] - held annually in Malaysia, an invitational tournament.\n*[[Sultan of Johor Cup|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail Hockey Tournament]] - held annually for athletes aged under-21 in Malaysia, an invitational tournament.\n\n==Variants==\n{{See also|Indoor field hockey|Bandy|Hockey 9s}}\n\n===Hockey 5s===\n\nAs the name suggests, Hockey 5s is a hockey variant which features five players on each team (which must include a goalkeeper). The field of play is 55&nbsp;m long and 41.70&nbsp;m wide&mdash; this is approximately half the size of a [[field hockey pitch|regular pitch]]. Few additional markings are needed as there is no penalty circle nor penalty corners; shots can be taken from anywhere on the pitch. Penalty strokes are replaced by a \"challenge\" which is like the one-on-one method used in a [[penalty shoot-out (field hockey)|penalty shoot-out]]. The duration of the match is three 12-minute periods with an interval of two minutes between periods. The rules are simpler and it is intended that the game is faster, creating more shots on goal with less play in midfield, and more attractive to spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/en/news-4306-it-s-here-hockey-5-set-to-make-official-debut|title=It's here!

The other three are discrete [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]], and their interactions are mediated by [[elementary particle]]s described by the [[Standard Model]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/standard-model/|title=The Standard Model of Particle Physics {{!}} symmetry magazine|website=www.symmetrymagazine.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> of [[particle physics]].\n\nWithin the Standard Model, the strong  interaction is carried by a particle called the gluon, and is responsible for the binding of [[quark]]s together to form [[hadron]]s, such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.  As a residual effect, it creates the [[nuclear force]] that binds the latter particles to form [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. The weak interaction is carried by particles called [[W and Z bosons]], and also acts on the nucleus of [[atom]]s, mediating [[radioactive decay]].  The electromagnetic force, carried by the [[photon]], creates [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, which are responsible for the attraction between orbital [[electron]]s and atomic nuclei which holds atoms together, as well as [[chemical bonding]] and [[electromagnetic wave]]s, including [[visible light]], and forms the basis for electrical technology. Although the electromagnetic force is far stronger than  gravity, it tends to cancel itself out within large objects, so over the largest distances (on the scale of planets and galaxies), gravity tends to be the dominant force.\n\nAll four fundamental forces are believed to be related, and to unite into a single force at high energies on a minuscule scale, the [[Planck scale]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-planck-scale|title=The Planck scale|work=symmetry magazine|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}</ref>, but [[particle accelerator]]s cannot produce the enormous energies required to experimentally probe this.  Efforts to devise a common theoretical framework that would explain the relation between the forces are perhaps the greatest goal of [[theoretical physicist]]s today.

Progress is currently being made in uniting the electroweak and strong fields within a [[Grand Unified Theory]] (GUT).  A bigger challenge is to find a way to [[Quantization (physics)|quantize]] the gravitational field, resulting in a theory of [[quantum gravity]] (QG) which would unite gravity in a common theoretical framework with the other three forces.  Some theories, notably [[string theory]], seek both QG and GUT within one framework, unifying all four fundamental interactions along with [[mass generation]] within a [[theory of everything]] (ToE).\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" class=\"wikitable floatcenter\"\n|+ '''The four fundamental interactions of nature'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~dfehling/particle.gif |title=Standard Model of Particles and Interactions |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=jhu.edu |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |access-date=August 18, 2016 |quote=.gif |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133522/https://www.pha.jhu.edu/~dfehling/particle.gif |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n! style=\"\" rowspan=\"2\" | Property/Interaction\n! style=\"background-color:#8080BF\" rowspan=\"2\" |Gravitation\n! style=\"background-color:#BFBF80\" |Weak\n! style=\"background-color:#BF8080\" |Electromagnetic\n! style=\"background-color:#80BF80\" colspan=\"2\" |Strong\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#BFA080\" colspan=\"2\" | <small>(Electroweak)</small>\n! style=\"background-color:#AAD4AA\" |<small>Fundamental</small>\n! style=\"background-color:#D5EAD5\" |<small>Residual</small>\n|-\n|Acts on:\n| align=\"center\" |Mass/Energy\n| align=\"center\" |[[Flavour (particle physics)|Flavor]]\n| align=\"center\" |Electric charge\n| align=\"center\" |[[Color charge]]\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|Bound states formed:\n| align=\"center\" |Planets, Stars, Solar systems, Galaxies\n| align=\"center\" |<small>n/a</small>\n| align=\"center\" |Atoms, Molecules\n| align=\"center\" |Hadrons\n| align=\"center\" |Atomic nuclei\n|-\n|Particles experiencing:\n| align=\"center\" |All particles\n| align=\"center\" |Left-handed [[fermions]]\n| align=\"center\" |Electrically charged\n| align=\"center\" |Quarks, [[Gluon]]s\n| align=\"center\" |[[Hadron]]s\n|-\n|Particles mediating:\n| align=\"center\" |<small>Not yet observed</small><br /><small>([[Graviton]] hypothesised)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |[[W and Z bosons|W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>\u2212</sup> and Z<sup>0</sup>]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[Photon|\u03b3]] (photon)\n| align=\"center\" |Gluons\n| align=\"center\" |[[Pion|\u03c0]], [[Rho meson|\u03c1]] and [[Omega meson|\u03c9]] [[meson]]s\n|-\n|Strength at the scale of quarks:\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-41}}<small>(predicted)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-4}}\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" |60\n| align=\"center\" |<small>Not applicable <br />to hadrons</small>\n|-\n|Strength at the scale of <br />protons/neutrons:\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-36}}<small>(predicted)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-7}}\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" |<small>Not applicable <br />to quarks</small>\n| align=\"center\" |20\n|}\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n==History==\n===Classical theory===\nIn his 1687 theory, [[Isaac Newton]] postulated space as an infinite and unalterable physical structure existing before, within, and around all objects while their states and relations unfold at a constant pace everywhere, thus [[absolute space and time]]. Inferring that all objects bearing mass approach at a constant rate, but collide by impact proportional to their masses, Newton inferred that matter exhibits an attractive force. His [[law of universal gravitation]] mathematically stated it to span the entire universe instantly (despite absolute time), or, if not actually a force, to be instant interaction among all objects (despite absolute space.) As conventionally interpreted, Newton's theory of motion modelled a ''[[central force]]'' without a communicating medium.<ref>Newton's absolute space was a medium, but not one transmitting gravitation.</ref> Thus Newton's theory violated the first principle of [[mechanical philosophy]], as stated by [[Descartes]], ''No [[action at a distance]]''. Conversely, during the 1820s, when explaining magnetism, [[Michael Faraday]] inferred a ''field'' filling space and transmitting that force. Faraday conjectured that ultimately, all forces unified into one.\n\nIn the early 1870s, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] unified electricity and magnetism as effects of an electromagnetic field whose third consequence was light, travelling at constant speed in a vacuum. The [[classical electrodynamics|electromagnetic field theory]] contradicted predictions of Newton's theory of motion, unless physical states of the [[luminiferous aether]]\u2014presumed to fill all space whether within matter or in a vacuum and to manifest the electromagnetic field\u2014aligned all phenomena and thereby held valid the [[Galilean relativity|Newtonian principle relativity or invariance]].\n\n===The Standard Model===\n{{Main article|Standard Model}} {{See also|Standard Model (mathematical formulation)}}\n[[Image:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|350px|The [[Standard Model]] of elementary particles, with the [[fermion]]s in the first three columns, the [[gauge boson]]s in the fourth column, and the [[Higgs boson]] in the fifth column]]\nThe Standard Model of particle physics was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century. In the Standard Model, the electromagnetic, strong, and weak interactions associate with [[elementary particles]], whose behaviours are modelled in [[quantum mechanics]] (QM). For predictive success with QM's [[Probability|probabilistic]] outcomes, [[particle physics]] conventionally models QM [[event (particle physics)|events]] across a field set to [[special theory of relativity|special relativity]], altogether relativistic quantum field theory (QFT).<ref>Meinard Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else \"Physicists debate whether the world is made of particles or fields\u2014or something else entirely\"], ''Scientific American'', 24 Jul 2013.</ref> Force particles, called [[gauge boson]]s\u2014''force carriers'' or ''[[messenger particles]]'' of underlying fields\u2014interact with matter particles, called [[fermion]]s. [[Baryonic matter|Everyday matter]] is atoms, composed of three fermion types: [[quark|up-quarks and down-quarks]] constituting, as well as electrons orbiting, the atom's nucleus. Atoms interact, form [[molecule]]s, and manifest further properties through electromagnetic interactions among their electrons absorbing and emitting photons, the electromagnetic field's force carrier, which if unimpeded traverse potentially infinite distance. Electromagnetism's QFT is [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\nThe electromagnetic interaction was modelled with the weak interaction, whose force carriers are [[W and Z bosons]], traversing the minuscule distance, in electroweak theory (EWT). Electroweak interaction would operate at such high temperatures as soon after the presumed [[Big Bang]], but, as the early universe cooled, [[symmetry breaking|split]] into electromagnetic and weak interactions. The strong interaction, whose force carrier is the [[gluon]], traversing minuscule distance among quarks, is modeled in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). EWT, QCD, and the [[Higgs mechanism]], whereby the [[Higgs field]] manifests [[Higgs boson]]s that interact with some quantum particles and thereby endow those particles with mass comprise [[particle physics]]' [[Standard Model]] (SM). Predictions are usually made using calculational approximation methods, although such [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is inadequate to model some experimental observations (for instance [[bound state]]s and [[soliton]]s.) Still, physicists widely accept the Standard Model as science's most experimentally confirmed theory.\n\n[[Beyond the Standard Model]], some theorists work to unite the electroweak and [[strong interaction|strong]] interactions within a [[Grand Unified Theory]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krauss|first=Lawrence M.|title=A Brief History of the Grand Unified Theory of Physics|url=http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/a-brief-history-of-the-grand-unified-theory-of-physics|journal=Nautilus}}</ref> (GUT). Some attempts at GUTs hypothesize \"shadow\" particles, such that every known [[fermion|matter particle]] associates with an undiscovered [[Gauge boson|force particle]], and vice versa, altogether [[supersymmetry]] (SUSY). Other theorists seek to quantize the gravitational field by the modelling behaviour of its hypothetical force carrier, the [[graviton]] and achieve quantum gravity (QG). One approach to QG is [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG). Still other theorists seek both QG and GUT within one framework, reducing all four fundamental interactions to a [[Theory of Everything]] (ToE). The most prevalent aim at a ToE is [[string theory]], although to model [[fermion|matter particles]], it added [[supersymmetry|SUSY]] to [[Gauge boson|force particles]]\u2014and so, strictly speaking, became [[superstring theory]]. Multiple, seemingly disparate superstring theories were unified on a backbone, [[M-theory]]. Theories beyond the Standard Model remain highly speculative, lacking great experimental support.\n\n==Overview of the fundamental interactions==\n[[Image:Particle overview.svg|thumb|400px|An overview of the various families of elementary and composite particles, and the theories describing their interactions. Fermions are on the left, and Bosons are on the right.]]\n\nIn the [[Model (abstract)|conceptual model]] of fundamental interactions, [[matter]] consists of [[fermion]]s, which carry [[Physical property|properties]] called [[charge (physics)|charge]]s and [[spin (physics)|spin]] \u00b1{{Frac|1|2}} (intrinsic [[angular momentum]] \u00b1{{frac|''\u0127''|2}}, where \u0127 is the [[reduced Planck constant]]). They attract or repel each other by exchanging [[boson]]s.\n\nThe interaction of any pair of fermions in perturbation theory can then be modelled thus:\n\n: Two fermions go in \u2192 ''interaction'' by boson exchange \u2192 Two changed fermions go out.\n\nThe exchange of bosons always carries [[energy]] and [[momentum]] between the fermions, thereby changing their speed and direction. The exchange may also transport a charge between the fermions, changing the charges of the fermions in the process (e.g., turn them from one type of fermion to another). Since bosons carry one unit of angular momentum, the fermion's spin direction will flip from +{{Frac|1|2}} to \u2212{{Frac|1|2}} (or vice versa) during such an exchange (in units of the [[reduced Planck's constant]]).\n\nBecause an interaction results in fermions attracting and repelling each other, an older term for \"interaction\" is [[force]].\n\nAccording to the present understanding, there are four fundamental interactions or forces: [[gravitation]], electromagnetism, the [[weak interaction]], and the strong interaction. Their magnitude and behaviour vary greatly, as described in the table below. Modern physics attempts to explain every observed [[natural phenomenon|physical phenomenon]] by these fundamental interactions. Moreover, reducing the number of different interaction types is seen as desirable. Two cases in point are the [[unified field theory|unification]] of:\n*[[Electric force|Electric]] and [[magnetic force]] into electromagnetism;\n*The [[electromagnetic interaction]] and the weak interaction into the electroweak interaction; see below.\n\nBoth magnitude (\"relative strength\") and \"range\", as given in the table, are meaningful only within a rather complex theoretical framework. It should also be noted that the table below lists properties of a conceptual scheme that is still the subject of ongoing research.\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Interaction !!

For example, photons mediate the interaction of [[electric charge]]s, and gluons mediate the interaction of [[color charge]]s.\n\n==The interactions==\n===Gravity===\n{{Main article|Gravity}}\n''Gravitation'' is by far the weakest of the four interactions at the atomic scale, where electromagnetic interactions dominate. But the idea that the weakness of gravity can easily be demonstrated by suspending a pin using a simple [[magnet]] (such as a refrigerator magnet) is fundamentally flawed. The only reason the magnet is able to hold the pin against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth is due to its relative proximity. There is clearly a short distance of separation between magnet and pin where a breaking point is reached, and due to the large mass of Earth this distance is disappointingly small.\n\nThus gravitation is very important for macroscopic objects and over macroscopic distances for the following reasons. Gravitation:\n*Is the only interaction that acts on all particles having mass, energy and/or momentum\n*Has an infinite range, like electromagnetism but unlike strong and weak interaction{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n*Cannot be absorbed, transformed, or shielded against\n*Always attracts and never repels (see function of geodesic equation in [[general relativity]])\n\nEven though electromagnetism is far stronger than gravitation, electrostatic attraction is not relevant for large celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies, simply because such bodies contain equal numbers of protons and electrons and so have a net electric charge of zero. Nothing \"cancels\" gravity, since it is only attractive, unlike electric forces which can be attractive or repulsive. On the other hand, all objects having mass are subject to the gravitational force, which only attracts. Therefore, only gravitation matters on the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe long range of gravitation makes it responsible for such large-scale phenomena as the structure of galaxies and [[black hole]]s and it retards the [[Universe#Big Bang model|expansion of the universe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Gravitation also explains astronomical phenomena on more modest scales, such as [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s, as well as everyday experience: objects fall; heavy objects act as if they were glued to the ground, and animals can only jump so high.\n\nGravitation was the first interaction to be described mathematically. In ancient times, [[Aristotle]] hypothesized that objects of different masses fall at different rates. During the [[Scientific Revolution]], [[Galileo Galilei]] experimentally determined that this hypothesis was wrong under certain circumstances \u2014 neglecting the friction due to air resistance, and buoyancy forces if an atmosphere is present (e.g. the case of a dropped air-filled balloon vs a water-filled balloon) all objects accelerate toward the Earth at the same rate. Isaac Newton's [[law of Universal Gravitation]] (1687) was a good approximation of the behaviour of gravitation. Our present-day understanding of gravitation stems from Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]] of 1915, a more accurate (especially for [[cosmology|cosmological]] masses and distances) description of gravitation in terms of the [[geometry]] of [[spacetime]].\n\nMerging general relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] (or [[quantum field theory]]) into a more general theory of [[quantum gravity]] is an area of active research. It is hypothesized that gravitation is mediated by a massless spin-2 particle called the [[graviton]].\n\nAlthough general relativity has been experimentally confirmed (at least for weak fields {{which|date=November 2015}}) on all but the smallest scales, there are rival theories of gravitation. Those taken seriously by{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} the physics community all reduce to general relativity in some limit, and the focus of observational work is to establish limitations on what deviations from general relativity are possible.\n\nProposed [[extra dimensions]] could explain why the gravity force is so weak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/extra-dimensions-gravitons-and-tiny-black-holes|title=Extra dimensions, gravitons, and tiny black holes|date=20 January 2012|author=CERN}}</ref>\n\n===Electroweak interaction===\n{{Main article|Electroweak interaction}}\n[[Electromagnetism]] and weak interaction appear to be very different at everyday low energies. They can be modelled using two different theories. However, above unification energy, on the order of 100 [[GeV]], they would merge into a single electroweak force.\n\nElectroweak theory is very important for modern [[cosmology]], particularly on how the [[universe]] evolved. This is because shortly after the Big Bang, the temperature was approximately above 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], the electromagnetic force and the weak force were merged into a combined electroweak force.\n\nFor contributions to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction between [[particle physics|elementary particles]], Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1979.<ref>{{Citation|first=Sander |last=Bais |year=2005| title=The Equations. Icons of knowledge| isbn=0-674-01967-9}} p.84</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref>\n\n====Electromagnetism====\n{{Main article|Electromagnetism}}\nElectromagnetism is the force that acts between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles. This phenomenon includes the [[electrostatic force]] acting between charged particles at rest, and the combined effect of electric and [[Magnetism|magnetic]] forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other.\n\nElectromagnetism has infinite range  like gravity, but is vastly stronger, and therefore describes a number of macroscopic phenomena of everyday experience such as [[friction]], [[rainbows]], [[lightning]], and all human-made devices using [[electric current]], such as television, [[laser]]s, and [[computer]]s. Electromagnetism fundamentally determines all macroscopic, and many atomic levels, properties of the [[chemical element]]s, including all [[chemical bond]]ing.\n\nIn a four kilogram (~1 gallon) jug of water there are\n\n<center><math> 4000 \\ \\mbox{g}\\,H_2 O \\cdot \\frac{1 \\ \\mbox{mol}\\,H_2 O}{18 \\ \\mbox{g}\\,H_2 O} \\cdot \\frac{10 \\ \\mbox{mol}\\,e^{-}}{1 \\ \\mbox{mol}\\,H_2 O} \\cdot \\frac{96,000 \\ \\mbox{C}\\,}{1 \\ \\mbox{mol}\\,e^{-}} = 2.1 \\times 10^{8} C \\ \\, \\ </math></center>\n\nof total electron charge. Thus, if we place two such jugs a meter apart, the electrons in one of the jugs repel those in the other jug with a force of\n\n<center><math> {1 \\over 4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\frac{(2.1 \\times 10^{8} C)^2}{(1 m)^2} = 4.1 \\times 10^{26} N.</math></center>\n\nThis force is larger than the planet Earth would weigh if weighed on another Earth. The [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] in one jug also repel those in the other with the same force. However, these repulsive forces are canceled by the attraction of the electrons in jug A with the nuclei in jug B and the attraction of the nuclei in jug A with the electrons in jug B, resulting in no net force. Electromagnetic forces are tremendously stronger than gravity but cancel out so that for large bodies gravity dominates.\n\nElectrical and magnetic phenomena have been observed since ancient times, but it was only in the 19th century [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered that electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same fundamental interaction. By 1864, [[Maxwell's equations]] had rigorously quantified this unified interaction. Maxwell's theory, restated using [[vector calculus]], is the classical theory of electromagnetism, suitable for most technological purposes.\n\nThe constant speed of light in a vacuum (customarily described with a lowercase letter \"c\") can be derived from Maxwell's equations, which are consistent with the theory of special relativity. [[Einstein]]'s 1905 theory of [[special relativity]], however, which flows from the observation that the [[speed of light]] is constant no matter how fast the observer is moving, showed that the theoretical result implied by Maxwell's equations has profound implications far beyond electromagnetism on the very nature of time and space.\n\nIn another work that departed from classical electro-magnetism, Einstein also explained the [[photoelectric effect]] by hypothesizing that light was transmitted in [[quantum|quanta]], which we now call [[photon]]s. Starting around 1927, [[Paul Dirac]] combined [[quantum mechanics]] with the relativistic theory of [[electromagnetism]]. Further work in the 1940s, by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], completed this theory, which is now called [[quantum electrodynamics]], the revised theory of electromagnetism. Quantum electrodynamics and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical basis for electromagnetic behavior such as [[quantum tunneling]], in which a certain percentage of electrically charged particles move in ways that would be impossible under the classical electromagnetic theory, that is necessary for everyday electronic devices such as [[transistors]] to function.\n\n====Weak interaction====\n{{Main article|Weak interaction}}\nThe ''weak interaction'' or ''weak nuclear force'' is responsible for some nuclear phenomena such as [[beta decay]]. Electromagnetism and the weak force are now understood to be two aspects of a unified [[electroweak interaction]] \u2014 this discovery was the first step toward the unified theory known as the [[Standard Model]]. In the theory of the electroweak interaction, the carriers of the weak force are the massive [[gauge boson]]s called the [[W and Z bosons]]. The weak interaction is the only known interaction which does not conserve [[parity (physics)|parity]]; it is left-right asymmetric. The weak interaction even [[CP-violation|violates CP symmetry]] but does [[CPT symmetry|conserve CPT]].\n\n===Strong interaction===\n{{Main article|Strong interaction}}\nThe ''strong interaction'', or ''strong nuclear force'', is the most complicated interaction, mainly because of the way it varies with distance. At distances greater than 10 [[femtometers]], the strong force is practically unobservable. Moreover, it holds only inside the atomic nucleus.\n\nAfter the nucleus was discovered in 1908, it was clear that a new force, today known as the nuclear force, was needed to overcome the [[Electrostatics|electrostatic repulsion]], a manifestation of electromagnetism, of the positively charged protons. Otherwise, the nucleus could not exist. Moreover, the force had to be strong enough to squeeze the protons into a volume whose diameter is about 10<sup>\u221215</sup> [[metre|m]], much smaller than that of the entire atom. From the short range of this force, [[Hideki Yukawa]] predicted that it was associated with a massive particle, whose mass is approximately 100 MeV.\n\nThe 1947 discovery of the [[pion]] ushered in the modern era of particle physics. Hundreds of hadrons were discovered from the 1940s to 1960s, and an [[Regge theory|extremely complicated theory]] of hadrons as strongly interacting particles was developed. Most notably:\n*The pions were understood to be oscillations of [[Vacuum expectation value|vacuum condensates]];\n*[[Jun John Sakurai]] proposed the rho and omega [[vector boson]]s to be [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|force carrying particles]] for approximate symmetries of [[isospin]] and [[hypercharge]];\n*[[Geoffrey Chew]], Edward K. Burdett and [[Steven Frautschi]] grouped the heavier hadrons into families that could be understood as vibrational and rotational excitations of [[string theory|strings]].\n\nWhile each of these approaches offered deep insights, no approach led directly to a fundamental theory.\n\n[[Murray Gell-Mann]] along with [[George Zweig]] first proposed fractionally charged quarks in 1961. Throughout the 1960s, different authors considered theories similar to the modern fundamental theory of [[quantum chromodynamics|quantum chromodynamics (QCD)]] as simple models for the interactions of quarks. The first to hypothesize the gluons of QCD were [[Moo-Young Han]] and [[Yoichiro Nambu]], who introduced the [[quark color]] charge and hypothesized that it might be associated with a force-carrying field. At that time, however, it was difficult to see how such a model could permanently confine quarks. Han and Nambu also assigned each quark color an integer electrical charge, so that the quarks were fractionally charged only on average, and they did not expect the quarks in their model to be permanently confined.\n\nIn 1971, Murray Gell-Mann and [[Harald Fritzsch]] proposed that the Han/Nambu color gauge field was the correct theory of the short-distance interactions of fractionally charged quarks. A little later, [[David Gross]], [[Frank Wilczek]], and [[David Politzer]] discovered that this theory had the property of [[asymptotic freedom]], allowing them to make contact with [[deep inelastic scattering|experimental evidence]]. They concluded that QCD was the complete theory of the strong interactions, correct at all distance scales. The discovery of asymptotic freedom led most physicists to accept QCD since it became clear that even the long-distance properties of the strong interactions could be consistent with experiment if the quarks are permanently confined.\n\nAssuming that quarks are confined, [[Mikhail Shifman]], [[Arkady Vainshtein]] and [[Valentine Zakharov]] were able to compute the properties of many low-lying hadrons directly from QCD, with only a few extra parameters to describe the vacuum. In 1980, [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] published computer calculations based on the first principles of QCD, establishing, to a level of confidence tantamount to certainty, that QCD will confine quarks. Since then, QCD has been the established theory of the strong interactions.\n\nQCD is a theory of fractionally charged quarks interacting by means of 8 bosonic particles called gluons. The gluons interact with each other, not just with the quarks, and at long distances the lines of force collimate into strings. In this way, the mathematical theory of QCD not only explains how quarks interact over short distances but also the string-like behavior, discovered by Chew and Frautschi, which they manifest over longer distances.\n\n===Beyond the Standard Model===\n{{main article|Physics beyond the Standard Model}}\n{{See also|Elementary particle#Beyond the Standard Model}}\nNumerous theoretical efforts have been made to systematize the existing four fundamental interactions on the model of electroweak unification.\n\nGrand Unified Theories (GUTs) are proposals to show that the three fundamental interactions described by the Standard Model are all different manifestations of a single interaction with [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] that break down and create separate interactions below some extremely high level of energy. GUTs are also expected to predict some of the relationships between constants of nature that the Standard Model treats as unrelated, as well as predicting [[gauge coupling unification]] for the relative strengths of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (this was, for example, verified at the [[Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider]] in 1991 for [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|supersymmetric]] theories).{{Specify}}\n\nTheories of everything, which integrate GUTs with a quantum gravity theory face a greater barrier, because no quantum gravity theories, which include [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], and [[twistor theory]], have secured wide acceptance. Some theories look for a graviton to complete the Standard Model list of force-carrying particles, while others, like loop quantum gravity, emphasize the possibility that time-space itself may have a quantum aspect to it.\n\nSome theories beyond the Standard Model include a hypothetical [[fifth force]], and the search for such a force is an ongoing line of experimental research in physics. In [[supersymmetric]] theories, there are particles that acquire their masses only through supersymmetry breaking effects and these particles, known as [[Moduli (physics)|moduli]] can mediate new forces. Another reason to look for new forces is the discovery that the [[expansion of the universe]] is accelerating (also known as [[dark energy]]), giving rise to a need to explain a nonzero [[cosmological constant]], and possibly to other modifications of [[general relativity]]. Fifth forces have also been suggested to explain phenomena such as [[Charge parity|CP]] violations, [[dark matter]], and [[dark flow]].\n\nIn December 2015, two observations in the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] hinted at the existence of a new particle six times heavier than the [[Higgs boson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3675893/Is-Large-Hadron-Collider-set-reveal-secrets-universe-Dark-matter-breakthrough-fifth-fundamental-force-finally-revealed-researchers-prepare-publish-latest-findings.html|title=Is the Large Hadron Collider set to reveal secrets of the universe?|access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> However, after obtaining more experimental data, the anomaly appeared to not be significant.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Gibney |title=Hopes for revolutionary new LHC particle dashed |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=August 5, 2016 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/hopes-for-revolutionary-new-lhc-particle-dashed-1.20376 |accessdate=August 18, 2016|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20376|bibcode=2016Natur.536..133G}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n*[[Quintessence (physics)|Quintessence]], a hypothesized fifth force.\n*''People'': [[Gerardus 't Hooft]], [[Edward Witten]], [[Howard Georgi]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n====General====\n*{{Citation|author-link=Paul Davies|first=Paul |last=Davies|year=1986|title=The Forces of Nature|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

By 1978 there were more than 10 manufacturers producing such FDDs.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last=Watson |title=The Floppy Disk |journal=[[Canadian Business]] |date=2010-05-24 |volume=83 |issue=8 |page=17}}</ref> There were competing [[floppy disk format]]s, with hard- and soft-sector versions and encoding schemes such as [[Differential Manchester encoding|FM]], [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]], [[M\u00b2FM]] and [[Group coded recording|GCR]]. The {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch format displaced the 8-inch one for most applications, and the hard-sectored disk format disappeared. The most common capacity of the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360&nbsp;KB. In 1984 IBM introduced with its PC-AT model the 1.2 MB dual-sided floppy disk, but it never became very popular. IBM started using the 720&nbsp;KB [[Double density|double-density]] {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch microfloppy disk on its [[IBM PC Convertible|Convertible]] laptop computer in 1986 and the 1.44&nbsp;MB [[High-density storage media|high-density]] version with the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] line in 1987. These disk drives could be added to older PC models. In 1988 IBM introduced a drive for 2.88&nbsp;MB \"DSED\" diskettes in its top-of-the-line PS/2 models, but this was a commercial failure.\n\nThroughout the early 1980s, limitations of the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch format became clear.

The large market share of the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch format made it difficult for these new formats to gain significant market share.<ref name=\"Jarrett\"/> A variant on the Sony design, introduced in 1982 by a large number of manufacturers, was then rapidly adopted; by 1988 the {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch was outselling the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch.<ref>1991 Disk/Trend Report, Flexible Disk Drives, Figure 2</ref>\n\nGenerally the term floppy disk persisted,{{efn|However, called \"stiffy\" in South Africa}} even though later style floppy disks have a hard case around an internal floppy disk.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch disks had been superseded by {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disks. During this time, PCs frequently came equipped with drives of both sizes. By the mid-1990s, {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch drives had virtually disappeared, as the {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk became the predominant floppy disk. The advantages of the {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk were its higher capacity, its smaller size, and its rigid case which provided better protection from dirt and other environmental risks. However, largely due to its simpler construction (with no metal parts) the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch disk [[unit price]] was lower throughout its history, usually in the range of a third to a half that of a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Prevalence===\n[[File:Usb floppy drive.jpg|thumb|left|Imation USB floppy drive, model 01946: an external drive that accepts high-density disks]]Floppy disks became commonplace during the 1980s and 1990s in their use with [[personal computer]]s to distribute software, transfer data, and create [[backup]]s. Before hard disks became affordable to the general population,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Costs\"/> floppy disks were often used to store a computer's [[operating system]] (OS). Most home computers from that period have an elementary OS and [[BASIC]] stored in [[read-only memory|ROM]], with the option of loading a more advanced [[operating system]] from a floppy disk.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the increasing software size meant large packages like [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Adobe Photoshop]] required a dozen disks or more. In 1996, there were an estimated five billion standard floppy disks in use.<ref name=\"businessweek\">{{cite journal |author-last=Reinhardt |author-first=Andy |date=1996-08-12 |title=Iomega's zip drives need a bit more zip |journal=[[Business Week]] |publisher=[[The McGraw-Hill Companies]] |issue=33 |issn=0007-7135 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/33/b3488114.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706151833/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/33/b3488114.htm |archive-date=2008-07-06}}</ref> Then, distribution of larger packages was gradually replaced by [[CD-ROM]]s, [[DVD]]s and online distribution.\n\nAn attempt to enhance the existing {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch designs was the [[SuperDisk]] in the late 1990s, utilizing very narrow data tracks and a high precision head guidance mechanism with a capacity of 120 [[megabyte|MB]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/floppy8.html |title=floppy |publisher=LinuxCommand.org |date=2006-01-04 |access-date=2011-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034443/http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/floppy8.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}</ref> and backward-compatibility with standard {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppies; a [[format war]] briefly occurred between SuperDisk and other high-density floppy-disk products, although ultimately recordable CDs/DVDs, solid-state flash storage, and eventually online storage would render all these removable disk formats obsolete. External [[USB]]-based floppy disk drives are still available, and many modern systems provide firmware support for booting from such drives.\n\n===Gradual transition to other formats===\n[[File:Disk-cleaning-kit-front-and-rear.jpg|thumb|Front and rear of a retail {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch and {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch floppy disk cleaning kit, as sold in Australia at retailer Big W, circa early 1990s]]\nIn the mid 1990s, mechanically incompatible higher-density floppy disks were introduced, like the [[Zip drive|Iomega Zip disk]]. Adoption was limited by the competition between proprietary formats and the need to buy expensive drives for computers where the disks would be used. In some cases, failure in market penetration was exacerbated by the release of higher-capacity versions of the drive and media being not [[backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with the original drives, dividing the users between new and old adopters. Consumers were wary of making costly investments into unproven and rapidly changing technologies, so none of the technologies became the established standard.\n\nApple introduced the [[iMac]] in 1998 with a CD-ROM drive but no floppy drive; this made USB-connected floppy drives popular accessories, as the iMac came without any writable removable media device.\n\n[[CD-R|Recordable CDs]] were touted as an alternative, because of the greater capacity, compatibility with existing CD-ROM drives, and\u2014with the advent of [[CD-RW|re-writeable CD]]s and packet writing\u2014a similar reusability as floppy disks.\nHowever, CD-R/RWs remained mostly an archival medium, not a medium for exchanging data or editing files on the medium itself, because there was no common standard for packet writing, which allowed for small updates.\nOther formats, such as [[Magneto-optical drive|Magneto-optical discs]], had the flexibility of floppy disks combined with greater capacity but remained niche due to costs.\nHigh-capacity backward compatible floppy technologies became popular for a while and were sold as an option or even included in standard PCs, but in the long run, their use was limited to professionals and enthusiasts.\n\nFlash-based USB-thumb drives finally were a practical and popular replacement, that supported traditional file systems and all common usage scenarios of floppy disks. As opposed to other solutions, no new drive type or special software was required that impeded adoption, since all that was necessary was an already common [[USB]]-port.\n\n[[File:Different types of storage components.jpg|thumb|Different data storage media]]\n\n===Use in the early 21st century===\n[[File:Floppy hardware emulator.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Floppy disk hardware emulator|floppy hardware emulator]], same size as a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch drive, provides a USB interface to the user]]By 2002, most manufacturers still provided floppy disk drives as standard equipment to meet user demand for [[Sneakernet|file-transfer]] and an emergency boot device, as well as for the general secure feeling of having the familiar device.<ref>{{cite web |author-last=Spring |author-first=Tom |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/103037/what_has_your_floppy_drive_done_for_you_lately.html |title=What Has Your Floppy Drive Done for You Lately?

Subsequently, enabled by the widespread support for USB flash drives and BIOS boot, manufacturers and retailers progressively reduced the availability of floppy disk drives as standard equipment. In February 2003, [[Dell]], a leading computer company at the time, announced that floppy drives would no longer be pre-installed on [[Dell Dimension]] home computers, although they were still available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] add-on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2905953.stm |title=R.I.P.

If BIOS updates fail or become corrupt, floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery. The music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks (e.g. synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, sequencers, and [[lighting control console|lighting consoles]]). Industrial automation equipment such as programmable [[Machine industry|machinery]] and [[industrial robot]]s may not have a USB interface; data and programs are then loaded from disks, damageable in industrial environments. This equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability; existing software emulation and [[virtualization]] do not solve this problem because a customized operating system is used that has no [[device driver|drivers]] for USB devices. [[Floppy disk hardware emulator|Hardware floppy disk emulators]] can be made to interface [[floppy-disk controller]]s to a USB port that can be used for flash drives.\n\nIn May 2016, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] released a report that covered the need to upgrade or replace legacy computer systems within federal agencies. According to this document, old [[IBM Series/1]] minicomputers running on [[Floppy disk#8.0|8-inch floppy disk]]s are still [[nuclear command and control|used to coordinate]] \"the operational functions of the United States' nuclear forces\".

Unlike hard disks, floppy disks are handled and seen; even a novice user can identify a floppy disk. Because of these factors, a picture of a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disk has become an [[interface metaphor]] for saving data.

The medium is contained in a square plastic cover that has a small oblong opening in both sides to allow the drive's heads to read and write data and a large hole in the center to allow the magnetic medium to spin by rotating it from its middle hole.\n\nInside the cover are two layers of fabric with the magnetic medium sandwiched in the middle. The fabric is designed to reduce friction between the medium and the outer cover, and catch particles of debris abraded off the disk to keep them from accumulating on the heads. The cover is usually a one-part sheet, double-folded with flaps glued or spot-welded together.\n\nA small notch disk identifies that it is writable, detected by a mechanical switch or [[phototransistor]] above it; if it is not present, the disk can be written; in the 8-inch disk the notch is covered to enable writing while in the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch disk the notch is open to enable writing. Tape may be used over the notch to change the mode of the disk.  Punch devices were sold to convert read-only disks to writable ones and enable writing on the unused side of single sided disks; such modified disks became known as [[flippy disk]]s.\n\nAnother LED/photo-transistor pair located near the center of the disk detects the ''index hole'' once per rotation in the magnetic disk; it is used to detect the angular start of each track  and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed. Early 8\u2011inch and {{frac|5|1|4}}\u2011inch disks had physical holes for each sector and were termed ''[[hard sectoring|hard sectored]]'' disks. Later ''soft-[[Disk sector|sectored]]'' disks have only one index hole, and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low-level software from patterns marking the start of a sector. Generally, the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks, with only the disks and controllers differing. Some operating systems utilizing soft sectors, such as [[Apple DOS]], do not use the index hole; the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor; this was mainly a hardware cost-saving measure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apple2history.org/history/ah05/ |title=The Disk II |website=Apple II History |access-date=2018-02-17 |quote=Wozniak\u2019s technique would allow the drive to do self-synchronization (\u201csoft sectoring\u201d), not have to deal with that little timing hole, and save on hardware.}}</ref>\n\n===={{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk====\nThe core of the 3\u00bd-inch disk is the same as the other two disks, but the front has only a label and a small opening for reading and writing data, protected by the shutter\u2014a spring-loaded metal or plastic cover, pushed to the side on entry into the drive.

A notch at top right ensures that the disk is in the correct orientation and an arrow at top left indicates direction of insertion.

In [[IBM PC compatible]]s, Commodores, Apple II/IIIs, and other non-Apple-Macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives, a disk may be ejected manually at any time. The drive has a disk-change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted. Failure of this mechanical switch is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive (and hence the operating system) fails to notice.\n\nOne of the chief [[usability]] problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability; even inside a closed plastic housing, the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust, condensation and temperature extremes. As with all [[magnetic storage]], it is vulnerable to magnetic fields. Blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings, cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions. Rough treatment or removing the disk from the drive while the magnetic media is still spinning is likely to cause damage to the disk, drive head, or stored data. On the other hand, the 3\u00bd\u2011inch floppy has been lauded for its mechanical usability by [[Human-Computer Interaction]] expert [[Donald Norman]]:<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Donald Norman |author-first=Donald |author-last=Norman |title=[[The Design of Everyday Things]] |chapter=Chapter 1 |date=1990 |isbn=0-385-26774-6 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=New York, USA}}</ref>\n\n{{quote\n| \"A simple example of a good design is the 3\u00bd-inch magnetic diskette for computers, a small circle of floppy magnetic material encased in hard plastic. Earlier types of floppy disks did not have this plastic case, which protects the magnetic material from abuse and damage. A sliding metal cover protects the delicate magnetic surface when the diskette is not in use and automatically opens when the diskette is inserted into the computer. The diskette has a square shape: there are apparently eight possible ways to insert it into the machine, only one of which is correct. What happens if I do it wrong? I try inserting the disk sideways. Ah, the designer thought of that. A little study shows that the case really isn't square: it's rectangular, so you can't insert a longer side. I try backward. The diskette goes in only part of the way. Small protrusions, indentations, and cutouts, prevent the diskette from being inserted backward or upside down: of the eight ways one might try to insert the diskette, only one is correct, and only that one will fit. An excellent design.\"\n}}\n\n[[File:Floppy drive spindle motor open.jpg|thumb|left|The spindle motor from a {{frac|3|1|2}}\u2011inch unit]]\n[[File:Citizen W1D-9364 - read write head-4005.jpg|thumb|A [[disk read-and-write head|read-write head]] from a {{frac|3|1|2}}\u2011inch unit]]\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Lecteur de disquette 2.jpg|thumb|How the read-write head is applied on the floppy]]\n[[File:Visualization of magnetic information on a Floppy Disk (CMOS-MagView).jpg|thumb|left|Visualization of magnetic information on floppy disk (image recorded with CMOS-MagView)]]A spindle motor in the drive rotates the magnetic medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write heads radially along the surface of the disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/Oral_History/102657926.05.01.acc.pdf |title=Oral History Panel on 8 inch Floppy Disk Drives |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Porter |date=2005 |page=4 |format=PDF |access-date=2011-06-22 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707221048/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/Oral_History/102657926.05.01.acc.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-07}}</ref> Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated ({{frac|5|1|4}}\") or disk insertion was complete (3\u00bd\"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the [[floppy disk controller]], which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.\n\nA blank unformatted diskette has a coating of magnetic oxide with no magnetic order to the particles. During formatting, the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks, each broken up into [[disk sector|sectors]], enabling the controller to properly read and write data. The tracks are concentric rings around the center, with spaces between tracks where no data is written; gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors and at the end of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive, and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems. Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk. A [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) is written into the sector headers and at the end of the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors. Some errors are [[soft error|soft]] and can be resolved by automatically re-trying the read operation; other errors are permanent and the disk controller will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail.\n\nAfter a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at the front of the drive is manually lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch drives and all 3\u00bd-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On [[Apple Macintosh]] computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened [[paper clip]] into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a [[CD-ROM]] drive in a similar situation.\n\nBefore a disk can be accessed, the drive needs to synchronize its head position with the disk tracks. In some drives, this is accomplished with a Track Zero Sensor, while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile reference surface. In either case, the head is moved so that it is approaching track zero position of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned. For a drive without the sensor, the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero.\n\nSome drive mechanisms such as the Apple II {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch drive without a track zero sensor, produce characteristic mechanical noises when trying to move the heads past the reference surface. This physical striking is responsible for the {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch drive clicking during the boot of an Apple II, and the loud rattles of its DOS and ProDOS when disk errors occurred and track zero synchronization was attempted.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{main|Floppy disk format|List of floppy disk formats}}\n\nDifferent sizes of floppy disks are mechanically incompatible, and disks can fit only one size of drive. Drive assemblies with both 3\u00bd-inch and {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch slots were available during the transition period between the sizes, but they contained two separate drive mechanisms. In addition, there are many subtle, usually software-driven incompatibilities between the two. {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch disks formatted for use with Apple II computers would be unreadable and treated as unformatted on a Commodore. As [[computer platforms]] began to form, attempts were made at interchangeability. For example, the \"[[SuperDrive]]\" included from the [[Macintosh SE]] to the [[Power Macintosh G3]] could read, write and format IBM PC format 3\u00bd-inch disks, but few IBM-compatible computers had drives that did the reverse. 8-inch, {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch and 3\u00bd-inch drives were manufactured in a variety of sizes, most to fit standardized [[drive bay]]s. Alongside the common disk sizes were [[floppy disk variants|non-classical sizes]] for specialized systems.\n\n==={{anchor|8.0}}8-inch floppy disk===\n[[File:8-inch floppy disk - IZOT, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|upright|8-inch floppy disk]]\n\nThe first floppy disk was 8 inches in diameter,<ref name=\"Teja_1985\">{{cite book |title=The Designer's Guide to Disk Drives |author-first=Edward R. |author-last=Teja |publisher=[[Reston Publishing Company, Inc.]] / [[Prentice-Hall Company]] |location=Reston, Virginia, USA |edition=1st |date=1985 |isbn=0-8359-1268-X}}</ref> was protected by a flexible plastic jacket and was a read-only device used by IBM as a way of loading microcode.<ref>{{cite web |title=Floppy Disk |url=http://grok.lsu.edu/Article.aspx?articleid=11150 |publisher=[[Louisiana State University]]}}</ref> Read/write floppy disks and their drives became available in 1972 but it was IBM's 1973 introduction of the [[IBM 3740|3740 data entry system]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/rochester/rochester_4016.html|title=IBM Archives: IBM 3740|date=23 January 2003|website=www-03.ibm.com}}</ref> that began the establishment of floppy disks, called by IBM the \"'''Diskette 1'''\", as an industry standard for information interchange.  Early [[microcomputer]]s used for engineering, business, or word processing often used one or more 8-inch disk drives for removable storage; the [[CP/M]] operating system was developed for microcomputers with 8-inch drives.\n\nThe family of 8-inch disks and drives increased over time and later versions could store up to 1.2 MB;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpm.z80.de/manuals/IBM_GA21_9182_4.txt|title=The IBM Diskette General Information Manual|publisher=}}</ref> many microcomputer applications did not need that much capacity on one disk, so a smaller size disk with lower-cost media and drives was feasible. The {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch drive succeeded the 8-inch size in many applications, and developed to about the same storage capacity as the original 8-inch size, using higher-density media and recording techniques.\n\n==={{anchor|5.25|5.25-inch floppy disk}}{{frac|5|1|4}}-inch floppy disk===\n{{multiple image\n|image1=5.25 inch floppy disk, front and back.jpg|width1=250\n|caption1={{frac|5|1|4}}\" floppies, front and back\n|image2=5.25 in. floppy disk drive top.jpg|width2=150\n|caption2=Uncovered {{frac|5|1|4}}\u2011inch disk mechanism with disk inserted.\n}}\nThe head gap of an 80\u2011track high-density (1.2 MB in the [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] format) {{frac|5|1|4}}\u2011inch drive (a.k.a.

Disks written on a 40\u2011track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become unreadable on any 40\u2011track drives due to track width incompatibility.\n\nSingle sided disks were coated on both sides, despite the availability of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free on both sides of the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over ([[flippy disk]]s); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.\n\n==={{anchor|3.5|3.5-inch floppy disk|microfloppy}}{{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disk===\n[[File:Floppy disk internal diagram.svg|thumb|upright|Internal parts of a {{frac|3|1|2}}\u2011inch floppy disk.\n<br />'''1)''' A hole that indicates a high-capacity disk.\n<br />'''2)''' The hub that engages with the drive motor.\n<br />'''3)''' A shutter that protects the surface when removed from the drive.\n<br />'''4)''' The plastic housing.\n<br />'''5)''' A polyester sheet reducing friction against the disk media as it rotates within the housing.\n<br />'''6)''' The magnetic coated plastic disk.\n<br />'''7)''' A schematic representation of one sector of data on the disk; the tracks and sectors are not visible on actual disks.\n<br />'''8)''' The [[write protection]] tab (unlabeled) is upper left.]]\n\n[[File:Floppy Disk Drive SDF-321B.jpg|thumb|left|A {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disk drive.]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, a number of manufacturers introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats. A consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disk (actually 90&nbsp;mm wide) a.k.a. '''Micro diskette''', '''Micro disk''', or '''Micro floppy''', similar to a [[Sony]] design but improved to support both single-sided and double-sided media, with formatted capacities generally of 360 KB and 720 KB respectively. Single-sided drives shipped in 1983,<ref>{{cite journal |author-last=Shea |author-first=Tom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8 |title=Shrinking drives increase storage |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-13 |pages=1, 7, 8, 9, 11 |quote=Shugart is one of the major subscribers to the 3-1/2-inch micro-floppy standard, along with Sony and 20 other company...

What became the most common format, the double-sided, high-density (HD) 1.44 MB disk drive, shipped in 1986.\n\nThe first [[Macintosh]] computers use single-sided {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disks, but with 400 KB formatted capacity. These were followed in 1986 by double-sided 800 KB floppies. The higher capacity was achieved at the same recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant. Later Macs could also read and write 1.44 MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed.\n\nAll {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disks have a rectangular hole in one corner which, if obstructed, write-enabled the disk. A sliding detented piece can be moved to block or reveal the part of the rectangular hole that is sensed by the drive. The HD 1.44&nbsp;MB disks have a second, unobstructed hole in the opposite corner which identifies them as being of that capacity.\n\nIn IBM-compatible PCs, the three densities of {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disks are backwards-compatible: higher density drives can read, write and format lower density media. It is also possible to format a disk at a lower density than it was intended for, but only if the disk is first thoroughly demagnetized with a bulk eraser, as the high density format is magnetically stronger and will prevent the disk from working in lower density modes.\n\nWriting at different densities than disks were intended for, sometimes by altering or drilling holes, was possible but deprecated. The holes on the right side of a {{frac|3|1|2}}\u2011inch disk can be altered as to make some [[disk drives]] and [[operating system]]s treat the disk as one of higher or lower density, for bidirectional compatibility or economical reasons.{{clarify|date=March 2013}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Managing Disks |url=http://www.carolrpt.com/disks.htm |access-date=2006-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A question of floppies |url=http://www.jlaforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=22991294 |access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref> Some computers, such as the [[PS/2]] and [[Acorn Archimedes]], ignored these holes altogether.<ref>{{cite web |title=Formatting 720K Disks on a 1.44MB Floppy |work=Floppy Drive |url=http://ohlandl.ipv7.net/floppy/floppy.html#Format_720K_On_144MB |access-date=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to make a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disk drive be recognized by a system as a {{frac|5|1|4}}\u2011inch 360 KB or 1200 KB drive, and to read and write disks with the same number of tracks and sectors as those disks; this had some application in data exchange with obsolete [[CP/M]] systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n===Other sizes===\n{{main|Floppy disk variants}}\n\nOther, smaller, floppy sizes were proposed, especially for portable or pocket-sized devices that needed a smaller storage device. 3-inch disks similar in construction to {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch were manufactured and used for a time, particularly by [[Amstrad#Computer product lines|Amstrad]] computers and word processors.

Spare, hidden and otherwise reserved sectors are included in this number.\n* For {{frac|5|1|4}}- and {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch capacities quoted are from subsystem or system vendor statements.\n\nMarketed capacity is the capacity, typically unformatted, by the original media OEM vendor or in the case of IBM media, the first OEM thereafter. Other formats may get more or less capacity from the same drives and disks.\n|}\n\n[[File:Box of floppy disks and USB memory stick.jpg|thumb|right|A box of about 80 floppy disks together with one USB memory stick. The stick is capable of holding over 130 times as much data as the entire box of disks put together.]]\nData is generally written to floppy disks in sectors (angular blocks) and tracks (concentric rings at a constant radius). For example, the HD format of {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy disks uses 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, 80 tracks per side and two sides, for a total of 1,474,560 bytes per disk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lintech.org/comp-per/08FDK.pdf |title=Chapter 8: Floppy Disk Drives |access-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> Some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user's request, increasing storage on the disk, although they may not be able to be read on machines with other controllers. For example, [[Microsoft]] applications were often distributed on {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch 1.68 MB [[Distribution Media Format|DMF]] disks formatted with 21 sectors instead of 18; they could still be recognized by a standard controller. On the [[IBM PC]], [[MSX]] and most other microcomputer platforms, disks were written using a [[constant angular velocity]] (CAV) format,<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location.\n\nBecause the sectors have constant angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more near the disk's center. A more space-efficient technique would be to increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is [[zone bit recording]]. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 80 KB on a double-sided disk.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Original Macintosh |url=http://www.folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&index=75&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=high}}</ref> This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers. Apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on HD floppy disks with their later machines, still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable-speed formats.\n\n[[Disk formatting]] is usually done by a utility program supplied by the computer [[operating system|OS]] manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as \"bad sectors\") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk does not include the sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. [[Distribution Media Format|DMF]] was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.\n\n[[Binary prefix#Floppy drives|Mixtures]] of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to properly calculate total capacity. Whereas semiconductor memory naturally favors powers of two (size doubles each time an address pin is added to the integrated circuit), the capacity of a disk drive is the product of sector size, sectors per track, tracks per side and sides (which in hard disk drives with multiple platters can be greater than 2). Although other sector sizes have been known in the past, formatted sector sizes are now almost always set to powers of two (256 bytes, 512 bytes, etc.), and, in some cases, disk capacity is calculated as multiples of the sector size rather than only in bytes, leading to a combination of decimal multiples of sectors and binary sector sizes. For example, 1.44&nbsp;MB {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch HD disks have the \"M\" prefix peculiar to their context, coming from their capacity of 2,880 512-byte sectors (1,440 KiB), consistent with neither a decimal [[megabyte]] nor a binary [[mebibyte]] (MiB). Hence, these disks hold 1.47&nbsp;MB or 1.41&nbsp;MiB. Usable data capacity is a function of the disk format used, which in turn is determined by the FDD controller and its settings. Differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately 1300 to 1760 KiB (1.80 MB) on a standard {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch high-density floppy (and up to nearly 2 MB with utilities such as [[2M (DOS)|2M/2MGUI]]). The highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of drive head geometry between drives, something not always possible and unreliable. For example, the [[LS-240]] drive supports a 32&nbsp;MB capacity on standard {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch HD disks,<ref>{{cite web |title=PROPERTIES OF STORAGE SYSTEMS |url=http://www.mtsac.edu/~rpatters/CISB11/Chapters/Chapter_03/Chap03/LectureMain.htm |publisher=Mt.

This represents the speed of raw data bits moving under the read head; however, the effective speed is somewhat less due to space used for headers, gaps and other format fields and can be even further reduced by delays to seek between tracks.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Electronics|IT|Apple}}\n* [[Berg connector]] for {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch floppy drive\n* [[dd (Unix)]]\n* [[Disk image]]\n* [[Don't Copy That Floppy]]\n* [[Floppy disk hardware emulator]]\n* [[Hard disk drive]]\n* [[Shugart bus]] \u2013 popular mainly for 8-inch drives, and partially for {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch\n* [[IBM Extended Density Format|XDF]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Hyperdrive\">\"Hyper drive\" was an alternative name for {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch 80-track HD floppy drives with 1.2 MB capacity.

The three disciplines in modern fencing are the  [[foil (fencing)|foil]], the [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]], and the [[sabre (fencing)|sabre]]; winning points are made through the contact with an opponent. A fourth discipline, [[singlestick]], appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is not a part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics. Based on the traditional skills of [[swordsmanship]], the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the [[Italy|Italian]] school having modified the [[Historical European martial arts|historical European martial art]] of [[classical fencing]], and the [[France|French]] school later refining the Italian system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e, and sabre. Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.\n\nCompetitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern [[Olympic Games]], the other four being [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|athletics]], [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|cycling]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|gymnastics]].\n\n==Competitive fencing==\n\n===Governing body===\n{{further|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale d'Escrime}}\n\nFencing is governed by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale d'Escrime (FIE). Today, its head office is in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland. The FIE is composed of 145 national federations, each of which is recognised by its state [[National Olympic Committee|Olympic Committee]] as the sole representative of Olympic-style fencing in that country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fie.org/|title=INTERNATIONAL FENCING FEDERATION|website=fie.org}}</ref>\n\n===Rules===\n{{main|Fencing practice and techniques}}\n\nThe FIE maintains the current rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fie.ch/Fencing/Rules.aspx|title=INTERNATIONAL FENCING FEDERATION|website=fie.ch}}</ref> used by FIE sanctioned international events, including world cups, world championships and the Olympic Games. The FIE handles proposals to change the rules the first year after an Olympic year in the annual congress. The US Fencing Association has slightly different rules, but usually adheres to FIE standards.\n\n==History==\n[[File:FencingSchoolLeiden1610.jpg|thumb|Fencing School at [[Leiden University]], Netherlands 1610]]\n{{further|History of fencing}}\n\nFencing traces its roots to the development of [[swordsmanship]] for [[duel]]s and [[self defense]].

Angelo was instrumental in turning fencing into an athletic sport.]]\nHe established the essential rules of [[Human position|posture]] and [[Footwork (martial arts)|footwork]] that still govern modern [[sport fencing]], although his attacking and [[Parry (fencing)|parry]]ing methods were still much different from current practice. Although he intended to prepare his students for real combat, he was the first fencing master to emphasize the [[health]] and sporting benefits of fencing more than its use as a killing art, particularly in his influential book ''L'\u00c9cole des armes'' (''The School of Fencing''), published in 1763.<ref name=\"Evangelista\"/>\n\nThe first regularized fencing competition was held at the inaugural [[Royal Tournament|Grand Military Tournament and Assault at Arms]] in 1880, held at the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]], in [[Islington]] in June.  The Tournament featured a series of competitions between [[British army|army]] officers and soldiers. Each bout was fought for five hits and the foils were pointed with black to aid the judges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fencingmuseum.com/Large/2013/2013-01-latest-Essay.htm|title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF FENCING WEAPONS |author=Malcolm Fare}}</ref> The [[British Gymnastics|Amateur Gymnastic & Fencing Association]] drew up an official set of fencing regulations in 1896.\n\nFencing was part of the [[Olympic Games]] in the [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|summer of 1896]]. Sabre events have been held at every [[Summer Olympics]]; foil events have been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908; \u00e9p\u00e9e events have been held at every Summer Olympics except in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|summer of 1896]] because of unknown reasons.\n\nStarting with [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]] in 1933, side judges were replaced by the Laurent-Pagan electrical scoring apparatus,<ref>Alaux, Michel. ''Modern Fencing: Foil, Epee, and Sabre''. Scribner's, 1975, p. 83.</ref> with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed. [[Foil (fencing)|Foil]] was automated in 1956, [[Sabre (fencing)|sabre]] in 1988. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than before.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/fencing-equipment3.htm|title=How Fencing Equipment Works|last=Freudenrich|first=Craig|date=21 Sep 2000|website=How Stuff Works|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n===Weapons===\nThere are three weapons in modern fencing: foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e, and sabre.  Each weapon has its own rules and strategies. Equipment needed includes at least 2 swords, a Lame (not for \u00e9p\u00e9e), a white jacket, underarm protector, two body and mask cords, knee high socks, glove and knickers.\n\n====Foil====\n[[File:Fencing foil valid surfaces 2009.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Valid foil targets]]\n{{Main|Foil (fencing)}}\nThe foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams.  The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs.  The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs.  As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside the target area (called an ''off-target touch'' and signaled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the [[referee]] uses the rules of \"right of way\" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded.  If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.\n\n====\u00c9p\u00e9e====\n[[File:Fencing epee valid surfaces.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Valid \u00e9p\u00e9e targets]]\n{{Main|\u00c9p\u00e9e}}\n\nThe \u00e9p\u00e9e is a thrusting weapon like the foil, but heavier, with a maximum total weight of 775 grams.  In \u00e9p\u00e9e, the entire body is valid target.  The hand guard on the \u00e9p\u00e9e is a large circle that extends towards the pommel, effectively covering the hand, which is a valid target in \u00e9p\u00e9e.  Like foil, all hits must be with the tip and not the sides of the blade.  Hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action).  As the entire body is legal target, there is no concept of an off-target touch, except if the fencer accidentally strikes the floor, setting off the light and tone on the scoring apparatus.  Unlike foil and sabre, \u00e9p\u00e9e does not use \"right of way\", and awards simultaneous touches to both fencers. However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a double touch is scored, the point is null and void.\n\n====Sabre====\n[[File:Fencing saber valid surfaces.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Valid sabre targets]]\n{{Main|Sabre (fencing)}}\n\nThe sabre is a light cutting and thrusting weapon that targets the entire body above the waist, except the weapon hand. Saber is the newest weapon to be used.  Like the foil, the maximum legal weight of a sabre is 500 grams.   The hand guard on the sabre extends from hilt to the point at which the blade connects to the pommel. This guard is generally turned outwards during sport to protect the sword arm from touches. Hits with the entire blade or point are valid. As in foil, touches that land outside the target area are not scored. However, unlike foil, these ''off-target'' touches do not stop the action, and the fencing continues. In the case of both fencers landing a scoring touch, the referee determines which fencer receives the point for the action, again through the use of \"right of way\".\n\n===Protective clothing===\nMost [[personal protective equipment]] for fencing is made of tough [[cotton]] or [[nylon]]. [[Kevlar]] was added to top level uniform pieces (jacket, breeches, underarm protector, lam\u00e9, and the bib of the mask) following the death of [[Vladimir Viktorovich Smirnov|Vladimir Smirnov]] at the 1982 World Championships in [[Rome]]. However, Kevlar breaks down into [[chlorine]] in [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light, complicating the cleaning process.\n\nOther ballistic fabrics, such as [[Dyneema]], have been developed that [[Puncture resistance|resist puncture]], and which do not degrade the way that Kevlar does. FIE rules state that tournament wear must be made of fabric that resists a force of {{convert|800|N}}, and that the mask bib must resist twice that amount.\n\nThe complete fencing kit includes:\n\n;Jacket\n:The jacket is form-fitting, and has a strap (''croissard'') that passes between the legs. In sabre fencing, jackets are cut along the waist.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} A small [[gorget]] of folded fabric is sewn in around the collar to prevent an opponent's blade from slipping under the mask and along the jacket upwards towards the neck. Fencing instructors may wear a heavier jacket, such as one reinforced by plastic foam, to deflect the frequent hits an instructor endures.\n;Plastron\n:A [[plastron]] is an underarm protector worn underneath the jacket. It provides double protection on the side of the sword arm and upper arm. There is no seam under the arm, which would line up with the jacket seam and provide a weak spot.\n;Glove\n:The sword hand is protected by a [[glove]] with a gauntlet that prevents blades from going up the sleeve and causing injury. The glove also improves grip.\n;Breeches\n:[[Breeches]] or [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]] are short trousers that end just below the knee.  The breeches are required to have 10&nbsp;cm of overlap with the jacket.  Most are equipped with suspenders (braces).\n;Socks\n:Fencing socks are long enough to cover the knee; some cover most of the thigh.\n;Shoes\n:Fencing shoes have flat soles, and are reinforced on the inside for the back foot, and in the heel for the front foot. The reinforcement prevents wear from lunging.\n;Mask\n:The fencing mask has a bib that protects the neck. The mask should support {{convert|12|kg|lb}} on the metal mesh and {{convert|350|N}} of penetration resistance on the bib. FIE regulations dictate that masks must withstand {{convert|25|kg|lb}} on the mesh and {{convert|1600|N}} on the bib. Some modern masks have a see-through visor in the front of the mask. These have been used at high level competitions (World Championships etc.), however, they are currently banned in foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e by the FIE, following a 2009 incident in which a visor was pierced during the European Junior Championship competition. There are foil, sabre, and three-weapon masks.\n;Chest protector\n:A chest protector, made of plastic, is worn by female fencers and, sometimes, by boys. Fencing instructors also wear them, as they are hit far more often during training than their students. In foil fencing, the hard surface of a chest protector decreases the likelihood that a hit registers.\n;Lam\u00e9\n:A lam\u00e9 is a layer of electrically conductive material worn over the fencing jacket in foil and sabre fencing. The lam\u00e9 covers the entire target area, and makes it easier to determine whether a hit fell within the target area. (In \u00e9p\u00e9e fencing the lam\u00e9 is unnecessary, since the target area spans the competitor's entire body.) In sabre fencing, the lam\u00e9's sleeves end in a straight line across the wrist; in foil fencing, the lam\u00e9 is sleeveless. A [[body cord]] is necessary to register scoring. It attaches to the weapon and runs inside the jacket sleeve, then down the back and out to the scoring box. In sabre and foil fencing, the body cord connects to the lam\u00e9 in order to create a circuit to the scoring box.\n;Sleeve\n:An instructor or master may wear a protective sleeve or a leg leather to protect their fencing arm or leg, respectively.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Elements of protective clothing\" mode=packed heights=155>\nFile:Fencing jacket.jpg|Jacket\nFile:Fencing glove.jpg|Glove\nFile:Fencing plastron.jpg|Sous-Plastron\nFile:Fencing knickers.jpg|Breeches/<wbr>Knickers\nFile:Fencingmask.jpg|Mask\nFile:Chest protector.jpg|Chest protector for women\n</gallery>\n\nTraditionally, the fencer's uniform is white, and an instructor's uniform is black. This may be due to the occasional pre-electric practice of covering the point of the weapon in dye, soot, or colored chalk in order to make it easier for the referee to determine the placing of the touches.  As this is no longer a factor in the electric era, the FIE rules have been relaxed to allow colored uniforms (save black). The guidelines also limit the permitted size and positioning of sponsorship logos.\n\n===Grips===\n\nSome pistol grips used by foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e fencers (main article [[Grip (sport fencing)]])\n<gallery heights=150 mode=packed>\nFile:Absolute visconti.jpg|Visconti grip\nFile:Uhlmann Belgian.jpg|Belgian grip\nFile:Russian grip.jpg|Russian grip\nFile:Hungarian grip.jpg|Hungarian grip\n</gallery>\n\n===Electric equipment===\nA set of electric fencing equipment is required to participate in electric fencing. Electric equipment in fencing varies depending on the weapon with which it is used in accordance. The main component of a set of electric equipment is the [[body cord]]. The '''body cord''' serves as the connection between a fencer and a reel of wire that is part of a system for electrically detecting that the weapon has touched the opponent. There are two types: one for [[\u00c9p\u00e9e (Fencing)|\u00e9p\u00e9e]], and one for [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] and [[Sabre (fencing)|sabre]].\n\n\u00c9p\u00e9e body cords consist of two sets of three prongs each connected by a wire. One set plugs into the fencer's weapon, with the other connecting to the reel. Foil and sabre body cords have only two prongs (or a twist-lock bayonet connector) on the weapon side, with the third wire connecting instead to the fencer's lam\u00e9. The need in foil and sabre to distinguish between on and off-target touches requires a wired connection to the valid target area.\n\nA body cord consists of three wires known as the A, B, and C lines. At the reel connector (and both connectors for \u00c9p\u00e9e cords) The B pin is in the middle, the A pin is 1.5&nbsp;cm to one side of B, and the C pin is 2&nbsp;cm to the other side of B. This asymmetrical arrangement ensures that the cord cannot be plugged in the wrong way around.\n\nIn foil, the A line is connected to the lam\u00e9 and the B line runs up a wire to the tip of the weapon. The B line is normally connected to the C line through the tip. When the tip is depressed, the circuit is broken and one of three things can happen:\n[[File:Sabre Body Cord.png|thumb|A foil/sabre body cord. Left to right: alligator clip, connection to reel, connection to weapon.]]\n* The tip is touching your opponent's [[Lam\u00e9 (fencing)|lam\u00e9]] (their A line): Valid touch\n* The tip is touching your opponent's weapon or the grounded strip: nothing, as the current is still flowing to the C line.\n* The tip is not touching either  of the above: Off-target hit (white light).\nIn \u00c9p\u00e9e, the A and B lines run up separate wires to the tip (there is no lam\u00e9). When the tip is depressed, it connects the A and B lines, resulting in a valid touch. However, if the tip is touching your opponents weapon (their C line) or the grounded strip, nothing happens when it is depressed, as the current is redirected to the C line. Grounded strips are particularly important in \u00c9p\u00e9e, as without one, a touch to the floor registers as a valid touch (rather than off-target as in Foil).\n\nIn Sabre, similarly to Foil, the A line is connected to the lam\u00e9, but both the B and C lines are connected to the body of the weapon. Any contact between your B/C line (doesn't matter which, as they are always connected) and your opponent's A line (their lam\u00e9) results in a valid touch. There is no need for grounded strips in Sabre, as hitting something other than your opponent's lame does nothing.\n[[File:Lam\u00e9.png|thumb|A foil lam\u00e9 conductive vest]]\nIn a professional fencing competition, a complete set of electric equipment is needed.\n\nA complete set of foil electric equipment includes:\n* An electric [[body cord]], which runs under the fencer's jacket on his/her dominate side. \n* An electric blade.\n* A conductive lam\u00e9 or electric vest.\n* A conductive bib (often attached to the mask).\n* An electric mask cord, connecting the conductive bib and the lam\u00e9. \nThe electric equipment of sabre is very similar to that of foil. In addition, equipment used in sabre includes:\n* A larger conductive lame.\n* An electric sabre.\n* A completely conductive mask.\n* A conductive glove or overlay.\n\u00c9p\u00e9e fencers lack a lam\u00e9, conductive bib, and head cord due to their target area. Also, their body cords are constructed differently as described above. However, they possess all of the other components of a foil fencer's equipment.\n\n==Foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e, and sabre techniques<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bhutta|first=Omar|year=2016|title=USA Fencing Rules|url=http://assets.ngin.com/attachments/document/0105/8552/2016-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf|journal=United States Fencing Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>==\n{{See also|Glossary of fencing}}\nTechniques or movements in fencing can be divided into two categories: offensive and defensive. Some techniques can fall into both categories (''e.g.'' the beat). Certain techniques are used offensively, with the purpose of landing a hit on your opponent while holding the right of way (foil and sabre). Others are used defensively, to protect against a hit or obtain the right of way.\n\nThe attacks and defences may be performed in countless combinations of feet and hand actions. For example, fencer A attacks the arm of fencer B, drawing a high outside parry; fencer B then follows the parry with a high line riposte. Fencer A, expecting that, then makes his own parry by pivoting his blade under fencer B's weapon (from straight out to more or less straight down), putting fencer B's tip off target and fencer A now scoring against the low line by angulating the hand upwards.\n\nWhenever a point is scored, the fencers will go back to their starting mark. The fight will start again after the following commands have been given by the referee (in French in international settings): \"En garde\" (On guard), \"\u00cates-vous pr\u00eats ?\" (Are you ready?), \"Allez\" (Fence!).\n\n===Offensive===\n* [[Attack (fencing)|Attack]]: A basic fencing technique, also called a thrust, consisting of the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent's target. They are four different attacks (straight thrust, disengage attack, counter-disengage attack and cutover)  In sabre, attacks are also made with a cutting action.\n* Riposte:  An attack by the defender after a successful parry.  After the attacker has completed their attack, and it has been parried, the defender then has the opportunity to make an attack, and (at foil and sabre) take right of way.\n* [[Feint]]: A false attack with the purpose of provoking a reaction from the opposing fencer.\n* [[Lunge (fencing)|Lunge]]: A thrust while extending the front leg by using a slight kicking motion and propelling the body forward with the back leg.\n* Beat attack: In foil and sabre, the attacker beats the opponent's blade to gain priority (right of way) and continues the attack against the target area.  In \u00e9p\u00e9e, a similar beat is made but with the intention to disturb the opponent's aim and thus score with a single light.\n* Disengage: A blade action whereby the blade is moved around the opponent's blade to threaten a different part of the target or deceive a parry.\n* Compound attack: An attack preceded by one or more feints which oblige the opponent to parry, allowing the attacker to deceive the parry.\n* Continuation/renewal of Attack: A typical \u00e9p\u00e9e action of making a 2nd attack after the first attack is parried. This may be done with a change in line; for example, an attack in the high line (above the opponent's bellguard, such as the shoulder) is then followed with an attack to the low line (below the opponent's bellguard, such as the thigh, or foot); or from the outside line (outside the bellguard, such as outer arm) to the inside line (inside the bellguard, such as the inner arm or the chest). A second continuation is stepping slight past the parry and angulating the blade to bring the tip of the blade back on target. A renewal may also be direct (without a change of line or any further blade action), in which case it is called a remise. In foil or sabre, a renewal is considered to have lost right of way, and the defender's immediate riposte, if it lands, will score instead of the renewal.\n* Flick: a technique used primarily in foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e.  It takes advantage of the extreme flexibility of the blade to use it like a whip, bending the blade so that it curves over and strikes the opponent with the point; this allows the fencer to hit an obscured part of the target (e.g., the back of the shoulder or, at \u00e9p\u00e9e, the wrist even when it is covered by the guard).  This technique has become much more difficult due to timing changes which require the point to stay depressed for longer to set off the light.\n\n===Defensive===\n* [[Parry (fencing)|Parry]]: Basic defence technique, block the opponent's weapon while it is preparing or executing an attack to deflect the blade away from the fencer's valid area and (in foil and sabre) to give fencer the right of way. Usually followed by a riposte, a return attack by the defender.\n* Circle parry: A parry where the weapon is moved in a circle to catch the opponent's tip and deflect it away.\n* Counter attack: A basic fencing technique of attacking your opponent while generally moving back out of the way of the opponent's attack.  Used quite often in \u00e9p\u00e9e to score against the attacker's hand/arm. More difficult to accomplish in foil and sabre unless one is quick enough to make the counterattack and retreat ahead of the advancing opponent without being scored upon, or by evading the attacking blade via moves such as the In Quartata (turning to the side) or Passata-sotto (ducking). Counterattacks can also be executed in opposition, grazing along the opponent's blade and deflecting it to cause the attack to miss.\n* Point-in-line:  A specific position where the arm is straight and the point is threatening the opponent's target area. In foil and sabre, this gives one priority if the extension is completed before the opponent begins the final action of their attack.  When performed as a defensive action, the attacker must then disturb the extended weapon to re-take priority; otherwise the defender has priority and the point-in-line will win the touch if the attacker does not manage a single light.  In \u00e9p\u00e9e, there is no priority; the move may be used as a means by either fencer to achieve a double-touch and advance the score by 1 for each fencer. In all weapons, the point-in-line position is commonly used to slow the opponent's advance and cause them to delay the execution of their attack.\n\n==Universities and schools==\n{{See also|Collegiate Fencing| High School Fencing}}\n\nFencing has a long history with universities and schools for at least 500 years. At least one style of fencing, [[Academic fencing|Mensur]] in Germany, is practiced only within universities, notably at Heidelberg. University students compete internationally at the [[Universiade|World University Games]]. The United States holds two national level university tournaments including the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] championship and the [[USACFC]] National Championships<ref>[http://usacfc.org USACFC].in 's USACFC. Retrieved on 2012-05-16.</ref> tournaments in the USA and the [[British Universities and Colleges Sport|BUCS]] fencing championships in the United Kingdom. Prior to advances in modern weaponry post World War I, the [[United States Cavalry]] taught swordsmanship (mounted and dismounted) in [[Fort Riley]], Kansas at its [[Mounted Service School]]. [[George S. Patton Jr.]], while still a young lieutenant, was named \"[[Master of the Sword]],\" an honor reserved for the top instructor. He invented what came to be known as the \"Patton Saber,\" in 1913, based on his studies with M. Clery L'Adjutant, reputed to be the finest Fencing Master in Europe at the time. While teaching at Fort Riley, he wrote two training manuals teaching the art of swordsmanship to Army Cavalry Officers, \"Saber Exercise 1914\"<ref>Patton, George S. Jr. \"Saber Exercise.\" Silver Spring, MD: Dale Street Books, 2016.</ref> and \"Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship.\" <ref>Patton, George S. Jr. \"Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship.\" Silver Spring, MD: Dale Street Books, 2016.</ref> Equipment costs and the relatively small scale of the sport limits university fencing to a small number of schools. National fencing organisations have set up programmes to encourage more students to fence. Examples include the Regional Youth Circuit program<ref>US Fencing Youth Development Website, [http://www.usfaryc.org/Welcome.html Regional Youth Circuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712223939/http://www.usfaryc.org/Welcome.html |date=2007-07-12 }}.</ref> in the USA and the Leon Paul Youth Development series in the UK.\n\nIn recent years, attempts have been made to introduce fencing to a wider and younger audience, by using foam and plastic swords, which require much less protective equipment. This makes it much less expensive to provide classes, and thus easier to take fencing to a wider range of schools than traditionally has been the case.

McClurg & Co., 1908</ref> \nFor the first time Venetian fencing was detailed in some directions, it was described the properties of different parts of the blade, which were used in defense and offense. With this approach, the swordsman had an idea of one thing, what now we calling like \"center of percussion\". It was suggested some divisions of a sword. The blade was divided into four parts, the first two parts from Ephesus should be used for protection; the third one near the center of the blow was used for striking; and the fourth part at the tip was used for pricking.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Other variants==\nOther variants include [[wheelchair fencing]] for those with disabilities, chair fencing, ''one-hit \u00e9p\u00e9e'' (one of the five events which constitute [[modern pentathlon]]) and the various types of non-Olympic competitive fencing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.teamusa.org/home/us%20paralympics/sports/fencing.aspx|title=U.S. Paralympics {{!}} Sports {{!}} Wheelchair Fencing|work=Team USA|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>  Chair fencing is similar to wheelchair fencing, but for the able bodied.  The opponents set up opposing chairs and fence while seated; all the usual rules of fencing are applied.  An example of the latter is the [[American Fencing League]] (distinct from the [[United States Fencing Association]]): the format of competitions is different and the right of way rules are interpreted in a different way. In a number of countries, school and university matches deviate slightly from the FIE format.

First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.  Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.}}\n\nIn 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ru.j-npcs.org/usoft/WWW/www_gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en |title=What is Free Software? - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Ru.j-npcs.org |date=1997-03-20 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en |title=What is Free Software? - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980126185518/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |archivedate=January 26, 1998 }}</ref>  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\nFinally, another freedom was added, to explicitly say that users should be able to run the program. The existing freedoms were already numbered one to three, but this freedom should come before the others, so it was added as \"freedom zero\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en#f1|title=What is free software? - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (Footnote)|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|quote=\"The reason they are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3 is historical. Around 1990 there were three freedoms, numbered 1, 2 and 3. Then we realized that the freedom to run the program needed to be mentioned explicitly. It was clearly more basic than the other three, so it properly should precede them. Rather than renumber the others, we made it freedom 0.\"|date=2018-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/|title=The Four Freedoms|quote=I [Matt Mullenweg] originally thought Stallman started counting with zero instead of one because he's a geek. He is, but that wasn't the reason. Freedoms one, two, and three came first, but later he wanted to add something to supersede all of them. So: freedom zero. The geekness is a happy accident.}}</ref>\n\nThe modern definition defines free software by whether or not the recipient has the following four freedoms:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en\n|title=The Free Software Definition\n|first=Richard\n|last=Stallman\n|publisher=Free Software Foundation\n|accessdate=2013-10-15\n}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n*The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).\n*The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).

By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.}}\n\nFreedoms 1 and 3 require [[source code]] to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code is highly impractical.\n\n==Later definitions==\nIn July 1997, [[Bruce Perens]] published the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Bruce Perens\n|url=http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-1997/msg00017.html\n|title=Debian's \"Social Contract\" with the Free Software Community\n|work=debian-announce mailing list\n}}</ref> A definition based on the DFSG was also used by the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) under the name \"''The Open Source Definition''\".\n\n==Comparison with ''The Open Source Definition''==\n{{Main|Alternative terms for free software}}\n{{See also|Comparison of free and open-source software licenses}}\nDespite the philosophical differences between the [[free software movement]] and the [[Open-source software movement]], the official definitions of [[free software]] by the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] and of [[open source software]] by the [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] basically refer to the same software licences, with a few minor exceptions. While stressing the philosophical differences, the Free Software Foundation comments:\n{{quote|The term \"open source\" software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licences that we consider too restrictive, and there are free software licences they have not accepted.

After leaving CERN, he returned to [[Stanford University]], where he in 1961 was made [[Max Stein]] Professor of Physics.\n\nAt Stanford, he was the advisor of [[Carson D. Jeffries]], who became a professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn 1964, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00002770 |title=F.
