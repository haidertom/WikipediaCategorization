Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing [[privilege escalation]], or a [[denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack]].\n\n==Classification==\nThere are several methods of classifying exploits. The most common is by how the exploit communicates to the vulnerable software.\n\nA ''remote exploit''<ref>{{cite web|title=Remote Exploits - Exploit Database|url=https://www.exploit-db.com/remote/|website=www.exploit-db.com}}</ref> works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system.\n\nA ''local exploit''<ref>{{cite web|title=Privilege Escalation and Local Exploits - Exploit Database|url=https://www.exploit-db.com/local/|website=www.exploit-db.com}}</ref> requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. Exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application.\n\nExploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. Another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples.\n\nMany exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. However, it is also possible to use several exploits, first to gain low-level access, then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches the highest administrative level (often called \"root\").\n\nAfter an exploit is made known to the authors of the affected software, the vulnerability is often fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes unusable. That is the reason why some [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] as well as military or intelligence agencies hackers do not publish their exploits but keep them private.\n\nExploits unknown to everyone but the people that found and developed them are referred to as ''[[Zero-day (computing)|zero day]] exploits''.\n\n===Types===\nExploitations are commonly categorized and named<ref>{{cite web|title=Exploits Database by Offensive Security|url=https://www.exploit-db.com/|website=www.exploit-db.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exploit Database {{!}} Rapid7|url=https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/|website=www.rapid7.com}}</ref> by the type of vulnerability they exploit (see [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] for a list), whether they are local/remote and the result of running the exploit (e.g. [[Elevation of Privilege (computing)|EoP]], [[Denial of Service (computing)|DoS]], [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]]).\n\n===Pivoting===\n'''Pivoting''' refers to a method used by [[penetration test]]ers that uses the compromised system to attack other systems on the same network to avoid restrictions such as [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] configurations, which may prohibit direct access to all machines. For example, if an attacker compromises a web server on a corporate network, the attacker can then use the compromised web server to attack other systems on the network. These types of attacks are often called multi-layered attacks. Pivoting is also known as ''island hopping''.\n\nPivoting can further be distinguished into [[Proxy server|proxy]] pivoting and [[VPN]] pivoting. '''Proxy pivoting''' generally describes the practice of channeling traffic through a compromised target using a proxy payload on the machine and launching attacks from the computer.<ref><!--is this a separate source?

By attacking a vulnerable piece of networking, an attacker could infect most or all of a network and gain complete control.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Computer security]]\n* [[Computer virus]]\n* [[Crimeware]]\n* [[Exploit kit]]\n* ''[[Hacking: The Art of Exploitation]]'' (second edition)\n* [[IT risk]]\n* [[Metasploit Project|Metasploit]]\n* [[Shellcode]]\n* [[w3af]]\n* [[Sqlmap]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Kahsari Alhadi, Milad.

Its lead designer was [[Jonathan Tweet]].  Marketed as a \"Visionary Roleplaying Game\", it has often been characterized as an innovative piece with a limited commercial success. Wizards later abandoned the line, and [[Rubicon Games]] purchased it, and published several supplements. The line was sold again to [[Gaslight Press]] in February 2001.\n\nThe game has a fantasy setting of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] type, with many different worlds, some of which differed from generic fantasy. It appears to have been heavily influenced by [[divinatory tarot]], the four [[classical element]]s of [[History of Ancient Greece|ancient Greece]], and [[mythology|mythologies]] from around the world.\n\nEverway was first with implementing, in a commercial game, several new concepts including much more picture-based/visual source material and character creation than usual. Like other works by [[Jonathan Tweet]], the rules are very simple and flexible. It is also one of a few [[diceless role-playing game]]s.  The Fortune Deck works as a randomizer and inspirational tool, and the results obtained by it are highly subjective. In order to clarify their use, Tweet coined some new vocabulary to describe and formalize methods of gamemaster adjudication; these terms have been adopted by the wider tabletop RPG community. Tweet's adjudication terms are: Karma (making a decision based on character abilities, tactics, and the internal logic of a fictional situation), Drama (making a decision based on what moves the story along), and Fortune (letting a randomizer &mdash; drawing a card in ''Everway'', but could also refer to rolling dice in other games &mdash; determine the outcome).  The original edition contained the \"Fortune\" deck of thirty-six cards, used for \"divination\" and action-resolution, as well as ninety \"Vision\" cards used as source material. Each Vision card depicts a fantastic scene of some sort and is backed with a series of [[leading question]]s such as, \"What does this person most enjoy?\" or \"What's the worst thing that could happen in this situation?\" The game's box also had three books of source material and game-playing tips: a Player's Guide, Game Master's Guide, and Guide to the Fortune Deck.\n\nThe Fortune cards were illustrated by [[Scott Kirschner]] and [[Jeff Miracola]].\n\n== Setting ==\nThe official setting for Everway revolves around heroes with the power of \"spherewalking,\" traveling between worlds called \"spheres.\" Spheres typically consist of many \"realms.\" The city of Everway is located in a realm called Roundwander, in the sphere called Fourcorner. Roundwander is the only realm in Fourcorner that is described. There is some detail on the sphere's main city, Everway, which contains a stone pyramid, a set of family-oriented guilds, and various exotic events related to the city's position as an inter-dimensional trading center. Several dozen other spheres are described as one-sentence blurbs, a few as page-long summaries, and one in detail as the setting for a sample adventure, \"Journey to Stonekeep.\" The theme is strongly fantasy-oriented as opposed to science fictional, with advanced technology explicitly forbidden in the character creation rules. The authors gave significant thought to [[anthropology]] by describing how the people of various spheres live, including many similarities across cultures. Some of these common features are entirely realistic (language, art), and others plainly related to the game's fantasy elements (magic, knowledge of the Fortune Deck). Nearly all spheres are inhabited by humans, with mostly realistic physics.\n\n==Character creation ==\nCharacter design is abstract and simple by most role-playing games' standards. Each character begins with twenty points to divide between four Element scores roughly equivalent to statistics for Strength (Fire), Perception (Water), Intelligence (Air) and Endurance (Earth). Scores range from 1 (pathetic) to 3 (average) to 10 (godlike), so a generic hero would have scores of 5. Each Element also has a specialty for which a character can get a 1-point bonus; e.g., a 5-Air hero with an Air specialty of \"Writing\" could write as though their Air score were 6. As a general rule a statistic of N is twice as capable as a level of N-1, where this makes sense. (A 5-Fire, 5-Earth hero can typically defeat two 4-Fire, 5-Earth enemies, or handily defeat a 3-Fire, 5-Earth character in foot race, but cannot necessarily run twice as fast even though speed is governed by Fire.)\n\nEach character also has Powers representing unusual abilities. These cost from 0 to 3 or more points depending on whether they should be considered Frequent, Major (or even \"Twice Major\", for especially powerful abilities that significantly affect gameplay) and/or Versatile. For instance, a \"Cat Familiar,\" a slightly intelligent cat, is arguably worth 2 points for being Frequent (usually around and often useful) and Versatile (able to scout, carry messages, and fight). A \"Winning Smile\" that makes the hero likable is worth 0 points because of its trivial effect, while a \"Charming Song\" that inspires one emotion when played might be useful enough to count as Frequent (1 point). There is no strict rule for deciding what a Power is worth. Each hero can have one 0-point Power for free; additional Powers that would otherwise cost 0 points instead cost 1.\n\nMagic is also abstract. A hero wanting access to magic, as opposed to a few specific Powers, must design their own magic system. This is done by choosing an Element for its basis, which affects its theme; e.g., Air is associated with speech and intellect and would be suitable for a system of spoken spells gained through study. The new Magic statistic has a 1\u201310 rating and point cost, and can be no higher than the Element on what it is based. The game's rules suggest listing examples of what the magic system can do at each power level, working these out with the GM. It is suggested that most characters do not need magic and that it is not suitable for new players.\n\nFinally, each hero has personality traits based on the game's Fortune and Vision cards. Players are to choose one or more Vision cards and base a [[backstory]] on them, and to have three Fortune cards representing a Virtue, Fault, and Fate (a challenge they will face). These three cards can change to represent new phases in the hero's life. There is a list of suggested Motives for why the hero is adventuring, such as \"Adversity\" or \"Wanderlust\", but this feature has no gameplay effect.\n\nEquipment such as weaponry is handled completely abstractly, with no specific rules for item cost, carrying capacity, or combat statistics. However, a particularly powerful piece of equipment\u2014for example, a cloak that renders its wearer invisible for a brief period\u2014may be treated as a Power that the hero must spend their initial element points on.\n\n== The Fortune Deck ==\nTo decide what happens, the GM considers the rules of Karma (characters' abilities, tactics, logic), Drama (the needs of the plot), and Fortune, the result of a card drawn from the Fortune Deck. Many of these cards are based on the \"Major Arcana\" of [[tarot divination]], such as \"The Fool\" and \"Death\", but the deck includes original cards such as \"Drowning in Armor\" and \"Law.\" As with the Tarot deck there is symbolic art and each card has two complementary meanings when upright or reversed (while face up). The meanings are printed on the cards (e.g., \"Protective Measures Turn Dangerous\" vs. \"True Prudence\" for \"Drowning in Armor\") and explained more fully in the game's books. The rules are flexible about how often the GM should consult the Fortune Deck, whether the cards should be shown to players, and how much influence the draw should have\u2014it is entirely acceptable for the GM to never use the deck at all, if she so desires. Though cards sometimes have obvious interpretations for the context in which they are drawn, the rules explain that sometimes they are best read simply as \"a positive (or negative) result.\"\n\nAlthough the Fortune Deck resembles (and can be used as) a fortune-telling device, Everway treats the Deck only as a storytelling device and an element of the fictional setting. It does not in any way endorse \"real\" fortune-telling or other supernatural concepts.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20021203022040/http://www.gaslightpress.com/Everway/default.asp Everway section] of Gaslight Press' web site\n* [http://www.runester.com/cgi/Wala/wala.pl?HomePage EverWiki]\n* [https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rwb/www/gaming/everweb/ Everweb] (large resource collection)\n\n[[Category:Fantasy role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Wizards of the Coast games]]\n[[Category:Jonathan Tweet games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1995]]", "sha1": "5o6dm5i9oh77mscdyxu3eh5y0gw3i8g"}}, {"title": "Expellees", "ns": "0", "id": "9880", "redirect": {"title": "Diaspora studies"}, "revision": {"id": "15907738", "parentid": "152668", "timestamp": "2002-08-12T23:58:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Toby Bartels", "id": "1078"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Redirect with stuff after it; Removed such stuff, which Julie has presumably incorporated within the new page.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Diaspora studies]]", "sha1": "ne2g0pu21k8kt1lacn0d0fhkr5qmezi"}}, {"title": "Efficient Markets Hypothesis", "ns": "0", "id": "9881", "redirect": {"title": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}, "revision": {"id": "239620397", "parentid": "15907739", "timestamp": "2008-09-19T18:28:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Redirect fixer", "id": "7523687"}, "comment": "[[Efficient market hypothesis]] has been moved; it now redirects to [[Efficient-market hypothesis]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Efficient-market hypothesis]]", "sha1": "f361312yrx8t6vn7yhvy38y2dw8il9o"}}, {"title": "Efficient markets theory", "ns": "0", "id": "9882", "redirect": {"title": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}, "revision": {"id": "239621411", "parentid": "59009515", "timestamp": "2008-09-19T18:33:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Redirect fixer", "id": "7523687"}, "comment": "[[Efficient market hypothesis]] has been moved; it now redirects to [[Efficient-market hypothesis]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Efficient-market hypothesis]]", "sha1": "f361312yrx8t6vn7yhvy38y2dw8il9o"}}, {"title": "Eurocard (printed circuit board)", "ns": "0", "id": "9883", "revision": {"id": "859210105", "parentid": "832216645", "timestamp": "2018-09-12T13:43:34Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kvng", "id": "910180"}, "comment": "terminology.

A [[DIN 41612]] connector on right side]]\n'''Eurocard''' is a European standard format for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) cards that can be plugged together into a standard chassis which, in turn, can be mounted in a [[19-inch rack]]. The chassis consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. At the spine of each card is one or more connectors which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the chassis.\n\n== Dimensions ==\nAs the cards are assumed to be installed in a vertical orientation, the usual meanings of height and width are transposed: A card might be 233.35&nbsp;mm \"high\", but only 20&nbsp;mm \"wide\".  Height is measured in [[rack unit]]s, \"U\", with 1 U being {{convert|1.75|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  This dimension refers to the subrack in which the card is to be mounted, rather than the card itself.  \n\nEnclosure heights are multiples of 3U, with the cards always {{convert|33.35|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} shorter than the enclosure.  Two common heights are 3U (a 100&nbsp;mm card in a {{convert|5.25|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} subrack) and 6U (a 233.35&nbsp;mm card in a {{convert|10.5|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} high subrack).  As two 3U cards are shorter than a 6U card (by 33.35&nbsp;mm), it is possible to install two 3U cards in one slot of a 6U subrack, with a mid-height structure for proper support. \n\nCard widths are specified in [[horizontal pitch]] units \"HP\", with 1 HP being {{convert|0.20|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.\n\nCard depths start at {{convert|100|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} and increase in {{convert|60|mm|in|3|adj=on|abbr=on}} increments. The most common today is {{convert|160|mm|in|3|adj=on|abbr=on}}, but standard hardware is available for depths of {{convert|100|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|160|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|220|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|280|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|400|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Standards and architecture ==\nThe Eurocard mechanical architecture was defined originally under [[19-inch rack|IEC-60297-3]]. Today, the most widely recognized standards for this mechanical structure are [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] 1101.1, IEEE 1101.10 (also known commonly as \"dot ten\") and IEEE 1101.11. IEEE 1101.10 covers the additional mechanical and [[electromagnetic interference]] features required for [[VMEbus International Trade Association|VITA]] 1.1-1997(R2002), which is the VME64 Extensions standard, as well as [[PICMG]] 2.0 (R3.0), which is the [[CompactPCI]] specification.\n\nThe IEEE 1101.11 standard covers rear plug-in units that are also called [[rear transition module]]s or RTMs.\n\nThe Eurocard is a mechanical system and does not define the specific connector to be used or the signals that are assigned to connector contacts.\n\nThe connector systems that are commonly used with Eurocard architectures include the original [[DIN 41612]] connector that is also standardized as IEC 60603.2. This is the connector that is used for the [[VMEbus]] standard, which was IEEE 1014. The connector known as the 5-row DIN, which is used for the VME64 Extensions standard is IEC 61076-4-113. The VME64 Extension architecture defined by VITA 1.1-1997 (R2002).\n\nAnother popular computer architecture that utilizes the 6U-160 Eurocard is [[CompactPCI]] and [[CompactPCI Express]]. These are defined by PICMG 2.0R3 and PICMG Exp0 R1 respectively. Other computer architectures that utilize the Eurocard system are [[VME eXtensions for Instrumentation]] (VXI), [[PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation]] (PXI), and [[PXI Express]].\n\nA computer architecture that used the 6U-220 Eurocard format was [[Multibus|Multibus-II]], which was IEEE 1296.\n\nBecause the Eurocard system provided for so many modular card sizes and because connector manufacturers have continued to create new connectors that are compatible with this system, it is a popular mechanical standard that is also used for innumerable \"one-off\" applications.\n\nConduction-cooled Eurocards are used in military and aerospace applications.  They are defined by the IEEE 1101.2-1992 (2001) standard.\n\nThe Eurocard standard is also the basis of the \"[[Eurorack]]\" format for [[modular synthesizer|modular electronic music synthesizers]], popularized by [[Doepfer]] and other manufacturers.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Europe Card Bus]]\n\n\n[[Category:Electronics standards]]", "sha1": "icfptieut2tnc2my4tywz2rbdb8m57t"}}, {"title": "England/City", "ns": "0", "id": "9885", "redirect": {"title": "City status in the United Kingdom"}, "revision": {"id": "564077577", "parentid": "15907742", "timestamp": "2013-07-13T08:15:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision from [[:nost:England/City]]: import old edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT[[City status in the United Kingdom]]", "sha1": "s5o0sasgiksr66nquxpapwwh0mvc2ad"}}, {"title": "England/Food and Drink", "ns": "0", "id": "9888", "redirect": {"title": "English cuisine"}, "revision": {"id": "270672236", "parentid": "270672140", "timestamp": "2009-02-14T15:12:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "moved [[England/FoodAndDrink]] to [[England/Food and Drink]]:&#32;revert", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[English cuisine]]", "sha1": "88sc2izymp50el21uu82nzy9wvy1cjt"}}, {"title": "Electron counting", "ns": "0", "id": "9890", "revision": {"id": "837051991", "parentid": "811999684", "timestamp": "2018-04-18T12:40:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision imported: import old edit from [[nost:Electron counting]], see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Electron counting''' is a formalism used for classifying compounds and for explaining or predicting electronic structure and [[chemical bond|bonding]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| issn = 0021-9584\n| volume = 83\n| pages = 791\n| last = Parkin\n| first = Gerard\n| title = Valence, Oxidation Number, and Formal Charge: Three Related but Fundamentally Different Concepts\n| journal = Journal of Chemical Education\n| accessdate = 2009-11-10\n| year = 2006\n| url = http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2006/May/abs791.html\n|bibcode = 2006JChEd..83..791P |doi = 10.1021/ed083p791 }}</ref>  Many rules in chemistry rely on electron-counting:\n\n*[[Octet rule]] is used with [[Lewis structure]]s for [[main group element]]s, especially the lighter ones such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]],\n*[[18-electron rule|Eighteen-electron rule]] in [[inorganic chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]] of [[transition metal]]s,\n*[[Polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory]] for [[cluster compound]]s, including transition metals and main group elements such as [[boron]] including [[Kenneth Wade|Wade's]] rules for [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] cluster compounds, including transition metals and main group elements and mixtures thereof.\n\nAtoms that do not obey their rule are called \"electron-deficient\" when they have too few electrons to achieve a ''[[noble gas]] configuration'', or \"hypervalent\" when they have too many electrons.

One can check one's calculation by employing both approaches.\n\nIt is important, though, to be aware that most chemical species exist between the purely covalent and ionic extremes.\n\n===Neutral counting===\n* This method begins with locating the central atom on the periodic table and determining the number of its valence electrons. One counts valence electrons for main group elements differently from transition metals.\n:E.g. in period 2: B, C, N, O, and F have 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 valence electrons, respectively.\n:E.g. in period 4: K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 valence electrons respectively.\n* One is added for every [[halide]] or other anionic ligand which binds to the central atom through a sigma bond.\n* Two is added for every lone pair bonding to the metal (e.g. each Lewis base binds with a lone pair). Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as alkenes and alkynes are considered Lewis bases. Similarly Lewis and Bronsted acids (protons) contribute nothing.\n* One is added for each homoelement bond.\n* One is added for each negative charge, and one is subtracted for each positive charge.\n\n===Ionic counting===\n* This method begins by calculating the number of electrons of the element, assuming an oxidation state\n:E.g. for a Fe<sup>2+</sup> has 6 electrons\n:S<sup>2\u2212</sup> has 8 electrons\n* Two is added for every [[halide]] or other anionic ligand which binds to the metal through a sigma bond.\n* Two is added for every lone pair bonding to the metal (e.g. each phosphine ligand can bind with a lone pair). Similarly Lewis and Bronsted acids (protons) contribute nothing.\n* For unsaturated ligands such as alkenes, one electron is added for each carbon atom binding to the metal.\n\n==Electrons donated by common fragments==\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An example of this complication is the M\u2013[[Nitrosyl|NO]] entity. When this grouping is linear, the NO ligand is considered to be a three-electron ligand.  When the M\u2013NO subunit is strongly bent at N, the NO is treated as a pseudohalide and is thus a one electron (in the neutral counting approach).  The situation is not very different from the ''\u03b7''<sup>3</sup> versus the ''\u03b7''<sup>1</sup> allyl.  Another unusual ligand from the electron counting perspective is sulfur dioxide. \n<!-- -SCN vs. -NCS? -->\n\n==Examples==\n*[[Methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]], for the central C\n:neutral counting: C contributes 4 electrons, each H radical contributes one each: 4 + 4 \u00d7 1 = 8 valence electrons\n:ionic counting: C<sup>4\u2212</sup> contributes 8 electrons, each proton contributes 0 each: 8 + 4 \u00d7 0 = 8 electrons.\n:Similar for H:\n:neutral counting: H contributes 1 electron, the C contributes 1 electron (the other 3 electrons of C are for the other 3 hydrogens in the molecule): 1 + 1 \u00d7 1 = 2 valence electrons.\n:ionic counting: H contributes 0 electrons (H<sup>+</sup>), C<sup>4\u2212</sup> contributes 2 electrons (per H), 0 + 1 \u00d7 2 = 2 valence electrons\n:conclusion: Methane follows the octet-rule for carbon, and the duet rule for hydrogen, and hence is expected to be a stable molecule (as we see from daily life)\n\n*[[Hydrogen sulfide|H<sub>2</sub>S]], for the central S\n:neutral counting: S contributes 6 electrons, each hydrogen radical contributes one each: 6 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 8 valence electrons\n:ionic counting: S<sup>2\u2212</sup> contributes 8 electrons, each proton contributes 0: 8 + 2 \u00d7 0 = 8 valence electrons\n:conclusion: with an octet electron count (on sulfur), we can anticipate that H<sub>2</sub>S would be pseudotetrahedral if one considers the two lone pairs.\n\n*[[Sulfur dichloride|SCl<sub>2</sub>]], for the central S\n:neutral counting: S contributes 6 electrons, each chlorine radical contributes one each: 6 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 8 valence electrons\n:ionic counting: S<sup>2+</sup> contributes 4 electrons, each chloride anion contributes 2: 4 + 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 valence electrons\n:conclusion: see discussion for H<sub>2</sub>S above.

One might conclude that this molecule would be highly reactive - but the opposite is true: SF<sub>6</sub> is inert, and it is widely used in industry because of this property.\n\n* [[Titanium tetrachloride|TiCl<sub>4</sub>]], for the central Ti\n:neutral counting: Ti contributes 4 electrons, each chlorine radical contributes one each: 4 + 4 \u00d7 1 = 8 valence electrons\n:ionic counting: Ti<sup>4+</sup> contributes 0 electrons, each chloride anion contributes two each: 0 + 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 valence electrons\n:conclusion: Having only 8e (vs. [[Eighteen electron rule|18]] possible), we can anticipate that TiCl<sub>4</sub> will be a good Lewis acid.

Most of the 'fragments' mentioned above do '''not''' exist as such; they cannot be kept in a bottle: e.g. the neutral C, the tetraanionic C, the neutral Ti, and the tetracationic Ti are not ''free'' species, they are always bound to something, for neutral C, it is commonly found in graphite, charcoal, diamond (sharing electrons with the neighboring carbons), as for Ti which can be found as its metal (where it shares its electrons with neighboring Ti atoms), C<sup>4\u2212</sup> and Ti<sup>4+</sup> 'exist' only with appropriate counterions (with which they probably share electrons).

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally,\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega \\text{ (assuming equiprobable microstates)}.</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  Roughly twenty liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and atmospheric pressure]] has {{math|''N'' \u2248 {{val|6|e=23}}}} ([[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]).  At equilibrium, each of the {{math|\u03a9 \u2248 ''e''<sup>''N''</sup>}} configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely. \n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided  their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J&nbsp;K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22122</sup>&nbsp;K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]\u2014either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J&nbsp;K<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J&nbsp;K<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''. In other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the system is composed of very large numbers of constituents (atoms, molecules) and the state of the system is described by the average thermodynamic properties of those constituents; the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered, but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties, e.g. temperature, pressure, entropy, heat capacity. The early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium. The classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]]. Later, the thermodynamic properties, including entropy, were given an [[Statistical mechanics|alternative definition]] in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2014 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.). The statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics become an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state of a system that is subject to some process.\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ``Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_H-Q_C</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of [[energy]] arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_C}{T_H}\\right)Q_H</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_H-Q_C<\\left(1-\\frac{T_C}{T_H}\\right)Q_H</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_C>\\frac{T_C}{T_H}Q_H</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|<var>S<sub>i</sub></var>{{=}}<var>Q<sub>i</sub></var>/<var>T<sub>i</sub></var>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_H-S_C<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_H<S_C</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells require an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system. \n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nClausius coined the name ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) for {{mvar|S}} in 1865. He gives \"transformational content\" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" ({{lang|de|W\u00e4rme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of ''energy'', formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} \"work\" by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae]]}} \"transformation\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene f\u00fcr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant number which has since been known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=[Nachdr.]}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.  At a statistical mechanical level, this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Naim|first1=Arieh|title=On the So-Called Gibbs Paradox, and on the Real Paradox|journal=Entropy|date=21 September 2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=132\u2013136|doi=10.3390/e9030133|url=http://www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e9030132.pdf|bibcode=2007Entrp...9..132B}}</ref>\n\n== Second law of thermodynamics ==\n{{Main|Second law of thermodynamics}}\n{{See also|Thermodynamic Equilibrium| Non-equilibrium thermodynamics}} \nThe second law of thermodynamics requires that, in general, the total entropy of any system can't decrease other than by increasing the entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-19-280628-9}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''P'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: {{gaps|J|kg<sup>\u22121</sup>|K<sup>\u22121</sup>}}). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of {{gaps|J|mol<sup>\u22121</sup>|K<sup>\u22121</sup>}}.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{gaps|0|K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{gaps|298|K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{gaps|298|K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Defining the  entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state <math>X</math> is defined as the largest number <math>\\lambda</math>  such that <math>X</math> is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount <math>\\lambda</math> in the state <math>X_1</math> and a complementary amount, <math>(1-\\lambda)</math>, in the state <math>X_0</math>. A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.\n\n=== Entropy in quantum mechanics ===\n{{Main|von Neumann entropy}}\n\nIn [[quantum statistical mechanics]], the concept of entropy was developed by [[John von Neumann]] and is generally referred to as \"[[von Neumann entropy]]\",\n\n: <math>S = - k_\\mathrm{B}\\operatorname{Tr} ( \\rho \\log \\rho ) \\!</math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the [[density matrix]] and Tr is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] operator.\n\nThis upholds the [[correspondence principle]], because in the [[classical limit]], when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy,\n\n: <math>S = - k_\\mathrm{B}\\sum_i p_i \\, \\log \\, p_i,</math>\ni.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.\n\nVon Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik''. He provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of [[wave function collapse]] is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). Using this concept, in conjunction with the [[density matrix]] he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.\n\n=== Information theory ===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=I thought of calling it \"information\", but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it \"uncertainty\".

It was originally devised by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities ''p<sub>i</sub> so that\n:<math>H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \\log p(x_i).</math>\n\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25\u00b0C). The obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature.

As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main|Heat death of the universe}}\n\nSince a finite universe is an isolated system, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that its total entropy is continually increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in which all the [[energy]] ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.\n\nIf the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as [[Roger Penrose]] has pointed out \u2013 [[gravity]] plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into [[black hole]]s.

Recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general.

Nubra.jpg|thumb|\"Experts Expect the Unexpected.\" Roadsign in [[Nubra Valley]], northern [[Ladakh]], India.]]\n\nAn '''expert''' is someone who has a prolonged or intense experience through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a [[reliabilism|reliable]] source of [[wikt:technique|technique]] or [[skill]] whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by [[Peer group|peer]]s or the [[General public|public]] in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive [[knowledge]] or [[Aptitude|ability]] based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of [[credential]], [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]], to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may [[official]]ly (and [[expert witness|legally]]) rely upon the individual's [[opinion]]. Historically, an expert was referred to as a [[Wise old man|sage]] ([[Sage (Sophos)|Sophos]]). The individual was usually a profound [[Intellectual|thinker]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].\n\nIn specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].\n\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.<ref name='Ericsson1989'>{{Harv|Ericsson|Stasewski|1989}}</ref>\n\n==Expertise==\nExpertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert [[medical specialist]]s are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.\n\nThe word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.\n\n===Academic views===\nThere are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of [[communities of practice]]. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.\n\nIn the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\">{{Harv|Ericsson|Charness|Feltovich|Hoffman|2006}}</ref> deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the [[nature and nurture]] argument.<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\"/> Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Chassy|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Campitelli|2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of education there is a potential \"expert blind spot\" (see also [[Dunning\u2013Kruger effect]]) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the \"expert blind spot hypothesis\" researched by [[Mitchell J. Nathan|Mitchell Nathan]] and Andrew Petrosino (2003: 906). Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.\n\nThe blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices\u2019 cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts\u2019 and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko & Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, & Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\n{{sfn|Borko|Livingston|1989}}{{sfn|Nathan|Petrosino|2003}}\n\n===Historical views===\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of [[power (sociology)|power]]; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the [[printing press]] in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.\n\nPlato's \"[[Noble Lie]]\", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city \"the noble lie\" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.\n\nIn contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Intellectual|last=Fuller|first=Steve|publisher=Icon Books|year=2005|isbn=9781840467215|location=|pages=141}}</ref> However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries<ref name=\":0\" /> , despite not understanding it.\n\n===Related research===\nA number of computational models have been developed in [[cognitive science]] to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, [[Herbert A. Simon]] and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer).<ref>Simon and Gilmartin (1973)</ref> Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the [[CHREST|CHREST model]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Simon|2000}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|de Voogt|Retschitzki|2004}}</ref>\n\nAn important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on \"Skilled Memory and Expertise\" by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[James J. Staszewski]] confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\n\nWork on [[expert systems]] (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.\n\nIn a critique of the expert systems literature {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005}} suggest:\n<blockquote> If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. \u2026 No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.<ref>{{Harv|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005|p=788}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Skilled memory theory====\n<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\nThe role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.\n\nSkilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.\n\nThe first principle of skilled memory, the ''meaningful encoding principle,'' states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.\n\nThe second principle, the ''retrieval structure principle'' states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.\n\nThe third principle, the ''speed up principle'' states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.\n\nExamples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:\n* a '''waiter''' who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations (position of the person ordering). At the time of recall all items of a category (e.g., all salad dressings, then all meat temperatures, then all steak types, then all starch type) would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.\n* a '''running enthusiast''' who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer\u2014his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.\n* '''math enthusiasts''' who can in less than 25 seconds mentally solve 2 x 5 digit multiplication problems (e.g., 23 x 48,856) that have been presented orally by the researcher.\n\n====In problem solving====\nMuch of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (Chi, M. T. H., Glasser R., & Rees, E.,1982). Mathematics (Sweller, J., Mawer, R. F., & Ward, M. R., 1983) and physics (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.\n\nOne of the most cited works in this area, Chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).\n\nTheir findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts\u2019 schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices\u2019 schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.\n\n====Germain's scale====\nRelative to a specific field, an expert has:\n* Specific education, training, and knowledge\n* Required qualifications\n* Ability to assess importance in work-related situations\n* Capability to improve themselves\n* Intuition\n* Self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge\n\nMarie-Line Germain (Germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure (GEM). She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton (2001). Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.\n\n* This person has knowledge specific to a field of work.\n* This person shows they have the education necessary to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has the qualifications required to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has been trained in their area of expertise.\n* This person is ambitious about their work in the company.\n* This person can assess whether a work-related situation is important or not.\n* This person is capable of improving themselves.\n* This person is charismatic.\n* This person can deduce things from work-related situations easily.\n* This person is intuitive in the job.\n* This person is able to judge what things are important in their job.\n* This person has the drive to become what they are capable of becoming in their field.\n* This person is self-assured.\n* This person has self-confidence.\n* This person is outgoing.\n(Condensed from Germain, 2006).\n\n; References\n* Germain, M.-L.

Considered an appeal to ethos or \"the personal character of the speaker\",<ref>Aristotle. \"Rhetoric.\" Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon. New York: Modern Library, 2001. Print.</ref> established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience\u2019s judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.\n\nIn The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can \"possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people,\" attributed expertise is \"a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge.\" With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?<ref>Hartelius, E. Johanna. The Rhetoric of Expertise. Lanham: Lexington, 2011.

In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.<ref>Hartelus, E. Johanna. \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise.\" Southern Communication Journal 75.5 (2010). Web.</ref>\n\nHartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\">Hartelius, E. Johanna. (2011). Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise. Southern Communication Journal, Vol. 75, No. 5, Nov\u2013Dec 2010, pp. 505\u2013526.</ref> Drawing on a [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtinian framework]], Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius compares Wikipedia\u2019s methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin\u2019s theory of speech communication]], where genuine [[dialogue]] is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius acknowledges that [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[training]], [[skill]], and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia\u2019s dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges [[Encyclopedia|traditional encyclopedias]] and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia\u2019s use of [[hyperlink]]s to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia\u2019s way of knowing is dialogic.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the [[discourse community]].<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site\u2019s hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> By Wikipedia\u2019s hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site\u2019s [[Wikipedia:Community portal|community pages]], which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia\u2019s expert methodology.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/>\n\n===Networked Expertise===\n{{See also|Wisdom of the crowd}}\nBuilding on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a [[Many-to-many|\"many to many\"]] rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.<ref>Pfister, Damien. \"Networked Expertise in the Era of Many-to-many Communication: On Wikipedia and Invention.\" Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture, and Policy 25.3 (2011). Web.</ref>\n\n==Contrasts and comparisons==\n\n===Associated terms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nAn expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to ''be able to solve'' a [[problem]] and an expert has to ''know its solution''. The opposite of an expert is generally known as a [[layperson]], while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a [[technician]] and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of [[epistemology]] under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a [[wikt:generalist|generalist]] or [[polymath]].\n\nThe term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.\n\nIn contrast to an expert, a [[novice]] (known [[colloquially]] as a [[newbie]] or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.\n\n\"Expert\" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term \"[[authority]]\" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term \"authority\". Many sites and search engines such as Google and Technorati use the term \"authority\" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. However, this authority only measures populist information. It in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.\n\n===Developmental characteristics===\nSome characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include\n* A characterization of this practice as \"deliberate practice\", which forces the practitioner to come up with new ways to encourage and enable themselves to reach new levels of performance{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n* An early phase of learning which is characterized by enjoyment, excitement, and participation without outcome-related goals<ref>Janet L.

The Afghan government has long been pleading for foreign investment in order to grow and stabilize its economy.\n\n==Economic history==\n{{see also|Democratic Republic of Afghanistan#Economy}}\nAncient Afghanistan was one of the most prosperous countries in the world owing to its vibrant trade with Greater India that extended till Bangladesh and beyond.\n\nIn the early modern period under the rule of kings [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (1880\u20131901) and [[Habibullah Khan]] (1901\u20131919), a great deal of Afghan commerce was centrally controlled by the Afghan government. The Afghan monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and the country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the imposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodities and high taxes. This slowed the long-term development of Afghanistan during that period. Western technologies and manufacturing methods were slowly introduced during these eras at the command of the Afghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of the growing army. An emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and other military material. This process was in the hands of a small number of western experts invited to Kabul by the Afghan kings. Otherwise, it was not possible for outsiders, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale enterprises in Afghanistan during that period.<ref>Asian Affairs Journal, [http://www.bijanomrani.com/?p=Making_money_%20in_%20Afghanistan Making Money in Afghanistan: The First Western Entrepreneurs 1880-1919], Vol 3, 2012.</ref>\n\nThe first prominent plan to develop Afghanistan's economy in modern times was the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] project, modeled on the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in the [[United States]], which was expected to be of primary economic importance.<ref name=tudor>[https://archive.is/20121129092011/http://184.73.243.18:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/1803?show=full Report on Development of Helmand Valley, Afghanistan, 1956], Tudor Engineering Company</ref> The country began facing severe economic hardships during the 1970s when neighboring Pakistan, under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], began closing the Pakistan-Afghanistan [[border crossing]]s. This move resulted in Afghanistan increasing political and economic ties with its northern neighbor, the powerful [[Soviet Union]] of that time.\n\nThe 1979 [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] and ensuing [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] destroyed much of the country's limited infrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity. Eventually, Afghanistan went from a [[traditional economy]] to a centrally [[planned economy]] up until 2002 when it was replaced by a free market economy.<ref>http://www.unodc.org/pdf/publications/afg_opium_economy_www.pdf.</ref> Gross domestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of trade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. Continuing internal strife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide ways for the international community to help.\n\nAccording to the [[International Monetary Fund]], the Afghan economy grew 20% in the [[fiscal year]] ending in March 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12 months. The growth is attributed to international aid and to the end of [[drought]]s. An estimated $100 billion of aid entered the nation from 2002 to 2017. A GDP of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the IMF to $6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from [[opium]] products. Mean graduate pay was $0.56 per [[man-hour]] in 2010.\n\n==Agriculture and livestock==\n{{See also|Pomegranate production in Afghanistan|Opium production in Afghanistan}}\n[[File:A fruit vendor at the Kabul International AgFair-2009.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A fruit vendor at the [[Kabul]] International AgFair in 2009.]]\n[[File:Afghan pomegranate processing.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Workers processing [[pomegranate]]s (''anaar''), which [[Afghanistan]] is famous for in Asia.]]\n[[File:Tunnelerziehung Afghanistan 02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Afghan [[grape]]s]]\nThe Afghan economy has always been agricultural, despite the fact that only 12% of its total land is arable and about 6% is currently cultivated. [[Agriculture]] production is constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water. As of 2014, the country's annual [[fruit]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] exports is at $500 million. Afghanistan is known for producing some of the finest fruits and vegetables, especially [[pomegranate]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, and [[mulberries]]. Several provinces in the north of the country (i.e. [[Badghis Province|Badghis]] and [[Samangan Province|Samangan]]) are famous for [[pistachio]] cultivation but the area currently lacks proper marketing and processing plants. It is claimed that some Indian companies buy Afghan pistachios for a very low price, process them in [[India]] and sell to western countries as Indian products. However, the Afghan government is planning to build storage facilities for pistachios since receiving bumper crops in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/08/07/bumper-pistachio-crops-year-samangan |title=Bumper pistachio crops this year in Samangan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306083424/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/08/07/bumper-pistachio-crops-year-samangan |archivedate=March 6, 2014 |df= }}</ref> The [[Bamyan Province]] in central Afghanistan is known for growing superior [[potato]]es, which on an average produces 140,000 to 170,000 tonnes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/07/30/bamyan-farmers-eyeing-bumper-potato-yield |title=Bamyan farmers eyeing bumper potato yield |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306073325/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/07/30/bamyan-farmers-eyeing-bumper-potato-yield |archivedate=March 6, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[cereal]] production is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay.

Soviet efforts to disrupt production in resistance-dominated areas also contributed to this decline. Furthermore, since 2002 more than 4 million expats returned to Afghanistan. Many of these former refugees are now involved in the farming industry. Some studies indicate that agricultural production and livestock numbers may only be sufficient to feed about half of the country's population. Shortages are exacerbated by the country's limited transportation network, which is currently being rebuilt. A report by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) states that Afghanistan was nearing self-sufficiency in grain production.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2007/08/22/wheat-production-hits-record-high-takhar |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910105901/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2007/08/22/wheat-production-hits-record-high-takhar |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |title=Wheat production hits record high in Takhar |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-23 }}</ref>\n[[File:People of Bamyan-6.jpg|thumb|200px|Shrikant Jagtap (center), the senior agriculture adviser for the [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]], and his interpreter, Hamidullah, discuss agricultural programs with Sayed Khadin, a potato farmer, in front of one of his fields. [[Potato]]es have become the main cash crop for the province, contributing millions of dollars to its economy every year.]]\n\nThe availability of land suitable for grazing has traditionally made [[animal husbandry]] an important part of the economy. There are two main types of animal husbandry: sedentary, practiced by farmers who raise both animals and crops; and nomadic, practiced by animal herders known as [[Kuchi people|Kuchis]]. Natural pastures cover some {{convert|7500000|acre|km2}} but are being overgrazed. The northern regions around [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] and [[Maymanah]] were the home range for about six million [[Karakul (sheep)|karakul sheep]] in the late 1990s. Most flocks move to the highlands in the summer to pastures in the north. [[Oxen]] are the primary draft power and farmers often share animals for [[plowing]]. [[Poultry]] are traditionally kept in many houses, mostly in rural households.\n\nMuch of Afghanistan's livestock was removed from the country by early waves of refugees who fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 2001, the livestock population in Afghanistan had declined by about 40% since 1998. In 2002, this figure was estimated to have declined further to 60%. An FAO survey done in the northern regions in spring 2002 showed that in four provinces ([[Balkh Province|Balkh]], [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]], [[Sar-e Pol Province|Sar-e Pol]], and [[Faryab Province|Faryab]]), there was a loss of about 84% of [[cattle]] from 1997 to 2002 and around 80% of [[sheep]] and [[goat]]. The majority of Afghans traditionally raise sheep instead of goats because goat meat is not popular in Afghanistan. After 2002, the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation & Livestock (Afghanistan)|Afghan ministry of agriculture and livestock]] with assistance from [[USAID]] have been helping to regrow livestock numbers throughout the country. This was done by providing Afghan villagers training and animals to start with.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120708045431/http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Article.1131.aspx Chickens Improve Livelihoods]</ref> The [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Agriculture Minister]] [[Mohammad Asef Rahimi]] stated that over the past decade arable land had increased from 2.1 million hectares to 8.1 million hectares, wheat production from 5.1 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes, nurseries from 75,000 hectares to 119,000 hectares and grape production from 364,000 tonnes to 615,000 tonnes.

Significant stands of trees have been destroyed by the ravages of the war. Exploitation has been hampered by lack of power and access roads. Moreover, the distribution of the forest is uneven, and most of the remaining woodland is only found in the [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]] and the [[Paktia Province|Paktia]] regions in the east of the country.\n\nThe natural forests in Afghanistan are mainly of two types: dense forests of [[oak]] trees, [[walnut]] trees, and many other species of nuts that grow in the southeast, and on the northern and northeastern slopes of the [[Sulaiman range]]s; and sparsely distributed short trees and shrubs on all other slopes of the [[Hindu Kush]]. The dense forests of the southeast cover only 2.7% of the country. [[Roundwood]] production in 2003 was 3,148,000 cubic metres, with 44% used for [[fuel]].\n\nThe destruction of the forests to create agricultural land, [[logging]], [[forest fire]]s, plant diseases, and [[insect]] pests are all causes of the reduction in forest coverage. [[Illegal logging]] and clear-cutting by timber smugglers have exacerbated this destructive process. There is currently a ban on cutting new timber in Afghanistan. Prior to 2001 and under Taliban rule, massive deforestation of the country side was permitted and Afghans moved large quantities of logs into storage centers for profit, where the trees wait for processing on an individual tree by tree request.\n\n==Trade and industry==\n{{Further|Transport in Afghanistan|Mining in Afghanistan}}\n[[File:2006Afghan exports.PNG|thumb|350px|Afghan export destinations, 2006.]]\n[[File:Tree map export afghanistan all show 2009.jpeg|350px|thumb|A proportional representation of Afghan exports, 2009.]]\n[[File:Lapis Lazuli Route Agreement text finalized.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Officials of Afghanistan, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkmenistan]] signing the Lapis Lazuli Route agreement in 2016, which will create a new trade route from Afghanistan to the Caucusus and Turkey.]]\n[[File:Lapis Lazuli Route.png|thumb|left|200px|Map of the Lapis Lazuli Route]]\n[[File:Doost Marble Factory in Herat.jpg|thumb|Marble factory in [[Herat]].

During the 1980s, gas sales accounted for $300 million a year in export revenues (56% of the total). 90% of these exports went to the [[Soviet Union]] to pay for imports and debts. However, during the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, Afghanistan's natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage by the [[Mujahideen]]. Gas production has dropped from a high of 8.2 million cubic metres {{nowrap|(2.9 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cu ft)}} per day in the 1980s to a low of about 600,000 cubic meters {{nowrap|(2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> cu ft)}} in 2001.

Many of the goods that were smuggled into Pakistan have originally entered Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they fell under the 1965 [[Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement]]. This permitted goods bound for Afghanistan to transit through Pakistani seaports free of [[duty (economics)|duty]]. Once in Afghanistan, the goods were often immediately smuggled back into Pakistan over the porous border that the two countries share, often with the help of corrupt officials. Additionally, items declared as Afghanistan-bound were often prematurely offloaded from trucks and smuggled into Pakistani markets without paying requisite duty fees.<ref name=\"Siddiqui\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/29/afghan-pakistan-chamber-commerce-set |title=Afghan-Pakistan chamber of commerce set up |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051041/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/29/afghan-pakistan-chamber-commerce-set |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"pajhwok.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/12/05/pakistan-resolve-afghan-traders-problems |title=Pakistan to resolve Afghan traders' problems |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=December 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051053/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/12/05/pakistan-resolve-afghan-traders-problems |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}</ref> This resulted in the creation of a thriving [[black market]], with much of the illegal trading occurring openly, as was common in [[Peshawar]]'s bustling [[Karkhano Market]], which was widely regarded as a smuggler's bazaar.<ref>{{cite news|title=Peshawar Smuggling Boom|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/peshawar-smuggling-boom|accessdate=6 March 2016|agency=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|date=21 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn Pakistan clamped down in 2003 on the types of goods permitted duty-free transit, and introducing stringent measures and labels to prevent smuggling. re-routing of goods through Iran from the [[Persian Gulf]] increased significantly. The pre-2003 smuggling trade provided undocumented jobs to tens of thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis, but also helped fuel the ''black'' economy, often intertwined with the drug cartels, of both countries.\n\nIn 2010, Afghanistan and Pakistan signed into law a new [[Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement]] (APTTA), which allows their shipping [[truck]]s to transit goods within both nations. This revised US-sponsored APTTA agreement also allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to India via Pakistan up to the [[Wagah]] crossing point.<ref name=\"Siddiqui\"/><ref name=\"pajhwok.com\"/> Secondary to concerns regarding smuggling, Pakistani officials insisted that while Afghan exports destined for India can be transited across Pakistani territory, Indian goods cannot in turn be exported to Afghanistan across Pakistani territory. Instead, Afghan trucks offloaded at Wagah may return to Afghanistan loaded only with Pakistani, rather than Indian, goods in an attempt to curb smuggling.\n\nAccording to Afghanistan's Chamber of Commerce and Industries deputy head, Khan Jan Alokozai, about 500 [[intermodal container|shipping container]]s of trade goods enter Afghanistan via the [[Torkham]] and [[Wesh-Chaman border crossing]]s on a daily basis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/02/16/pakistan-waives-tax-afghan-trucks |title=Pakistan waives off tax on Afghan trucks |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910224315/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/02/16/pakistan-waives-tax-afghan-trucks |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}</ref> Other major trade routes in Afghanistan are via the crossing borders in [[Zaranj]], [[Islam Qala]], [[Hairatan]], [[Shir Khan Bandar]], and [[Towraghondi]].\n\n==Economic development and recovery==\n{{Further|Communications in Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends a trilateral Meeting in Iran.jpg|thumb|300px|Afghan President [[Ashraf Ghani]], Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], and Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]] at the signing of the [[Chabahar Port]] transit agreement.]]\n[[File:Khair Khana in 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|Shopping district in the [[Khair Kh\u0101na|Khair Khana]] neighborhood of Kabul.]]\nAfghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s.

Foreign Minister [[Zalmai Rassoul]] stated that his nation's \"goal is to achieve an Afghan economy whose growth is based on trade, private enterprise and investment\". Experts believe that this will revolutionize the economy of the region.\n\nThe capital of Kabul symbolizes the spirits of all Afghans and international cooperation, sets at the heart of this highly resourceful region, with great potential to turn into a business hub. After 2002, the new geo-political dynamics and its subsequent business opportunities, rapid urban population growth and emergence of high unemployment, triggered the planning of urban extension towards the immediate north of Kabul, in the form of a new city.\n\nIn 2006, former President [[Hamid Karzai]] established an independent board for the development of Kabul New City. The board brought together key stakeholders, including relevant government agencies, representation from private sector, urban specialists and economists, with cooperation from the government of [[Japan]] and French private sector, to prepare a master plan for the city in the context of Greater Kabul. The master plan and its implementation strategy for 2025 were endorsed by the Afghan Cabinet in early 2009.

In medieval [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them.<ref>For discussion of a previous formulation of this sentence, see {{harvp|\u00c1rmann Jakobsson|2015}}.</ref> However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.\n\nThe word ''elf'' is found throughout the [[Germanic languages]] and seems originally to have meant 'white being'. Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts, written by Christians, in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]], medieval German, and [[Old Norse]]. These associate elves variously with the gods of [[Norse mythology]], with causing illness, with magic, and with beauty and seduction.\n\nAfter the medieval period, the word ''elf'' tended to become less common throughout the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like ''zwerc'' (\"dwarf\") in German and ''huldra'' (\"hidden being\") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like ''fairy'' (borrowed from French into most of the Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the [[early modern period]], particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued to be associated with causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the [[British Isles]] and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters.\n\nWith urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word ''elf'' into the German language.\n\nFrom this Romanticist elite culture came the elves of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The \"[[Christmas elf|Christmas elves]]\" of contemporary popular culture are a relatively recent tradition, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the United States. Elves entered the twentieth-century [[high fantasy]] genre in the wake of works published by authors such as [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]]; these re-popularised the idea of elves as human-sized and human-like beings. Elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy books and games nowadays.\n\n==Relationship with reality==\n===Not objectively real===\nFrom a scientific viewpoint, elves are not considered [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively real]].<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 8-9.</ref>\n\nHowever, elves have in many times and places been [[belief|believed]] to be real beings. Where enough people have believed in the reality of elves that those beliefs then had real effects in the world, they can be understood as part of people's [[world view]], and as a [[social reality]]: a thing which, like the exchange-value of a dollar bill or the sense of pride stirred up by a national flag, is real because of people's beliefs rather than as an objective reality. Even in the twenty-first century, fantasy stories about elves have been argued both to reflect and shape their audiences' understanding of the real world,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poor|first=Nathaniel|date=September 2012|title=Digital Elves as a Racial Other in Video Games: Acknowledgment and Avoidance|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/7/5/375|journal=Games and Culture|doi=10.1177/1555412012454224|accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref>{{sfnp|Bergman|2011|pp=215-29}} and traditions about Santa Claus and his elves relate to the real-world [[economics of Christmas]].\n\nAccordingly, beliefs about elves and their social functions have varied over time and space. In the words of {{illm|\u00c1rmann Jakobsson|is}},\n<blockquote>the time has come to resist reviewing information about ''\u00e1lfar'' ''en masse'' and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of ''\u00e1lfar'' may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.<ref>{{harvp|Hall|2006|pp=230\u201331}}; cf. {{harvp|Shippey|2005}}; {{harvp|Hall|2007|pp=16\u201317}}; {{harvp|Gunnell|2007}}.</ref></blockquote>\nOver time, people have attempted to [[Demythologization|demythologise]] or [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalise]] beliefs in elves in various ways.\n\n=== Fitting elves into Christian cosmologies ===\n[[File:James I; Daemonologie, in forme of a dialogue. Title page. Wellcome M0014280.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Daemonologie'' by [[James VI and I]], which tried to explain traditional Scottish beliefs in terms of Christian scholarship.]]\nThere is no doubt that beliefs about elves have their origins before the [[conversion to Christianity]] and associated [[Christianization]] of north-west Europe. For this reason, belief in elves has, from the Middle Ages through into recent scholarship, often been labelled \"[[paganism|pagan]]\" and a \"[[superstition]]\". However, almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians (whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even twentieth-century fantasy authors). Attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of [[Germanic Christianity|Germanic-speakers' Christian culture]] and not merely relic of their [[Germanic religion (aboriginal)|pre-Christian religion]]. Accordingly, investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and [[Christian cosmology]] has been a preoccupation of scholarship about elves both in early times and in modern research.<ref>{{harvp|Jolly|1996}}; {{harvp|Shippey|2005}}; {{harvp|Green|2016}}.</ref>\n\nHistorically, people have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into Christian cosmology, all of which are found widely across time and space:\n\n* Identifying elves with the [[demon]]s of Judaeo-Christian-Mediterranean tradition.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Jolly|1992|p=172}}</ref> For example:\n** In English-language material: in the [[Royal Prayer Book]] from c. 900, ''elf'' appears as a ''gloss'' for \"Satan\".{{sfnp|Hall|2007|pp=71\u201372}} In the late-fourteenth-century ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath\u2019s Tale]]'', [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] equates male elves with [[incubus|incubi]] (demons which rape sleeping women).{{sfnp|Hall|2007|p=162}} In the [[Witch trials in early modern Scotland|early modern Scottish witchcraft trials]], witnesses' descriptions of encounters with elves were often interpreted by prosecutors as encounters with the [[Devil]].{{sfnp|Hall|2005b|pp=30\u201332}}\n** In medieval Scandinavia, [[Snorri Sturluson]] wrote in his ''[[Prose Edda]]'' of [[D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar and Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar|''lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar'' and ''d\u00f8kk\u00e1lfar'']] ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ''lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar'' living in the heavens and the ''d\u00f8kk\u00e1lfar'' under the earth.

Likewise, the early modern Scottish people who confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the [[Devil]]. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about [[Hulduf\u00f3lk|elves]] mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, that may or may not be Christian.{{sfnp|Shippey|2005|pp=161\u201368}}<ref name=alver&selberg/> It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to subvert the dominance of the Church.{{sfnp|Ingwersen|1995|pp=83\u201389}}\n* Integrating elves into Christian cosmology without identifying them as demons.<ref>e.g. Shippey (2005).</ref> The most striking examples are serious theological treatises: the Icelandic ''T\u00ed\u00f0fordrif'' (1644) by [[J\u00f3n Gu\u00f0mundsson l\u00e6r\u00f0i]] or, in Scotland, [[Robert Kirk (folklorist)|Robert Kirk]]'s ''Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies'' (1691).

Elves were certainly often seen as a cause of illness, and indeed the English word ''oaf'' seems to have originated as a form of the ''elf'': the word ''elf'' came to mean '[[changeling]] left by an elf' and then, because changelings were noted for their failure to thrive, to its modern sense 'a fool, a stupid person; a large, clumsy man or boy'.<ref>\"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/129456 oaf, n.1.]\", \"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/13053 auf(e, n.]\" , ''OED Online, Oxford University Press'', June 2018. Accessed 1 September 2018.</ref> However, it again seems unlikely that the origin of beliefs in elves itself is to be explained by people's encounters with objectively real people affected by disease.<ref>Hall 2007, 7-8.</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Phonological development of the word elf in English.png|thumb|right|upright=1.9|A chart showing how the sounds of the word ''elf'' have changed in the history of English.<ref>{{cite book|series=A Grammar of Old English|volume=1|title=Phonology|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1992}}</ref><ref>Hall (2007), p. 178 (fig. 7)</ref>]]\n\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:elf|elf]]'' is from the [[Old English]] word most often attested as ''\u00e6lf'' (whose plural would have been *''\u00e6lfe''). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form ''elf'' during the [[Middle English]] period.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 176\u201381.</ref> During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as ''\u00e6lfen'', putatively from common Germanic *''\u0251l\u03b2(i)innj\u014d''), but during the Middle English period the word ''elf'' came routinely to include female beings.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 75\u201388, 157\u201366.</ref>\n\nThe main medieval Germanic [[cognate]]s are Old Norse ''alfr'', plural ''alfar'', and Old High German ''alp'', plural ''alp\u00ee'', ''elp\u00ee'' (alongside the feminine ''elbe'').<ref>Hall (2007), p. 5.</ref> These words must come from [[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]], the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *''\u0251l\u03b2i-z'' and ''\u0251l\u03b2\u0251-z''.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 5, 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nGermanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/albiz|*\u0251l\u03b2i-z~*\u0251l\u03b2\u0251-z]]'' is generally agreed to be cognate with the Latin ''albus'' ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ''ailbh\u00edn'' ('flock'); Albanian ''elb'' ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic ''\u00e1lpt''. These all come from an Indo-European base ''*alb<sup>h</sup>-'', and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant \"white person\", perhaps as a euphemism. [[Jakob Grimm]] thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ''[[D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar and Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar|lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar]]'', suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called \"the white people\" because whiteness was associated with (specifically feminine) beauty.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\nA completely different etymology, making ''elf'' cognate with the ''[[Rbhus]]'', semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by [[Adalbert Kuhn|Kuhn]], in 1855.<ref name=\"Kuhn1855-p110\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=wvRTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA110 Kuhn (1855), p. 110]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=fV8SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA163 Schrader (1890), p. 163].</ref> In this case, *\u0251l\u03b2i-z connotes the meaning, \"skillful, inventive, clever\", and is cognate with Latin ''labor'', in the sense of \"creative work\". While often mentioned, this etymology is not widely accepted.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 54\u201355 fn. 1.</ref>\n\n=== Elves in proper names ===\n\nThroughout the medieval Germanic languages, ''elf'' was one of the nouns that was used in [[Germanic name|personal names]], almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] names beginning in ''Albio-'' such as ''[[Mars (mythology)#Celtic Mars|Albiorix]]''.<ref>Hall (2007), p. 56.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alden Valley - geograph.org.uk - 417197.jpg|thumb|Alden Valley, Lancashire, possibly a place once associated with elves]]\n\nPersonal names provide the only evidence for ''elf'' in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], which must have had the word *''albs'' (plural *''albeis''). The most famous name of this kind is ''[[Alboin]]''. Old English names in ''elf''- include the cognate of ''Alboin'' [[\u00c6lfwine]] (literally \"elf-friend\", m.), [[\u00c6lfric]] (\"elf-powerful\", m.), [[\u00c6lfweard]] (\"elf-guardian\", m.), and [[\u00c6lfwaru]] (\"elf-care\", f.). A widespread survivor of these in modern English is [[Alfred (name)|Alfred]] (Old English ''\u00c6lfr\u0113d'', \"elf-advice\"). Also surviving are the English surname [[Elgar]] (''\u00c6lfgar'', \"elf-spear\") and the name of [[St Alphege]] (''\u00c6lfh\u0113ah'', \"elf-high\").<ref>{{cite dictionary|last1=Reaney |first1=P.

These names suggest that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Of the many words for supernatural beings in Germanic languages, the only ones regularly used in personal names are ''elf'' and words denoting pagan gods, suggesting that elves were considered similar to gods.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 58\u201361.</ref>\n\nIn later Old Icelandic, ''alfr'' (\"elf\") and the personal name which in Common Germanic had been *''A\u00fea(l)wulfaz'' both coincidentally became ''\u00e1lfr~\u00c1lfr''.<ref name=devreis/>\n\nElves appear in some place-names, though it is hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, including personal names, can appear similar to ''elf''. The clearest English example is ''[[Elveden]]'' (\"elves' hill\", Suffolk); other examples may be ''[[Eldon Hill]]'' (\"Elves' hill\", Derbyshire); and ''[[Alden Valley]]'' (\"elves' valley\", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 64\u201366</ref>\n\n== Elves in medieval texts and post-medieval folk-belief ==\n=== Medieval English-language sources ===\n\n==== Elves as causes of illness ====\nThe earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves in any Germanic language are from [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. Medieval English evidence has, therefore, attracted quite extensive research and debate.{{sfnp|Jolly|1996}}{{sfnp|Shippey|2005}}{{sfnp|Hall|2007}}{{sfnp|Green|2016}} In Old English, elves are most often mentioned in medical texts which attest to the belief that elves might afflict humans and [[livestock]] with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. The most famous of the medical texts is the [[Anglo-Saxon Metrical Charms|metrical charm]] ''[[Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice]]'' (\"against a stabbing pain\"), from the tenth-century compilation ''[[Lacnunga]]'', but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century [[Bald's Leechbook|''Bald's Leechbook'' and ''Leechbook III'']].

In the twentieth century, scholars often labelled the illnesses elves caused as \"[[elf-shot]]\", but work from the 1990s onwards showed that the medieval evidence for elves being thought to cause illness in this way is slender;<ref>Hall (2007), 96\u2013118.</ref> debate about its significance is ongoing.{{sfnp|Tolley|2009|loc='''I''', p. 220}}\n\nThe noun ''elf-shot'' is actually first attested in a [[Scots language|Scots]] poem, \"Rowlis Cursing\", from around 1500, where \"elf schot\" is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken-thieves.{{sfnp|Hall|2005b|p=23}} The term may not always have denoted an actual projectile: ''shot'' could mean \"a sharp pain\" as well as \"projectile\". But in early modern Scotland ''elf-schot'' and other terms like ''elf-arrowhead'' are sometimes used of [[Elf-arrow|neolithic arrow-heads]], apparently thought to have been made by elves. In a few witchcraft trials people attest that these arrrow-heads were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged that witches (and perhaps elves) used them to injure people and cattle.{{sfnp|Hall| 2005b}} Compare with the following excerpt from a 1749\u201350 ode by [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]]:\n\n:''There every herd, by sad experience, knows''\n:''How, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly,''\n:''When the sick ewe her summer food forgoes,''\n:''Or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie.''<ref>{{harvp|Carlyle|1788}}, i 68, stanza II. 1749 date of composition is given on p. 63.</ref>\n\n==== Size, appearance, and sexuality ====\nBecause of elves' association with illness, in the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo-Saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illness with arrows. This was encouraged by the idea that \"elf-shot\" is depicted in the [[Eadwine Psalter]], in an image which became well known in this connection.<ref name=grattan&singer/> However, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons.<ref>{{harvp|Jolly|1998}}.</ref> Rather, recent scholarship suggests Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in Scandinavia or the Irish ''[[Aos S\u00ed]]'', were regarded as people.<ref>{{harvp|Shippey|2005|pp=168\u201376}}; Hall (2007), esp. pp. 172\u201375.</ref>\n\n[[File:Beowulf - ylfe.jpg|thumb|\"& ylfe\" (\"and elves\") in ''Beowulf'']]\nLike words for gods and men, the word ''elf'' is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not.{{sfnp|Hall|2007|pp=55\u201362}} Just as ''\u00e1lfar'' are associated with ''[[\u00c6sir]]'' in Old Norse, the Old English ''Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice'' associates elves with ''\u0113se''; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 35\u201363.</ref> In Old English, the plural ''ylfe'' (attested in ''Beowulf'') is grammatically an [[ethnonym]] (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as a people.<ref name=huld/><ref>Hall (2007), pp. 62\u201363; {{harvp|Tolley|2009|loc='''I''', p. 209}}</ref> As well as appearing in medical texts, the Old English word ''\u00e6lf'' and its feminine derivative ''\u00e6lbinne'' were used in [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to translate Latin words for [[nymph]]s. This fits well with the word ''\u00e6lfsc\u0233ne'', which meant \"elf-beautiful\" and is attested describing the seductively beautiful Biblical heroines [[Sarah]] and [[Book of Judith|Judith]].{{sfnp|Hall|2007|pp=75\u201395}}\n\nLikewise, in Middle English and early modern Scottish evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 157\u201366; {{harvp|Shippey|2005|pp=172\u201376}}.</ref> They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of [[fairy|fairies]] and particularly with the idea of a [[Fairy Queen]].

For a long time, views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, which talks about ''[[svart\u00e1lfar]]'', [[D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar and Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar|''d\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar'' and ''lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar'']] (\"black elves\", \"dark elves\", and \"light elves\"). However, these words are only attested in the Prose Edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]], [[demon]]s, and [[angel]]s, partly showing Snorri's \"paganisation\" of a Christian cosmology learned from the ''[[Elucidarius]]'', a popular digest of Christian thought.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nScholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the [[Elder Edda]]. The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is [[Wayland the Smith|V\u00f6lundr]], the protagonist of ''[[V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a]]''.{{sfnp|Dum\u00e9zil|1973|p=3}} However, elves are frequently mentioned in the [[Alliteration|alliterating]] phrase ''\u00c6sir ok \u00c1lfar'' ('\u00c6sir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic [[Oral-formulaic composition|formula]], indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the [[\u00c6sir]], or even suggesting that the elves and \u00c6sir were one and the same.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 34\u201339</ref>{{sfnp|Haukur \u00deorgeirsson|2011|pp=49\u201350}} The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem ''[[Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice]]''<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 35\u201363</ref> and in the Germanic personal name system;{{sfnp|Hall|2007|pp=55\u201362}} moreover, in [[Skaldic verse]] the word ''elf'' is used in the same way as words for gods.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 28\u201332.</ref> [[Sigvatr \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson]]\u2019s skaldic travelogue ''[[Austrfarav\u00edsur]]'', composed around 1020, mentions an ''[[\u00e1lfabl\u00f3t]]'' (\u2018elves' sacrifice\u2019) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 30\u201331.</ref> There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the \u00c6sir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the [[J\u00f6tunn|giants]].<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 31\u201334, 42, 47\u201353.</ref> Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.{{sfnp|Hall|2007|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nThere are hints that the god [[Freyr]] was associated with elves. In particular, ''[[\u00c1lfheimr]]'' (literally \"elf-world\") is mentioned as being given to [[Freyr]] in ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]''. Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the [[Vanir]]. However, the term ''Vanir'' is rare in Eddaic verse, very rare in Skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages. Given the link between Freyr and the elves, it has therefore long been suspected that ''\u00e1lfar'' and ''Vanir'' are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings.<ref name=simek2010/>{{sfnp|Hall|2007|pp=35\u201337}}<ref name=frog&roper/> However, this is not uniformly accepted.{{sfnp|Tolley|2009|loc='''I''', pp. 210\u201317}}\n\nA [[kenning]] (poetic metaphor) for the sun, ''[[\u00e1lfr\u00f6\u00f0ull]]'' (literally \"elf disc\"), is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between elves and the sun.<ref name=motz1973/>{{sfnp|Hall|2004|p=40}}\n\nAlthough the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that V\u00f6lundr is described as one of the elves in ''[[V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a]]''.<ref>{{harvp|\u00c1rmann Jakobsson|2006}}; Hall (2007), pp. 39\u201347.</ref> As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape [[B\u00f6\u00f0vildr]], the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by [[chivalric romance]] or [[Breton lai|Breton ''lais'']], ''K\u00f6tludraumur'' and ''[[Gullk\u00e1rslj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition.{{sfnp|Haukur \u00deorgeirsson|2011|pp=50-52}} Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the [[Bergen rune-charm]] from among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]].<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 133\u201334.</ref>\n\n==== Other sources ====\n[[File:Glasgow Botanic Gardens.

For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by ''Alpe''.<ref>Hall (2007), pp. 125\u201326.</ref> Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; [[Martin Luther]] believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.{{sfnp|Edwards|1994|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nAs in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. It seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves ({{lang-gmh|{{linktext|getwerc}}}}).<ref name=motz1983/> Thus, some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves.

These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse ''\u00e1lfr''. However, in the modern languages, traditional terms related to ''\u00e1lfr'' have tended to be replaced with other terms.

They left a circle where they had danced, which were called ''\u00e4lvdanser'' (elf dances) or ''\u00e4lvringar'' (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause [[venereal diseases]]. Typically, elf circles were [[fairy rings]] consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle. In the words of the local historian Anne Marie Hellstr\u00f6m:\n\n:<blockquote>...on lake shores, where the forest met the lake, you could find elf circles. They were round places where the grass had been flattened like a floor. Elves had danced there. By [[Tisnaren|Lake Tisnaren]], I have seen one of those. It could be dangerous and one could become ill if one had trodden over such a place or if one destroyed anything there.<ref name=\"He-1\" /></blockquote>\n\nIf a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.{{sfnp|Taylor|2014}}\n\nElves were not exclusively young and beautiful. In the Swedish folktale ''Little Rosa and Long Leda'', an elvish woman (''\u00e4lvakvinna'') arrives in the end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the ''subterraneans''.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Lilla Rosa och L\u00e5nga Leda|title=Svenska folksagor|year=1984|publisher=Almquist & Wiksell F\u00f6rlag AB|location=Stockholm|page=158}}</ref>\n\n==== In ballads ====\nElves have a prominent place in a number of closely related ballads which must have originated in the Middle Ages but are first attested in the early modern period.{{sfnp|Taylor|2014|pp=199-251}}  Many of these ballads are first attested in [[Karen Brahes Folio]], a Danish manuscript from the 1570s, but they circulated widely in Scandinavia and northern Britain. Because they were learned by heart, they sometimes mention elves, even though that term had become archaic in everyday usage. They have therefore played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post-medieval cultures. Some of the early modern ballads, indeed, are still quite widely known, whether through school syllabuses or modern folk music. They therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves from older traditional culture.{{sfnp|Taylor|2014|pp=264-66}}\n\nThe ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and human(-like) beings referred to in at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as [[Merman|mermen]], dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is ''[[Elveskud]]'' and its many variants (paralleled in English as ''[[Clerk Colvill]]''), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in ''Elveskud'', sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in ''[[Elveh\u00f8j]]'' (much the same story as ''Elveskud,'' but with a happy ending), ''[[Herr Magnus og Bj\u00e6rgtrolden]]'', ''[[Herr T\u00f8nne af Als\u00f8]]'', ''[[Ungersven och havsfrun|Herr B\u00f8smer i elvehjem]]'', or the Northern British ''[[Thomas the Rhymer]]''. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British ''[[Tam Lin]]'', ''[[The Elfin Knight]]'', and ''[[Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight]]'', in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian ''[[Harpans kraft]]''. In ''[[The Queen of Elfland's Nourice]]'', a woman is abducted to be a [[wet-nurse]] to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.{{sfnp|Taylor|2014|pp=199-251}}\n\n==== As causes of illness ====\n[[File:Alfkors.svg|thumb|The \"Elf cross\" which protected against malevolent elves.<ref name=\"alvkors\" />]]\nIn folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often play the role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating [[skin rash]]es, which were called ''\u00e4lvabl\u00e5st'' (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of [[bellows]] was most useful for this purpose). ''Sk\u00e5lgropar'', a particular kind of [[petroglyph]] (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as ''\u00e4lvkvarnar'' (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.<ref name=olrik/>\n\nIn order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (''Alfkors'', ''\u00c4lvkors'' or ''Ellakors''), which was carved into buildings or other objects.<ref name=\"alvkors\">The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfba/0313.html Alfkors]'' in ''Nordisk familjebok'' (1904).</ref> It existed in two shapes, one was a [[pentagram]] and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves.<ref name=\"alvkors\" /> The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate.<ref name=\"alvkors\" /> This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver.<ref name=\"alvkors\" /> In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.<ref name=\"alvkors\" />\n\n==== Modern continuations ====\nIn Iceland, expression of belief in the ''hulduf\u00f3lk'' (\"hidden people\"), elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common.

They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. In the analysis of [[Valdimar Tr. Hafstein]], \"narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture. The elves fend off, with more or less success, the attacks and advances of modern technology, palpable in the bulldozer\".<ref name=hafstein/> Elves are also prominent, in similar roles, in contemporary Icelandic literature.{{sfnp|Hall|2015}}\n\nFolk-stories told in the nineteenth century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic minorities in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.<ref name=tangherlini/>\n\n==Post-medieval elite and popular culture==\n\n=== Early modern elite culture ===\n[[File:Rackham elves.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]\nEarly modern Europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive [[High culture|elite culture]]: while the [[Reformation]] encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the [[Fetishization|fetishisation]] of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word ''elf, ''except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.{{sfnp|Taylor|2014}}\n\nElves entered early modern elite culture most clearly in the literature of Elizabethan England.{{sfnp|Bergman|2011|pp=62-74}} Here [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' (1590\u2013) used ''fairy'' and ''elf'' interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures. Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the ''Elfe'' and ''Elfin kynd'', claiming that they were created by [[Prometheus]].<ref>{{harvp|Keightley|1850|p=57}}</ref> Likewise, [[William Shakespeare]], in a speech in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1592) has an \"elf-lock\" (tangled hair) being caused [[Queen Mab]], who is referred to as \"the [[fairy|fairies']] [[midwife]]\".<ref name=\"oed-elf-lock\">{{Citation|title=elf-lock|url=http://www.oed.com/|year=1989|series=OED Online|work=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=26 November 2009|url-access=subscription}}; \"Rom. & Jul.

J. Tr\u00fcbner|year=1899|edition=6th improved and expanded|place=Strassbourg|page=93|authorlink=Friedrich Kluge}}</ref>\n\nAs [[German Romanticism]] got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore, Jacob Grimm rejected ''Elf'' as a recent Anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form ''Elb'' (plural ''Elbe'' or ''Elben'').<ref name=\"Grimm-eng443\" /><ref>[[#grimgrim18541954|Grimm &amp; Grimm (1854\u20131954)]], s.v. ''Elb''.</ref> In the same vein, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] translated the Danish ballad ''Elveskud'' in his 1778 collection of folk songs, ''{{lang|de|Stimmen der V\u00f6lker in Liedern}}'', as \"{{lang|de|Erlk\u00f6nigs Tochter}}\" (\"The Erl-king's Daughter\"; it appears that Herder introduced the term ''Erlk\u00f6nig'' into German through a mis-Germanisation of the Danish word for ''elf''). This in turn inspired Goethe's poem ''[[Der Erlk\u00f6nig]]''. Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the [[Erlking]], which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.{{sfnp|Taylor|2014|pp=119-135}}\n\nIn Scandinavia too, in the nineteenth century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. These are often called \"elves\" (''\u00e4lvor'' in modern Swedish, ''alfer'' in Danish, ''\u00e1lfar'' in Icelandic), although the more formal translation in Danish is ''feer''. Thus, the ''alf'' found in the fairy tale ''The Elf of the Rose'' by Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has \"wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet\". Yet Andersen also wrote about ''elvere'' in ''The Elfin Hill''. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the ''huldra'' in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.<ref name=erixon/>\n\nEnglish and German literary traditions both influenced the British [[Victorian era|Victorian]] image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with [[Pointy ears|pointed ears]] and stocking caps. An example is [[Andrew Lang]]'s fairy tale ''Princess Nobody'' (1884), illustrated by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]], where fairies are tiny people with [[butterfly]] wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example [[Enid Blyton]]'s [[The Faraway Tree]] series, and were influenced by German Romantic literature. Accordingly, in the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale ''[[The Elves and the Shoemaker|Die Wichtelm\u00e4nner]]'' (literally, \"the little men\"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though ''Wichtelm\u00e4nner'' are akin to beings such as [[kobolds]], [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] and [[brownie (folklore)|brownies]], the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as ''[[The Elves and the Shoemaker]]''. This shows how the meanings of ''elf'' had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the [[house-elf]] of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] stories. In his turn, J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form ''Elb'' in translations of his works, as recorded in his ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1967). ''Elb, Elben'' was consequently introduced in the 1972 [[German translation of The Lord of the Rings|German translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], repopularising the form in German.{{sfnp|Hall|2014}}\n\n=== Modern popular culture ===\n==== Christmas elf ====\n{{Main|Christmas elf}}\n[[File:ChristmasFest 2016 (30822904564).jpg|thumb|A person dressed as a Christmas Elf, Virginia 2016.]]\nWith industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated [[medievalism]].{{sfnp|Hall|2014}}\n\nAs American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem \"[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]\" (widely known as \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\") characterized St Nicholas himself as \"a right jolly old elf\".

The [[Elves (Middle-earth)|Elves of Middle-earth]] played a central role in [[Tolkien's legendarium]], notably ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in [[high fantasy]] works and in fantasy [[role-playing game]]s. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'') are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.{{sfnp|Bergman|2011}}\n\nIn works where elves are the main characters, such as ''The Silmarillion'' or Wendy and Richard Pini\u2019s comic book series ''[[Elfquest]]'', elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in ''The Lord of the Rings'', elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders.{{sfnp|Bergman|2011}} Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works continue to have a subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences.

It can be an extremely broad concept, though in everyday usage is often used more narrowly to denote profound [[wickedness]]. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal [[moral evil]] commonly associated with the word, or impersonal [[natural evil]] (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.</ref>\n\nEvil can denote profound [[immorality]]<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary Definition\">{{Cite web|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil}}</ref>, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the [[human condition]], where [[wikt:strife|strife]] and [[suffering]] (cf. [[Hinduism]]) are the true roots of evil.  In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary Definition\"/> As defined in [[philosophy]]{{fact|date=July 2018}} it can be the name for the [[psychology]] and [[instinct]] of individuals which [[selfish]]ly but often necessarily [[Defence mechanism|defends]] the personal boundary against deadly attacks and serious threats. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.<ref>Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, p. 32.</ref> Elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of evil involve [[Balance (metaphysics)|unbalanced]] behavior involving [[anger]], [[revenge]], [[fear]], [[hatred]], [[psychological trauma]], expediency, [[selfishness]], [[ignorance]], or [[neglect]].<ref>Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews.

While the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume an evildoer or doers.\n\nSome religions and philosophies deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|\u00dcbel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.\n\nThe root meaning of the word is of obscure origin though shown<ref>See 'Evil' entry in [[OED]]</ref> to be akin to modern [[German language|German]] ''[[:de:Das \u00dcbel|Das \u00dcbel]]'' (although ''evil'' is normally translated as ''Das B\u00f6se'') with the basic idea of [[transgression (disambiguation)|transgressing]].<ref name=\"Harper2001\">{{Cite web|author=Harper, Douglas |year=2001 |title=Etymology for evil |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=evil|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Chinese moral philosophy==\n:''Main: [[Confucius#Ethics|Confucian Ethics]], [[Confucianism]] and ''[[Taoism#Ethics|Taoist Ethics]]''\nAs with Buddhism, in [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]] there is no direct analogue to the way ''good and evil'' are opposed although reference to ''demonic influence'' is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Thus ''evil'' would correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the cardinal virtues of Taoism, compassion, moderation, and humility can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.<ref>[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W.

Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.<ref>Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness]: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.</ref>\n\nEven though the book may have had a sudden birth, its gestation period in Jung\u0092's unconscious was long. The subject of God, and what Jung saw as the dark side of God, was a lifelong preoccupation. An emotional and theoretical struggle with the core nature of deity is evident in Jung'\u0092s earliest fantasies and dreams, as well as in his complex relationships with his father (a traditional minister), his mother (who had a strong spiritual-mystical dimension), and the Christian church itself. Jung'\u0092s account of his childhood in his quasi-autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Vintage, 1963; henceforth MDR), provides deep, personal background about his early religious roots\u0096 and conflicts.\n\n=== Philip Zimbardo ===\nIn 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.<ref>[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website]</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n\n===Problem of evil and source===\n\nMost monotheistic religions posit that the singular God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely good.  The [[problem of evil]] asks how the apparent contradiction of these properties and the observed existence of evil in the world might be resolved.  Scholars have examined the question of suffering caused by and in both humans and animals, suffering caused by nature (like storms and disease). These religions tend to attribute the '''source of evil''' to something other than God, such as demonic beings or human disobedience.\n\nPolytheistic and non-theistic religions do not have such an apparent contradiction, but many seek to explain or identify the source of evil or suffering. These include concepts of evil as a necessary balancing or enabling force, a consequence of past deeds ([[karma]]), or as an illusion, possibly produced by ignorance or failure to achieve enlightenment.\n\nNon-religious atheism generally accepts evil acts as a feature of human actions arising from intelligent brains shaped by [[evolution]], and suffering from nature as a result of complex natural systems simply [[Naturalism (philosophy)|following physical laws]].\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith===\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept reflecting lack of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.<ref name=\"Coll. 1982\">{{cite book|last=Coll |first='Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |title=Some answered questions|year=1982|publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publ.

[[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:\n\n\"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind\u2014that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves.\"<ref name=\"Coll. 1982\"/>\n\nThus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.<ref name=\"Coll. 1982\"/>\n\n===Ancient Egyptian Religion===\nEvil in the religion of [[Ancient Egypt]] is known as [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], \"disorder/violence\". It is the opposite of [[Maat]], \"order\", and embodied by the serpent god [[Apep]], who routinely attempts to kill the [[sun god]] [[Ra]] and is stopped by nearly every other deity. Isfet is not a primordial force, but the consequence of free will and an individual's struggle against the non-existence embodied by Apep, as evidenced by the fact that it was born from Ra's umbilical cord instead of being recorded in the religion's creation myths.<ref>Kemboly, Mpay. 2010.

Late [[Heian period]] (12th-century Japan)]]\n:''Main: [[Buddhism#Buddhist ethics|Buddhist Ethics]]''\n\nThe primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] Charles Taliaferro, Paul J.

See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).\n\n\"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil.\" Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563\u2013483 BC.\n\n===Hinduism===\nIn Hinduism, the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Sikhism===\nIn adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. Once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of \"vices\" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}</ref> These are:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33\u201346}}</ref>\n* [[Moh]], or Attachment\n* [[Lobh]], or Greed\n* [[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath\n* [[Kaam]], or Lust\n* [[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism\nOne who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as \"[[Manmukh]]\", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue.

Much more the behavior of beings with free will, then they disobey God's orders, harming others or putting themselves over God or others, is considered to be evil.<ref>B. Silverstein ''Islam and Modernity in Turkey'' Springer 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-230-11703-7}} p. 124</ref> Evil doesn't necessarily refer to evil as an ontological or moral category, but often to harm or as the intention and consequence of an action, but also to unlawfull actions.<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02bc\u0101n'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335</ref>\nUnproductive actions or those who do not produce benefits are also thought of as evil.<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02bc\u0101n'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 338</ref> \n\nA typical understanding of evil is reflected by [[Al-Ash`ari]] founder of [[Ash\u02bfari|Asharism]]. Accordingly, qualifying something as evil depends on the circumstances of the observer. An event or an action itself is neutral, but it receives its qualification by God. Since God is omnipotent and nothing can exist outside of God's power, God's will determine, whether or not something is evil.<ref>P. Koslowski ''The Origin and the Overcoming of Evil and Suffering in the World Religions'' Springer Science & Business Media 2013 {{ISBN|978-9-401-59789-0}} page 37</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Satan#Judaism|label 1=Satan in Judaism}}\nIn [[Judaism]], evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. Human beings are responsible for their choices, and so have the [[Free will in theology#Judaism|free will]] to choose good (life in [[Jewish eschatology#\"The world to come\"|olam haba]]) or bad (death in heaven). ([[Deuteronomy]] 28:20) Judaism stresses obedience to God's [[mitzvah|613 commandments]] of the [[Written Torah]] (see also [[Tanakh]]) and the [[Halakha|collective body of Jewish religious laws]] expounded in the [[Oral Torah]] and [[Shulchan Aruch]] (see also [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]]). In Judaism, there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at the time of birth, since full responsibility comes with [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], when Jewish boys become 13, and girls become 12 years old.\n\n===Christianity===\n{{see also|Devil#Christianity|label 1=Devil in Christianity}}\nEvil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought, or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament. There is no moral action given in the Bible that is contrary to God's character or God's will.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Therefore, evil in a Christian worldview is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]\n\n[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises \"the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.\"<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.</ref> In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]] <ref>Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42\u201343.</ref> In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.<ref>Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.</ref> Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.<ref>Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.</ref> [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an \"unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in the experience that ''ought not to be''.\"<ref>Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.</ref>\n\nIn [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.\n\n[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Zoroastrianism===\nIn the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battleground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.\n\n==Question of a universal definition==\nA fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. The numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the United States\u2014along with many other countries\u2014practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.\n\n[[File:Don't Kid Yourself...it's Up to You.

Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil. Hitler considered it a moral duty to destroy Jews because he saw them as the root of all of Germany's ills and the violence associated with communism.<ref>https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007822</ref> [[Osama bin Laden]] found it moral to kill all Christians and Jews because he saw Islam as under attack by Western and US influence, accusing the US and Israel of forming a Crusader-Zionist alliance to destroy Islam, and considering US troops in Saudi Arabia infidels in the land of Islam's two holiest sites. He therefore considered non-Muslims and Shiite Muslims evil people intent on destroying Islamic purity and therefore heretic.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/08/afghanistan.terrorism15</ref>\n\nGiven his mixed record of efforts to give the Cuban people free-of-charge healthcare and education as well as opposing US hegemony in Latin America, while crushing all opposition and wrecking the Cuban economy, [[Fidel Castro]] saw himself as a Caribbean Robin Hood who considered the US and capitalism evil, while [[Cuban Americans]], Cuban dissidents, and other communism-bashing people saw Castro as the personification of evil in late 20th-century Cuban and Latin American history, viewing his Castroist ideology as just as evil as any other form of communism and bashing him for locking up dissidents and killing innocents by firing squads, while creating mayhem in the developing world by working to foment violent communist revolutions in the Americas and many African countries.<ref>https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/the-fidel-castro-myth-debunked-the-death-of-a-tyrant-not-a-hero/</ref><ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/fidel-castro-dead-latest-cuba-hero-tyrant-aged-90-a7440686.html</ref><ref>https://calvinchimes.org/2016/12/02/yes-fidel-castro-was-an-evil-man/</ref>\n\n==Philosophical questions==\n===Approaches===\n{{main article| Ethics}}\nViews on the nature of evil belong to the branch of philosophy known as [[ethics]] - which in modern philosophy is subsumed into three major areas of study:\n<ref name=\"iep.utm.edu\">''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ \"Ethics\"]</ref>\n# [[Meta-ethics]], that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. \n# [[Normative ethics]], investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. \n# [[Applied ethics]], concerned with the analysis of particular moral issues in private and public life.<ref name=\"iep.utm.edu\"/>\n\n===Usefulness as a term===\nOne school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment\u2014''punitive justice''\u2014punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} where the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.\n\nPsychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.\n\nAmerican psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.<ref name=\"Liemult\">Peck, M. Scott. (1983, 1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.</ref> The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Genghis Khan]] is considered by many people to be 'evil'.<ref>\"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/05/07/9-lessons-on-leadership-from-genghis-khan-yes-genghis-khan/ 9 Lessons on Power and Leadership from Genghis Khan]\".

By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.\n\n===Necessity===\n{{Main|Necessary evil}}\n[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]\n[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good.

On the other hand the matter of the epistle is wonderful, and quite equal to the Apostle's acknowledged writings: the truth of this would be admitted by anyone who has read the Apostle carefully... If I were asked my personal opinion, I would say that the matter is the Apostle's but the phraseology and construction are those of someone who remembered the Apostle's teaching and wrote his own interpretation of what his master had said. So if any church regards this epistle as Paul's, it should be commended for so doing, for the primitive Church had every justification for handing it down as his. Who wrote the epistle is known to God alone: the accounts that have reached us suggest that it was either Clement, who became Bishop of Rome, or Luke, who wrote the gospel and the Acts.\"<ref>A.

[[James the Just|James]] and [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Paul]] represent the moderates of each faction, respectively, and [[Saint Peter|Peter]] served as moderator.<ref>\"The Canon Debate\", McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, chapter 32, p. 577, by [[James D.

'' James the brother of Jesus and Paul, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in Gal 2, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage, which Paul lacked, and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared\".

Jesus, however, came as a mere man who was arrested by the Jewish leaders and who suffered and was [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] by the Romans. And although [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|he was seen resurrected]], he still [[Ascension of Christ|left the earth]] and his people, who now face persecution rather than victory. The Book of Hebrews solves this problem by arguing that the Hebrew Scriptures also foretold that the Messiah would be a priest (although of a different sort than the traditional Levitical priests) and Jesus came to fulfill this role, as a sacrificial offering to God, to atone for sins. [[Second Coming of Christ|His role of a king is yet to come]], and so those who follow him should be patient and not be surprised that they suffer for now.{{bibleref2c-nb|Hebrews|13:12\u201314|NIV}}\n\nSome scholars today believe the document was written to prevent [[apostasy]].<ref>See Whitlark, Jason, ''Enabling Fidelity to God: Perseverance in Hebrews in Light of the Reciprocity Systems of the Ancient Mediterranean World'' (PBMS; Carlisle: Paternoster Press, 2008).</ref> Some have interpreted apostasy to mean a number of different things, such as a group of Christians in one sect leaving for another more conservative sect, one of which the author disapproves. Some have seen apostasy as a move from the Christian assembly to pagan ritual. In light of a possibly Jewish-Christian audience, the apostasy in this sense may be in regard to Jewish-Christians leaving the Christian assembly to return to the Jewish [[synagogue]].

As A.C. Purdy summarized for ''The Interpreter's Bible'' (1955):\n<blockquote>\nWe may sum up our author\u2019s Christology negatively by saying that he has nothing to do with the older Hebrew messianic hopes of a coming Son of David, who would be a divinely empowered human leader to bring in the kingdom of God on earth; and that while he still employs the figure of a militant, apocalyptic king... who will come again..., this is not of the essence of his thought about Christ.\n\nPositively, our author presents Christ as divine in nature, and solves any possible objection to a divine being who participates in human experience, especially in the experience of death, by the priestly analogy. He seems quite unconscious of the logical difficulties of his position proceeding from the  that Christ is both divine and human, at least human in experience although hardly in nature.<ref>TIB XI p. 588''The Interpreter's Bible: '' The Holy Scriptures in the King James and Revised Standard versions with general articles and introduction, exegesis, [and] exposition for each book of the Bible in twelve volumes, [[George Arthur Buttrick]], Commentary Editor, Walter Russell Bowie, Associate Editor of Exposition, Paul Scherer, Associate Editor of Exposition, John Knox Associate Editor of New Testament Introduction and Exegesis, Samuel Terrien, Associate Editor of Old Testament Introduction and Exegesis, Nolan B.

While this theme of exaltation is asserted \u2018in many and various ways\u2019 we shall content ourselves by considering how the writer addresses this theme by asserting Jesus\u2019 superiority to a) angels, and b) Moses. The first chapter of Hebrews stresses the superiority of the Son to the angels. The very name \u2018Son\u2019 indicates superiority. This exaltation theme, in which the Son is contrasted with the angels (1:4), is expanded in the following string of OT quotations (1:5-13). While some have understood the catena as referring primarily to Christ\u2019s pre-existence, it is more likely that the verses should be understood, \u2018as a Christological hymn which traces the entire Christ event, including the pre-existence, earthly life, and exaltation of Christ\u2019. The overall structure of the catena seems to point to exaltation as the underlying motif... At least it may be concluded that the superiority of the Son is demonstrated by this comparison/contrast with angels.\n\nPeter Rhea Jones has reminded us that \u2018Moses is not merely one of the figures compared unfavourably to Jesus\u2019; but rather, \u2018Moses and Jesus are yoked throughout the entirety of the epistle\u2019. Allowing that Moses is much more than a \u2018whipping boy\u2019 for the author, the fact remains that the figure Moses is utilized as a basis for Christology. While there are several references to Moses, only two will be needed to demonstrate Jesus\u2019 superiority. The first passage to be considered is Hebrews 3:1-6. D\u2019Angelo and others regard the larger context of this passage (3:1-4:16) to be the superiority of Christ\u2019s message to the Law. While the comparison between Jesus and the angels is based on a number of OT citations, the comparison of Jesus and Moses turns on a single verse, Nu. 12:7. Like the angels (1:14), Moses was a servant who witnessed, as it were, to the Son. In other words, \u2018faithful Sonship is superior to faithful servantship\u2019. The Son is once again exalted. The exaltation theme finds expression in a more opaque way at 11:26. Here in the famous chapter on faith Moses is said to count \u2018abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt\u2019. The portrait of Moses drawn here is that of a martyr, and a Christian martyr at that. In effect, Moses joins that great cloud of witnesses who looked to Jesus as pioneer and perfecter of faith. Once again, Christ\u2019s superiority is asserted, this time over Moses and the entire Mosaic epoch.\n\nIn summary, the writer [of Hebrews] stressed the Sonship of Jesus and expressed it in a three-stage Christology of pre-existence, humanity, and exaltation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Mikeal |title=Son and High Priest: A Study in the Christology of Hebrews |journal=Evangelical Quarterly |date=1988 |issue=60 |pages=205-208 |url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/hebrews_parsons.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Sola fide]]''\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Epistle to the Hebrews]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Attridge, Harold W.

When she refuses to come, he deposes her and seeks a new queen through a sort of beauty pageant. Esther, an orphan daughter of a [[Benjamite]] named Abihail and under the protection of her cousin [[Mordecai]], who are members of the Jewish exile community in Persia, is chosen.  \n\nLater, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order.  Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try.  She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day.  During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews.  The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman.  Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther.  Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor.  Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods.  On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.<ref name=je>{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumbnail|File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|260px|Esther talking to Mordecai]]\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''[[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\n[[File:Esther denouncing Haman by Ernest Normand.png|thumb|Esther denouncing Haman by Ernest Normand.]]\n\n==Purim==\n{{Main article|Purim}}\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance.

For a time during the first half of the 20th century the entire genus ''Entamoeba'' was transferred to ''Endamoeba'', a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates about which little is known. This move was reversed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in the late 1950s, and ''Entamoeba'' has stayed 'stable' ever since.\n\n==Species==\nSeveral species are found in humans and animals.  ''Entamoeba histolytica'' is the pathogen responsible for invasive '[[amoebiasis]]' (which includes amoebic [[dysentery]] and [[amoebic liver abscess]]es). Others such as ''[[Entamoeba coli]]'' (not to be confused with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'') and ''[[Entamoeba dispar]]''<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamond LS, Clark CG|title=A redescription of Entamoeba histolytica Schaudinn, 1903 (emended Walker, 1911) separating it from Entamoeba dispar Brumpt, 1925 |journal=Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=340\u2013344 |year=1993  |pmid=8508172 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1993.tb04926.x}}</ref> are harmless.  With the exception of ''[[Entamoeba gingivalis]]'', which lives in the mouth, and  ''E. moshkovskii'', which is frequently isolated from river and lake sediments, all ''Entamoeba'' species are found in the [[intestine]]s of the animals they infect. ''[[Entamoeba invadens]]'' is a species that can cause a disease similar to ''E. histolytica'' but in reptiles.  In contrast to other species, ''E. invadens'' forms cysts in vitro in the absence of bacteria and is used as a model system to study this aspect of the life cycle. Many other species of ''Entamoeba'' have been described, and it is likely that many others remain to be found.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Parasite130116-1-olm Entamoeba gingivalis microscopy.tif|thumb|left|''Entamoeba gingivalis'']]\n\n''Entamoeba'' cells are small, with a single [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and typically a single [[Pseudopod#Morphology|lobose pseudopod]] taking the form of a clear anterior bulge. They have a simple life cycle. The trophozoite (feeding-dividing form) is approximately 10-20 \u03bcm in diameter and feeds primarily on bacteria. It divides by simple binary fission to form two smaller daughter cells.  Almost all species form cysts, the stage involved in transmission (the exception is ''[[Entamoeba gingivalis]]''). Depending on the species, these can have one, four or eight nuclei and are variable in size; these characteristics help in species identification.\n\n==Classification==\n''Entamoeba'' belongs to the [[Archamoebae]], which like many other anaerobic eukaryotes lack [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].  This group also includes ''[[Endolimax]]'' and ''Iodamoeba'', which also live in animal intestines and are similar in appearance to ''Entamoeba'', although this may partly be due to convergence.  Also in this group are the free-living amoebo-flagellates of the genus ''Mastigamoeba'' and related genera.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stensvold CR, Lebbad M, Clark CG |title=Last of the human protists: the phylogeny and genetic diversity of Iodamoeba. |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=  29|pmid= 21940643 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msr238 |issue=1 |date=January 2012 |pages=39\u201342|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/28327/1/28327.pdf }}</ref> Certain other genera of symbiotic amoebae, such as ''Endamoeba'', might prove to be synonyms of ''Entamoeba'' but this is still unclear.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Fission===\nStudying ''Entamoeba invadens'', [[David Biron]] of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] and coworkers found that about one third of the cells are unable to separate unaided and recruit a neighboring amoeba (dubbed the \"midwife\") to complete the fission.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Biron D, Libros P, Sagi D, Mirelman D, Moses E | title = Asexual reproduction: 'Midwives' assist dividing amoebae | year = 2001 | journal = Nature | pmid = 11260701 | volume = 410 | issue = 6827 | pages = 430 | doi = 10.1038/35068628 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6827/full/410430a0.html}}</ref> He writes:\n\n:''When an amoeba divides, the two daughter cells stay attached by a tubular tether which remains intact unless mechanically severed.  If called upon, the neighbouring amoeba midwife travels up to 200 \u03bcm towards the dividing amoeba, usually advancing in a straight trajectory with an average velocity of about 0.5 \u03bcm/s.  The midwife then proceeds to rupture the connection, after which all three amoebae move on.''\n\nThey also reported a similar behavior in ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]]''.<ref>Nagasaki, A and Uyeda, T., Q., P.; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cm.20311/abstract Chemotaxis-Mediated Scission Contributes to Efficient Cytokinesis in Dictyostelium], ''Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton''; Vol. 65; Issue 11; Article first published online: 7 AUG 2008</ref>\n\nSince ''E. histolytica'' does not form cysts in the absence of bacteria, ''E. invadens'' has become used as a model for encystation studies as it will form cysts under axenic growth conditions, which simplifies analysis. After inducing encystation in ''E. invadens'', DNA replication increases initially and then slows down. On completion of encystation, predominantly tetra-nucleate cysts are formed  along with some uni-, bi- and tri-nucleate cysts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh N, Bhattacharya S, Paul J | title = Entamoeba invadens: Dynamics of DNA synthesis during differentiation from trophozoite to cyst | year = 2010 | pages = 329\u201333 | issue = 2 | volume = 127 | journal = Experimental Parasitology | pmid = 20727884 | doi = 10.1016/j.exppara.2010.08.013  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WFH-50THXHF-1&_user=10&_coverDate=08%2F19%2F2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=08e7810e3e06a70584c575e1db73a78d&searchtype=a.html}}</ref>\n\n==Differentiation and cell biology==\n[[Uninucleate]]d trophozoites convert into cysts in a process called encystation. The number of nuclei in the cyst varies from 1 to 8 among species and is one of the characteristics used to tell species apart. Of the species already mentioned, ''Entamoeba coli'' forms cysts with 8 nuclei while the others form tetra-nucleated cysts. Since ''E. histolytica'' does not form cysts ''in vitro'' in the absence of bacteria, it is not possible to study the differentiation process in detail in that species. Instead the differentiation process is studied using ''E. invadens'', a reptilian parasite that causes a very similar disease to ''E. histolytica'' and which can be induced to encyst ''in vitro''. Until recently there was no genetic transfection vector available for this organism and detailed study at the cellular level was not possible. However, recently a transfection vector was developed and the transfection conditions for ''E. invadens'' were optimised which should enhance the research possibilities at the  molecular level of the differentiation process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Nishant |author2=Ojha, Sandeep |author3=Bhattacharya, Alok |author4=Bhattacharya, Sudha|title=Establishment of a transient transfection system and expression of firefly luciferase in ''Entamoeba invadens''|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|date=2012 |volume=183|issue=1|pages=90\u201393|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.01.003|pmid=22321531 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Nishant |author2=Ojha, Sandeep |author3=Bhattacharya, Alok |author4=Bhattacharya, Sudha|title=Stable transfection and continuous expression of heterologous genes in ''Entamoeba invadens''|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|date=2012 |volume=184|issue=1|pages=9\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.02.012|pmid=22426570 }}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis==\n\nIn sexually reproducing [[eukaryote]]s, [[homologous recombination]] (HR) ordinarily occurs during [[meiosis]].

They won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], when they hosted [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the finals]], and finished fourth in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. Since first entering in 1964, England have never won the [[UEFA European Championship]], with their best performances being a third place finish in [[UEFA Euro 1968#Third place play-off|1968]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], the latter as hosts.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n{{Recentism|section|date=January 2016}}\n}}\n{{Main|History of the England national football team}}\n[[File:England 1893.jpg|thumb|left|The England team before playing a match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at Richmond in 1893]]\nThe England national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. A [[England v Scotland representative matches (1870\u20131872)|representative match between England and Scotland]] was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]]. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872.\n\nThis match, played at [[Hamilton Crescent]] in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association.<ref>{{cite web |title=England Match No. 1&nbsp;\u2013 Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 30 November 1872&nbsp;\u2013 Match Summary and Report |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |publisher=englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref> Over the next forty years, England played exclusively with the other three [[Home Nations]]\u2014Scotland, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]\u2014in the [[British Home Championship]].\n\nAt first, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined [[FIFA]] in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] until [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], in which they were beaten in a [[England v United States (1950)|1\u20130 defeat]] by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7823072/England-v-USA-1950-World-Cup-win-over-the-Three-Lions-lives-long-in-the-memory.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Hart |title=England v USA: 1950 World Cup win over the Three Lions lives long in the memory |date=12 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nTheir first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a [[1949 England v Ireland football match|0\u20132 loss]] to the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], on 21 September 1949 at [[Goodison Park]].

The [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 win]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] after [[extra time]] in the final, during which [[Geoff Hurst]] famously scored a [[hat-trick]]. In [[UEFA Euro 1968]], the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nEngland qualified for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2\u20130 up, but were eventually beaten 3\u20132 after [[extra time]]. They failed in qualification for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], leading to Ramsey's dismissal, and [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] FIFA World Cups. Under [[Ron Greenwood]], they managed to qualify for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain (the first time competitively since 1962); despite not losing a game, they were eliminated in the second group stage.\n\nThe team under [[Bobby Robson]] fared better as England reached the quarter-finals of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], losing 2\u20131 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a game made famous by two goals by [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] for very contrasting reasons, before losing every match in [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. They next went on to achieve their second best result in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing fourth&nbsp;\u2013 losing again to West Germany in a semi-final finishing 1\u20131 after [[extra time]], then 3\u20134 in England's first [[Kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shoot-out]].\n\nDespite losing to Italy in the third place play-off, the members of the England team were given bronze medals identical to the Italians\u2019. The England team of 1990 were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets, for a spectacular open-top bus parade. However, the team did not win any matches in [[UEFA Euro 1992]], drawing with tournament winners Denmark, and later with France, before being eliminated by host nation [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].\n\nThe 1990s saw four England managers, each in the role for a relatively brief period. [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] was Robson's successor, but resigned after England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. At [[UEFA Euro 1996]], held in England, [[Terry Venables]] led England, equalling their best performance at a [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]], reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to Germany.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live |title =England v West Germany at Italia '90 \u2013 as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\t\n\nHe resigned following investigations into his financial activities.<ref>\"Venables is also the only England manager ever to resign from his post because of the muddy personal details set to be showcased in a high-profile trial related to financial irregularities.\" {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lg7k-Y5vF8kC&pg=PT855 |title=V is for Venables|publisher=[[When Saturday Comes]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> His successor, [[Glenn Hoddle]], similarly left the job for non-footballing reasons after just one international tournament&nbsp;\u2013 the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]&nbsp;\u2014 in which England were eliminated in the second round again by Argentina and again on penalties (after a 2\u20132 draw).

England lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and England rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but was terminated by them aftter the 2006 World Cup.\n\n[[Steve McClaren]] was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 was sacked on 22 November 2007.

The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.\n\nAlthough England's first [[away kit]]s were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]] in the semi-final of [[Euro 1996]] but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.\n\nEngland have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They had a kit similar to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973.

They initially used [[cricket]] grounds before later moving on to football clubs' stadiums. The original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] was built in [[Wembley]], London, for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].\n\nEngland played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a [[2000 England v Germany football match|defeat]].\n\nThis stadium was demolished during the period of 2002\u20132003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|2006 World Cup qualification]], this had largely settled down to having [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] stadium as the primary venue, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[St. James' Park, Newcastle|St. James' Park]] used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.\n\nThey returned to the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.\n\n===Media coverage===\nAll England matches are broadcast with full commentary on [[talkSPORT]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. From the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]] season until the 2017\u201318 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (often with the exception of [[STV (TV network)|STV]], the ITV franchisee in central and northern [[Scotland]]). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on [[Setanta Sports]] until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between \u00a34.99 and \u00a311.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000.<ref>{{cite news

for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup Finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside France and Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one [[FIFA World Cup]] title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 4\u20132 in the final. In [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished in fourth place, losing 2\u20131 to host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and, most recently, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, versus [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In 2010, England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]], in the Round of 16. This after drawing with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], and defeating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1\u20130, in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage]].\n\n{{Color box|gold|border=darkgray}} '''Champions'''&nbsp;&nbsp;{{Color box|silver|border=darkgray}} '''Runners-up'''&nbsp;&nbsp;{{Color box|#cc9966|border=darkgray}} '''Third place'''&nbsp;&nbsp;\n{{Color box|#9acdff|border=darkgray}} '''Fourth place'''&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=9|[[FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup record]]\n!

By 1890, the village consisted of about 100 homes.  According to the Eureka Chamber of Commerce, railroad workers while clearing way for the track and the next railroad camp saw Eureka, level land with little to clear, and declared, \"[[Eureka (word)|Eureka!]]\" Greek meaning \"I have found it.\" Thus, Eureka was founded.  In 1898, Eureka became home to the St. Louis Children's Industrial Farm, established to give children from St. Louis [[tenement]] neighborhoods a chance to experience life in a rural setting. It later became Camp Wyman (now part of [[Wyman Center]]) and is one of the oldest camps in the United States.  Eureka was incorporated as a fourth-class city on April 7, 1954.\n\n===City of Allenton===\nThe railroad town of Allenton is a former community on [[U.S. Route 66]] located (now) at the junction of [[Interstate 44]] and Business Loop 44 in western St. Louis County. In 1985, it was annexed by the city of Eureka. The town is currently rural, with adjacent farmland and forested [[Ozark]] ridges.

One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the [[ideal gas law]], which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.\n\nAnother common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including [[neutron star]]s, dense matter ([[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]s) and radiation fields. A related concept is the [[perfect fluid]] [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state used in cosmology]].\n\nEquations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.\n\nIn a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in [[process engineering]] problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the [[reservoir fluids]], and pipe sizing.\n\n{{Anchor|lasers2016-01-29}}Measurements of equation-of-state parameters, especially at high pressures, can be made using lasers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J.

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:\n\n:<math> pV = \\mathrm{constant}.\\,\\!</math> <!--this V doesn't have to be molar volume-->\n\nThe above relationship has also been attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]] and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.\n\n=== Charles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) ===\nIn 1787 the French physicist [[Jacques Charles]] found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}.</math>\n\n=== Dalton's law of partial pressures (1801) ===\n[[Dalton's Law]] of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:\n\n::<math>\np_\\text{total} = p_1+p_2+\\cdots+p_n = p_\\text{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i.\n</math>\n\n=== The ideal gas law (1834) ===\nIn 1834, [[\u00c9mile Clapeyron]] combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ''[[ideal gas law]]''. Initially, the law was formulated as ''pV<sub>m</sub>'' = ''R''(''T<sub>C</sub>'' + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0{{nbsp}}\u00b0C = 273.15{{nbsp}}K, giving:\n\n:<math>pV_m = R \\left(T_C + 273.15\\ {}^\\circ\\text{C}\\right).</math>\n\n=== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ===\nIn 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the first [[van der Waals equation|equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.<ref name=\"van der Waals\" >{{cite book |author1=van der Waals |author2=J. D. | title=On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States (doctoral dissertation) | publisher=Universiteit Leiden | year=1873}}</ref>  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich\u2013Kwong equation of state]] and the [[#Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong|Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]].\n\n== General form of an equation of state ==\nFor a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form\n\n:<math>f(p, V, T) = 0</math>\n\nAn equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although [[International System of Units|SI]] units are preferred. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Absolute temperature]] refers to use of the [[Kelvin]] (K) or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] (\u00b0R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.\n\n:<math>\\ p</math>, pressure (absolute)\n:<math>\\ V</math>, volume\n:<math>\\ n</math>, number of moles of a substance\n:<math>\\ V_m</math>, <math>\\frac{V}{n}</math>, '''[[molar volume]]''', the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid\n:<math>\\ T</math>, [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]\n:<math>\\ R</math>, [[gas constant|ideal gas constant]] \u2248 8.3144621{{nbsp}}J/mol\u00b7K\n:<math>\\ p_c</math>, pressure at the critical point\n:<math>\\ V_c</math>, molar volume at the critical point\n:<math>\\ T_c</math>, absolute temperature at the critical point\n\n== Classical ideal gas law ==\nThe classical [[ideal gas law]] may be written\n\n:<math>pV = nRT.</math>\n\nIn the form shown above, the equation of state is thus\n\n:<math>f(p, V, T) = pV - nRT = 0</math>.\n\nIf the [[Perfect gas|calorically perfect]] gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows\n\n:<math>p = \\rho(\\gamma - 1)e</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math>  is the density, <math>\\gamma = C_p/C_v</math> is the adiabatic index ([[heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]]), <math>e = C_v T</math> is the internal energy per unit mass (the \"specific internal energy\"), <math>C_v</math> is the specific heat at constant volume, and <math>C_p</math> is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\n== Cubic equations of state ==\nCubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a [[cubic function]] of V<sub>m</sub>.\n\n=== Van der Waals equation of state ===\nThe [[Van der Waals equation]] of state may be written:\n\n:<math>\\left(p + \\frac{a}{V_m^2}\\right)\\left(V_m - b\\right) = RT</math>\n\nwhere <math>V_m</math> is [[molar volume]]. The substance-specific constants <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> can be calculated from the [[critical properties]] <math>p_c, T_c</math> and <math>V_c</math> (noting that <math>V_c</math> is the molar volume at the critical point) as:\n:<math>a = 3p_c\\, V_c^2</math>\n:<math>b = \\frac{V_c}{3}.</math>\n\nAlso written as\n:<math>a = \\frac{27(R\\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}</math>\n:<math>b = \\frac{R\\,T_c}{8p_c}.</math>\n\nProposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation <math>a</math> is called the attraction parameter and <math>b</math> the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.\n\nThe van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, \"improved\" due to two independent reasons:\n# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus <math>V_m</math> cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (<math>V_m - b</math>) instead of <math>V_m</math>.\n# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (<math>p +</math> something) instead of <math>p</math>. To evaluate this \u2018something\u2019, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~<math>\\rho</math>, the force acting on the whole element is ~<math>\\rho^2</math>~<math>\\frac{1}{V_m^2}</math>.\n\nWith the reduced state variables, i.e. V<sub>r</sub>=V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>c</sub>, P<sub>r</sub>=P/P<sub>c</sub> and T<sub>r</sub>=T/T<sub>c</sub>, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:\n\n:<math>\\left(P_r + \\frac{3}{V_r^2}\\right)\\left(3V_r - 1\\right) = 8T_r</math>\n\nThe benefit of this form is that for given T<sub>r</sub> and P<sub>r</sub>, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]] for the reduced cubic form:\n\n:<math>V_r^3 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\\right)V_r^2 + \\frac{3V_r}{P_r} - \\frac{1}{P_r} = 0</math>\n\nFor P<sub>r</sub><1 and T<sub>r</sub><1, the system is in a state of vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.\n\n=== Redlich-Kwong equation of state ===\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  p &= \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m - b} - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}\\,V_m\\left(V_m + b\\right)} \\\\[3pt]\n  a &\\approx 0.42748\\frac{R^2\\,T_c^\\frac{5}{2}}{p_c} \\\\[3pt]\n  b &\\approx 0.08664\\frac{R\\,T_c}{p_c}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIntroduced in 1949, the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibria]]. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.\n\nThe Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the [[critical properties|critical pressure]] (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the [[critical properties|critical temperature]] (reduced temperature):\n\n:<math>\\frac{p}{p_c} < \\frac{T}{2T_c}.</math>\n\n=== Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong ===\n:<math>p = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_m-b} - \\frac{a\\,\\alpha}{V_m\\left(V_m+b\\right)}</math>\n\n:<math>a = \\frac{0.42747\\,R^2\\,T_c^2}{P_c}</math>\n:<math>b = \\frac{0.08664\\,R\\,T_c}{P_c}</math>\n:<math>\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\left(0.48508 + 1.55171\\,\\omega - 0.15613\\,\\omega^2\\right) \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2</math>\n\n:<math>T_r = \\frac{T}{T_c}</math>\n\nWhere \u03c9 is the [[acentric factor]] for the species.\n\nThis formulation for <math>\\alpha</math> is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\left(1 + \\left(0.480 + 1.574\\,\\omega - 0.176\\,\\omega^2\\right) \\left(1-T_r^{\\,0.5}\\right)\\right)^2</math>\n\nfor hydrogen:\n\n:<math>\\alpha = 1.202 \\exp\\left(-0.30288\\,T_r\\right).</math>\n\nWe can also write it in the polynomial form, with:\n\n:<math>A = \\frac{a\\,\\alpha\\,P}{R^2\\,T^2}</math> \n:<math>B = \\frac{b\\,P}{R\\,T}</math>\nthen we have:\n:<math>0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\\left(A-B-B^2\\right)-AB \\;</math>\nwhere <math>R</math> is the [[universal gas constant]] and Z=PV/(RT) is the [[compressibility factor]].\n\nIn 1972 G. Soave<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4|title = Equilibrium constants from a modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state| journal=Chemical Engineering Science| volume=27| issue=6| pages=1197\u20131203|year = 1972|last1 = Soave|first1 = Giorgio}}</ref> replaced the 1/{{radic|''T''}} term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function \u03b1(T,\u03c9) involving the temperature and the [[acentric factor]] (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The \u03b1 function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.\n\nNote especially that this replacement changes the definition of ''a'' slightly, as the <math>T_c</math> is now to the second power.\n\n=== Volume translation of Peneloux et alios ===\nThe SRK EOS may be written as\n:<math>p = \\frac{R\\,T}{V_{m,\\text{SRK}} - b} - \\frac{a}{V_{m,\\text{SRK}} \\left(V_{m,\\text{SRK}} + b\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    a &= a_c\\, \\alpha \\\\\n  a_c &\\approx 0.42747\\frac{R^2\\,T_c^2}{P_c} \\\\\n    b &\\approx 0.08664\\frac{R\\,T_c}{P_c}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.\n\nA downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume.

While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng\u2013Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.<ref name=\"PRSV1\" />  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.<ref name=\"PRSV2\" />\n\nOne thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.\n\n=== Elliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state ===\nThe Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990.<ref name=\"ESD\" >{{cite journal |author1=J.

This equation is also called the [[Kamerlingh Onnes]] equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the [[virial coefficient|coefficients]]. ''A'' is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient ''B'' corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, ''C'' to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', etc. are functions of temperature only.\n\nOne of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling<ref>{{Cite book |title=Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems |last=Starling |first=Kenneth E. |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |year=1973 |page=270}}</ref> shown next.

MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:\n\n: <math>\\frac{a(T, \\rho)}{RT} = \n  \\frac{a^o(T, \\rho) + a^r(T, \\rho)}{RT} =\n  \\alpha^o(\\tau, \\delta) + \\alpha^r(\\tau, \\delta)\n</math>\n\nwhere:\n: <math>\\tau = \\frac{T_r}{T}, \\delta = \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_r}</math>\n\nThe reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.\n\nOther thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.\n\n== Other equations of state of interest ==\n\n===Stiffened equation of state===\n\nWhen considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as [[Underwater explosion|underwater nuclear explosions]], [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|sonic shock lithotripsy]], and [[sonoluminescence]], the stiffened equation of state is often used:\n\n:<math>p = \\rho(\\gamma - 1)e - \\gamma p^0 \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>e</math> is the internal energy per unit mass, <math>\\gamma</math> is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and <math>p^0</math> is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).\n\nThe equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by <math>c^2 = \\gamma\\left(p + p^0\\right)/\\rho</math>.\n\nThus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is ''already'' under about 20,000 atmospheres (2&nbsp;GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100&nbsp;kPa to 200&nbsp;kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1&nbsp;MPa to 2000.2&nbsp;MPa).\n\nThis equation mispredicts the [[specific heat capacity]] of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.\n\n===Ultrarelativistic equation of state===\n\nAn [[ultrarelativistic fluid]] has equation of state\n\n:<math>p = \\rho_m c_s^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>p</math> is the pressure, <math>\\rho_m</math> is the mass density, and <math>c_s</math> is the [[speed of sound]].\n\n===Ideal Bose equation of state===\n\nThe equation of state for an ideal [[Bose gas]] is\n\n:<math>pV_m =\n  RT~\\frac{\\text{Li}_{\\alpha+1}(z)}{\\zeta(\\alpha)}\n  \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^\\alpha\n</math>\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, \u03b1 = 3/2), ''z'' is exp(''\u03bc''/''kT'') where ''\u03bc'' is the [[chemical potential]], Li is the [[polylogarithm]], \u03b6 is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and ''T''<sub>''c''</sub> is the critical temperature at which a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] begins to form.\n\n===Jones\u2013Wilkins\u2013Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)===\nThe '''equation of state from Jones\u2013Wilkins\u2013Lee''' is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.\n\n:<math>p = A \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega}{R_1 V} \\right) \\exp(-R_1 V) + B \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega}{R_2 V} \\right) \\exp\\left(-R_2 V\\right) + \\frac{\\omega e_0}{V}</math>\n\nThe ratio <math> V = \\rho_e / \\rho </math> is defined by using <math> \\rho_e </math> = density of the explosive (solid part) and <math> \\rho </math> = density of the detonation products.

Originally written c. 450\u2013200 BCE, it is also among the canonical [[Sapiential books|Wisdom Books]] in the [[Old Testament]] of most [[Christian denominations|denominations of Christianity]]. The title ''Ecclesiastes'' is a Latin [[transliteration]] of the Greek translation of the Hebrew '''Kohelet''', the [[pseudonym]] used by the author of the book.\n\nIn traditional Jewish texts, [[King Solomon]] is named as the author, although modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, who is not named anywhere in the book, or in the whole of the Bible, introduces a \"teacher\" whom he identifies as the son of David (ch1, v1). The author does not use his own \"voice\" throughout the book again until the final verses (ch12, v9\u201314), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises what \"the teacher\" has spoken.\n\nThe teacher discusses the [[meaning of life]] and the best way to live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently ''[[wikt:\u05d4\u05d1\u05dc|hevel]]'', meaning \"vain\" or \"futile\", (\"mere breath\"), as both the wise and the foolish end their lives in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: ''\"Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone\" (12:13).''\n\nEcclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by [[Abraham Lincoln]] addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist [[Thomas Wolfe]] wrote:\n{{quotation | \"[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth\u2014and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.\"{{sfn|Christianson|2007|p=70}} }}\n\n==Structure==\nEcclesiastes is presented as biography of \"Kohelet\" (or \"Qoheleth\", meaning \"Gatherer\", but traditionally translated as \"Teacher\" or \"Preacher\"{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}}). Kohelet's story is framed by voice of the narrator, who refers to Kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. Kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought. His journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete. The reader is not only to hear Kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}}\n\nFew of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to Ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvi}}\n* Title (1:1)\n* Initial poem (1:2\u201311)\n* I: Kohelet's investigation of life (1:12\u20136:9)\n* II: Kohelet's conclusions (6:10\u201311:6)\n** Introduction (6:10\u201312)\n** A: Man cannot discover what is good for him to do (7:1\u20138:17)\n** B: Man does not know what will come after him (9:1\u201311:6)\n* Concluding poem (11:7\u201312:8)\n* Epilogue (12:9\u201314)\nVerse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as \"the words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem.\"{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nMost, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9\u201314) as an addition by a later scribe. Some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of God's justice and the need for piety).{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvii}}\n\n==Summary==\nThe ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2\u201311 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow: Kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nAfter the introduction come the words of Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=946\u201357}}\n\nThe frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. The original ending of the book was probably the words: \"The end of the matter\" (12:13) but the text we have continues: \"Fear God\" (a phrase used often in Kohelet's speech) \"and keep his commandments\" (which he never uses), \"for God will bring every deed to judgement.\"{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=957\u201358}}\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Title, date and author===\nThe book takes its name from the Greek ''ekklesiastes'', a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: ''Kohelet'', meaning something like \"one who convenes or addresses an assembly\".{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|pp=124\u201325}} According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by [[Solomon]] in his old age.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=11}} (An alternative tradition that \"[[Hezekiah]] and his colleagues wrote [[Isaiah]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], the [[Song of Songs]] and Ecclesiastes\" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah.){{sfn|Smith|2007|p=692}} Nevertheless, critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=x}}{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=50\u201352}} The presence of [[Old Persian|Persian]] loan-words and [[Imperial Aramaic|Aramaisms]] points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE,{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when another Jewish writer, [[Ben Sira]], quotes from it.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiv}} The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] or the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of [[Hellenization]] (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450\u2013330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence;{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330\u2013180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nAlso unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person. Ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of Kohelet and first-person reflections on Kohelet\u2019s words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on Kohelet\u2019s parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. Some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of [[Uncle Remus]], although the description of the Teacher in 12:8\u201314 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} The question, however, has no theological importance,{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} and one scholar (Roland Murphy) has commented that Kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as \"one more example of the [[fatalism|futility of human effort]]\".{{sfn|Ingram|2006|p=45}}\n\n===Genre and setting===\nEcclesiastes has taken its literary form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}} It belongs to the category of [[wisdom literature]], the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings\u2014other examples include the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and some of the [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself.{{sfn|Brettler|2007|p=721}} Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the [[deuterocanonical]] works, [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Sirach]], both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.\n\nWisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Fox|2004|pp=x\u2013xi}} He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of [[Stoicism]], which held that all things are fated, and [[Epicureanism]], which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}\n\n===Canonicity===\nThe presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon\u2014a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people\u2014are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced then was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion, but other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Canon|date=1752|pages=601\u201304|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0000.566}}</ref> Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book which would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are, for example in the [[Book of Job]]. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. \"In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company,\" summarizes Martin A. Shields in his 2006 book ''The End of Wisdom: A Reappraisal of the Historical and Canonical Function of Ecclesiastes''{{sfn|Shields|2006|pp=1-5}}\n\n==Themes==\nScholars disagree about the themes of Ecclesiastes. Is it positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic?{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} Is Kohelet coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox? Is the ultimate message of the book to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors?{{sfn|Enns|2011|p=21}} At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he \"doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Doubt: A History|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-009795-0|location=New York|pages=75|quote=|via=}}</ref> Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., \"the dead are better off than the living\" (4:2) vs. \"a living dog is better off than a dead lion\" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11\u201312:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.{{sfn|Brown|2011|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe subjects of Ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. The phrase \"under the sun\" appears thirty times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in God, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=ix}} History and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent (\"Fear God\"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy God's gifts.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}\n\n==Judaism==\nIn Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read either on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (by Yemenites, Italians, some [[Sepharadim]], and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) or on the [[Shabbat]] of the Intermediate Days of [[Sukkot]] (by [[Ashkenazim]]). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of [[Sukkot]], even the Ashkenazim read it on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first [[Shabbat]] of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a reminder to not get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.\n\nThe final poem of Kohelet ({{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:1\u20138|HE}}) has been interpreted in the [[Targum]], Talmud and [[Midrash]], and by the rabbis [[Rashi]], [[Rashbam]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]], as an allegory of old age.\n\n==Catholicism==\nEcclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] leaders. For example, [[doctors of the Church]] have cited Ecclesiastes. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] cited Ecclesiastes in Book XX of ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.<ref>Augustine, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm The City of God, Book XX].

Accessed 2015-09-09.</ref>\n\nThe twentieth-century Catholic theologian and cardinal-elect [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] discusses Ecclesiastes in his work on theological aesthetics, ''The Glory of the Lord''. He describes Qoheleth as \"a [[transcendental idealism|critical transcendentalist]] ''avant la lettre''\", whose God is distant from the world, and whose ''[[kairos]]'' is a \"form of time which is itself empty of meaning\". For Balthasar, the role of Ecclesiastes in the Biblical canon is to represent the \"final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man\", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the Old Testament that paves the way for the advent of the New.<ref>{{cite book|last=von Balthasar|first=Hans Urs|title=The Glory of the Lord.

In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], he is also viewed as the 6th-century BCE author of the Book of Ezekiel, which reveals prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, the restoration to the land of Israel, and what some call the ''Millennial Temple'' (or [[Third Temple]]) visions.\n\nThe name Ezekiel means 'God strengthens'.\n\n== Life ==\nThe author of the Book of Ezekiel presents himself as Ezekiel, the son of Buzzi, born into a priestly ([[Kohen]]) lineage.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1:3|KJV|Ezekiel 1:3}}</ref> Apart from identifying himself, the author gives a date for the first divine encounter which he presents: \"in the thirtieth year\".<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|1:1\u20132|KJV|Ezekiel 1:1\u20132}}</ref> If this is a reference to Ezekiel's age at the time, he was born around 622 BCE, about the time of Josiah's reforms.<ref name=\"Betts2005\">{{cite book|author=Terry J.

However, Ezekiel and his contemporaries like [[Jeremiah]], another prophet who was living in Jerusalem at that time, witnessed the fulfillment of their prophecies with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Babylonians.  On the hypothesis that the \"thirtieth year\" of Ezekiel 1:1 refers to Ezekiel's age, Ezekiel was fifty years old when he had his final vision.<ref name=\"Betts2005\" /> On the basis of dates given in the Book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel's span of prophecies can be calculated to have occurred over the course of about 22 years.<ref name=\"Clements1996\">{{cite book|author=Ronald Ernest Clements|title=Ezekiel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cB5WoWI3FRAC&pg=PA1|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25272-4|page=1}}</ref> The last dated words of Ezekiel date to April 570 BCE.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Ezekiel|29:17|NIV|Ezekiel 29:17}}</ref><ref name=\"Eichrodt2003\">{{cite book|author=Walther Eichrodt|title=Ezekiel: A Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLN1BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA407|date=20 June 2003|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-1-61164-596-5|page=407}}</ref>\n\n== World views ==\n\n=== Jewish tradition ===\n[[File:Yad Vashem Memorial to survivors by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|240px|Monument to [[Holocaust survivors]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The quote is Ezekiel 37:14.]]\nEzekiel, like [[Jeremiah]], is said by [[Talmud]]<ref>(Meg. 14b)</ref> and [[Midrash]]<ref>([[Sifri]], Num. 78)</ref> to have been a descendant of [[Joshua]] by his marriage with the [[proselyte]] and former prostitute [[Rahab]].  Some statements found in rabbinic literature posit that Ezekiel was the son of Jeremiah, who was (also) called \"Buzi\" because he was despised by the Jews.<ref>Radak \u2013 R. David Kimkhi \u2013 in his commentary on Ezekiel 1:3, based on Targum Yerushalmi</ref>\n\nEzekiel was said to be already active as a prophet while in the Land of Israel, and he retained this gift when he was exiled with Jehoiachin and the nobles of the country to Babylon.<ref>([[Josephus]], ''Ant.'' x. 6, \u00a7 3: \"while he was still a boy\"; comp. Rashi on Sanh. 92b, above)</ref>\n\nRava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God ([[Merkabah]]), this is not because he had seen more than the prophet [[Isaiah]], but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar.<ref>(\u1e24ag. 13b)</ref> Ezekiel, like all the other prophets, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.<ref>Midrash Lev. Rabbah i. 14, toward the end</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[midrash]] ''[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah|Canticles Rabbah]]'', it was Ezekiel whom the three pious men, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (also called [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] in the Bible) asked for advice as to whether they should resist Nebuchadnezzar's command and choose death by fire rather than worship his [[idolatry|idol]]. At first God revealed to the prophet that they could not hope for a miraculous rescue; whereupon the prophet was greatly grieved, since these three men constituted the \"remnant of Judah\". But after they had left the house of the prophet, fully determined to sacrifice their lives to God, Ezekiel received this revelation: \"Thou dost believe indeed that I will abandon them. That shall not happen; but do thou let them carry out their intention according to their pious dictates, and tell them nothing\".<ref>(Midrash Canticles Rabbah vii. 8)</ref>\n\n=== Christianity ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Ezekiel-icon.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon]] of the Prophet Ezekiel holding a [[scroll]] with his prophecy and pointing to the \"closed gate\" (18th century, [[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], Russia)]]\n\nEzekiel is commemorated as a [[saint]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\u2014and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]]\u2014on July 23 (for those churches which use the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 23 falls on August 5 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]).<ref>Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America \u2013 [http://www.goarch.org/chapel/main_view?D=7/23/2014 Online Chapel: 23 July]</ref> Ezekiel is commemorated on August 28 on the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], and on April 10 in the [[Roman Martyrology]].\n\nCertain [[Lutheranism|Lutheran churches]] also celebrate his commemoration on July 20.\n\n[[Saint Bonaventure]] interpreted Ezekiel's statement about the \"closed gate\" as a prophecy of the Incarnation: the \"gate\" signifying the [[Virgin Mary]] and the \"prince\" referring to Jesus. This is one of the [[lection|readings]] at [[Vespers]] on [[Great Feasts]] of the [[Theotokos]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Catholic]] Churches.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This imagery is also found in the traditional Catholic Christmas hymn \"[[Gaudete]]\" and in a saying by Bonaventure, quoted by [[Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori]]: \"No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door.\"<ref>Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', Liguori, Mo.: Liguori Publications, 2000, p.&nbsp;623. {{ISBN|0-7648-0664-5}}.</ref> The imagery provides the basis for the concept that God gave Mary to humanity as the \"Gate of Heaven\" (thence the dedication of churches and convents to the Porta Coeli), an idea also laid out in the ''Salve Regina'' ([[Hail Holy Queen]]) prayer.\n\n=== Islamic tradition ===\n{{Main| Dhul-Kifl}}\nEzekiel is recognized as a [[prophet]] in [[Islamic]] [[tradition]]. Although not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] by the name, [[Muslim]] scholars, both classical{{efn|Ibn Kutayba, Ukasha, Tabari, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Ishaq, Masudi, Kisa'i, Balami, Thalabi and many more have all recognized Ezekiel as a prophet}} and modern{{efn|The greatest depth to the figure is given by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], in his commentary; his commentary's note '''2743''': \"If we accept \"Dhul al Kifl\" to be not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of \"Ezekiel\", it fits the context, Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about BCE 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb. He bore all with patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which are eternally true: \"Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken ...... etc. (Ezekiel, 34:2\u20134).\"}} have included Ezekiel in lists of the [[prophets of Islam]].\n\nThe Qur'an mentions a prophet called [[Dhul-Kifl|Zul-Kifl]]. This prophet is sometimes identified with Ezekiel although Zul-Kifl's identity is disputed. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], in his ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian'',<ref>''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian'' Copenhagen, 1778, ii. 264\u2013266</ref> says he visited [[Al Kifl]] in [[Iraq]], midway between [[Najaf]] and [[Hilla]] and said ''Kifl'' was the [[Arabic]] form of ''Ezekiel''. He further explained in his book that [[Ezekiel's Tomb]] was present in [[Al Kifl]] and that the Jews came to it on pilgrimage. The name ''Zul-Kifl'' would mean \"One of double\", as ''Zul'' in [[Arabic]] means \"the one of\" and \"kifl\" means \"double or folded\". Some Islamic scholars have likened Ezekiel's mission to the description of Dhul-Kifl. When the exile, monarchy, and state were annihilated, a political and national life was no longer possible. In the absence of a worldly foundation it became necessary to build a spiritual one and Ezekiel performed this mission by observing the signs of the time and deducing his doctrines from them. In conformity with the two parts of his book, his personality and his preaching are alike twofold, and the title ''Zul-Kifl'' means \"the one of double\" Aside from the possible identification of Zul-Kifl with Ezekiel, [[Muslim]]s have viewed Ezekiel as a prophet, regardless of his identification with Zul-Kifl. \nEzekiel appears in all [[Muslim]] collections of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]''.<ref>''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Ezekiel (Hizqil)''</ref> [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] further lists Ezekiel's father as [[Buzi]] (''Budhi'') and Ezekiel is given the title ''ibn al-adjus'', denoting \"son of the old (man)\", as his parents are supposed to have been very old when he was born. A tradition, which resembles that of [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] and [[Samuel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], states that Ezekiel's mother prayed to God in old age for the birth of an offspring and was given Ezekiel as a gift from [[God]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', G.

First published in the specification for the [[application binary interface]] (ABI) of the [[Unix]] operating system version named [[System V Release 4]] (SVR4),<ref>''[http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/gabi41.pdf System V Application Binary Interface]'' Edition 4.1 (1997-03-18)</ref> and later in the Tool Interface Standard,<ref name=\"linuxbase-elf\">Tool Interface Standard (TIS) ''[http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf Executable and Linking Format (ELF) Specification] Version 1.2'' (May 1995)</ref> it was quickly accepted among different vendors of [[Unix]] systems. In 1999, it was chosen as the standard binary file format for Unix and [[Unix-like]] systems on [[x86]] processors by the [[#86open|86open]] project.\n\nBy design, the ELF format is flexible, extensible, and [[cross-platform]]. For instance it supports different endiannesses and address sizes so it does not exclude any particular [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or [[instruction set architecture]]. This has allowed it to be adopted by many different [[operating system]]s on many different hardware [[Computing platform|platforms]].\n\n== File layout ==\n\nEach ELF file is made up of one ELF header, followed by file data. The data can include:\n* Program header table, describing zero or more [[Memory segmentation|memory segments]]\n* Section header table, describing zero or more sections\n* Data referred to by entries in the program header table or section header table\n\nThe segments contain information that is needed for [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] execution of the file, while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. Any [[byte]] in the entire file can be owned by one section at most, and orphan bytes can occur which are unowned by any section.\n\n{{quote box|\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"hexdump\" inline>\n00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"hexdump\" inline>\n00000010  02 00 3e 00 01 00 00 00  c5 48 40 00 00 00 00 00  |..>......H@.....|\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|Example hexdump of ELF file header<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#lexers-for-hexadecimal-dumps|title=Available lexers \u2014 Pygments|work=pygments.org}}</ref>}}\n\n=== File header ===\n\nThe ELF header defines whether to use [[32-bit|32-]] or [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] addresses.

The project was originally designated \"Spec 150\".\n\nThe format eventually chosen was ELF, specifically the Linux implementation of ELF, after it had turned out to be a [[De facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] supported by all involved vendors and operating systems.\n\nThe group began email discussions in 1997 and first met together at the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] offices on August 22, 1997.\n\nThe steering committee was [[Marc Ewing]], Dion Johnson, Evan Leibovitch, [[Bruce Perens]], Andrew Roach, Bryan Sparks and [[Linus Torvalds]].

Launched in 1958, [[Explorer 1]] was USA's first spacecraft to achieve orbit. Over\n90 space missions have been launched since. Starting with [[Explorer 6]], it has been operated by [[NASA]], with regular collaboration with a variety of other institutions, including many international partners.\n\nLaunchers for the Explorer program have included [[Jupiter C]] ([[Juno I]]), [[Juno II]], various [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]], [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] and [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] rockets, and [[Falcon 9]].\n\nCurrently, the program is divided into ''MIDEX'', ''SMEX'', and ''UNEX'', with select ''Missions of Opportunity'' operated with other agencies.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ignition of Jupiter-C with Explorer 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Explorer 1's Jupiter rocket ignites]]\n[[File:Sputnik 1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Sputnik'' caused an uproar in the West]]\nThe Explorers Program was the [[United States]]'s first successful attempt to launch an [[satellite|artificial satellite]]. It began as a [[U.S. Army]] proposal ([[Project Orbiter]]) to place a, \"civilian\", scientific satellite into [[orbit]] during the [[International Geophysical Year]]; however, that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S. Navy's [[Project Vanguard]], which included the first sub-orbital flight [[Vanguard TV0]]. in December 1956. The Explorers Program was later reestablished to catch up with the [[Soviet Union]] its launch of [[Sputnik 1]] on October 4, 1957 sparked the [[Sputnik crisis]]. [[Explorer 1]] was launched on January 31, 1958, becoming the first U.S. satellite, as well as discovering the [[Van Allen radiation belt]].\n\n[[File:M101 combined low.jpg|thumb|left|This artificially colored view of M101 maps ultraviolet light as blue while visible light is red since UV light does not have a \"color\" (the eye stopping at about violet). This view was taken by the Explorer SWIFT, which can also detect X-Rays, and has contributed to the study of Gamma-ray bursts and other topics]]\nAfter [[NASA]] was established in 1958, the Explorers Program was transferred from the US Army. NASA continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions, typically an artificial satellite with a specific science focus.  [[Explorer 6]] in 1959 was the first scientific satellite under the project direction of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.<ref>https://www.wired.com/2013/05/cometary-explorer-1973/</ref><ref>https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard-missions-past</ref> Over the following two decades, NASA has launched over 50 explorer missions, some in conjunction to military programs,  usually of an exploratory or survey nature or had specific objectives not requiring the capabilities of a major observatory.  Explorers satellites have made many important discoveries on: Earth's [[magnetosphere]] and the shape of its [[Gravitational field|gravity field]]; the [[solar wind]]; properties of [[micrometeoroids]] raining down on the Earth; ultraviolet, cosmic, and X-rays from the Solar System and universe beyond; [[Ionosphere|ionospheric physics]]; [[Solar flare|Solar plasma]]; [[solar energetic particles]]; and atmospheric physics. These missions have also investigated air density, radio astronomy, geodesy, and [[gamma ray astronomy]]. \n\nWith drops in NASA's budget, explorer missions became infrequent in early 1980s.  In 1988, the '''Small Explorer (SMEX)''' program was established with a focus on frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and relatively inexpensive space science missions in the disciplines of astrophysics and space physics.<ref name=NASAhistory>https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012v7ch4.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/pdf/106477main_smex.pdf</ref>  The first three SMEX missions were chosen in April 1989 out of 51 candidates, and launched in 1992, 1996 and 1998.<ref name=IEEE>{{cite conference |title=SAMPEX: NASA's First Small Explorer Satellite |conference=IEEE Aerospace Conference. 21\u201328 March 1998.

When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, [[electronic noise]] in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started.  The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] until very quickly it converges on a [[sine wave]] at a single frequency.\n\nFeedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />\n\n*In an ''[[RC oscillator]]'' circuit, the filter is a network of [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range.  Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the [[phase shift oscillator]] and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]].\n{{anchor|LC oscillator}}\n*In an ''LC oscillator'' circuit, the filter is a [[tuned circuit]] (often called a ''tank circuit''; the tuned circuit is a [[resonator]]) consisting of an [[inductor]] (L) and [[capacitor]] (C) connected together.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its [[resonant frequency]].  There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal.  LC oscillators are often used at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in [[signal generator]]s, tunable radio [[transmitter]]s and the [[local oscillator]]s in [[radio receiver]]s.  Typical LC oscillator circuits are the [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]], [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]]<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> and [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] circuits.\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|right|400px|Two common LC oscillator circuits, the Hartley and Colpitts oscillators]]\n*In a ''[[crystal oscillator]]'' circuit the filter is a [[piezoelectric]] crystal (commonly a [[quartz crystal]]).<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  The crystal mechanically vibrates as a [[resonator]], and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency.  Crystals have very high [[Q-factor]] and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so crystal oscillators have much better frequency stability than LC or RC oscillators.  Crystal oscillators are the most common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most [[radio transmitter]]s, and to generate the [[clock signal]] in computers and [[quartz clock]]s.  Crystal oscillators often use the same circuits as LC oscillators, with the crystal replacing the [[tuned circuit]];<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> the [[Pierce oscillator]] circuit is also commonly used.  Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30&nbsp;MHz or below.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />   Other types of resonator, [[dielectric resonator]]s and [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the [[microwave]] range.  For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in [[cell phone]]s.\n\n===Negative-resistance oscillator===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Negative resistance oscillator.svg\n| width1   = 190\n| image2   = Ganna gjenerators M31102-1.jpg\n| width2   = 162\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Typical block diagram of a negative resistance oscillator. In some types the negative resistance device is connected in parallel with the resonant circuit.  ''(right)'' A negative-resistance microwave oscillator consisting of a [[Gunn diode]] in a [[cavity resonator]].  The negative resistance of the diode excites microwave oscillations in the cavity, which radiate out the aperture into a [[waveguide]].\n}}\n\nIn addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using [[port (circuit theory)|one-port]] (two terminal) devices with [[negative resistance]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s.  Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the [[microwave]] range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.\n\nIn negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an [[LC circuit]], [[crystal oscillator|crystal]], or [[Resonator#Cavity resonators|cavity resonator]], is connected across a device with [[negative differential resistance]], and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy.  A resonant circuit by itself is \"almost\" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are [[Harmonic oscillator#Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] and decay to zero.  The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its [[resonant frequency]].\n\nThe negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying devices such as transistors and [[vacuum tube|tubes]] also have negative resistance.<ref name=\"Kung\">{{cite web\n | last = Kung\n | first = Fabian Wai Lee\n | title = Lesson 9: Oscillator Design\n | website = RF/Microwave Circuit Design\n | publisher = Prof. Kung's website, Multimedia University\n | year = 2009\n | url = http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | format = PDF\n | doi = \n | accessdate = October 17, 2012}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, pp. 9\u201310, 14</ref><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\">{{cite book\n | last = Ellinger\n | first = Frank\n | title = Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and Technologies, 2nd Ed\n | publisher = Springer\n | year = 2008\n | location = USA\n | pages = 391\u2013394\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0pl9xYD0QNMC&pg=PA391&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-3540693246}}</ref>  At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\">{{cite book\n | last =  R\u00e4is\u00e4nen\n | first = Antti V.\n | author2=Arto Lehto\n | title = Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications\n | publisher = Artech House\n | year = 2003\n | location = USA\n | pages = 180\u2013182\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Dgkvf84xoC&pg=PA181\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-1580535427}}</ref><ref name=\"Maas\" />  So high-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\" />\n\nSome of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 80%\"|Active devices used in oscillators and approximate maximum frequencies<ref name=\" Raisanen\" />\n|-\n!

The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.\n\nSquare-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the [[clock signal]] for [[sequential logic]] circuits such as timers and [[digital counter|counters]], although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability.  Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for [[cathode ray tube]]s in analogue [[oscilloscope]]s and [[television]] sets.  They are also used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), [[inverter]]s and [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]], [[dual-slope ADC|dual-slope analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), and in [[function generator]]s to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment.  In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.\n\n[[Ring oscillator]]s are built of a ring of active delay stages.  Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages.  Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.\n\nSome of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n*[[Multivibrator]]\n*[[Pearson\u2013Anson effect|Pearson\u2013Anson oscillator]]\n*[[Ring oscillator]]\n*[[Delay-line oscillator]]\n*[[Royer oscillator]]\n\n==Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)==\n{{Main|Voltage-controlled oscillator}}\nAn oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current.  These [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s are widely used in [[phase-locked loop]]s, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator.  These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in [[electronic filter|filters]], [[modulator]]s, [[demodulator]]s, and forming the basis of [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.\n\nRadio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a [[varactor]] diode to the [[tuned circuit]] or resonator in an oscillator circuit.  Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its [[capacitance]], which changes the [[resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit.  Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled [[current source]].  Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.\n\n==History==\nThe first practical oscillators were based on [[electric arc]]s, which were used for lighting in the 19th century.  The current through an [[arc lamp|arc light]] is unstable due to its [[negative resistance]], and often breaks into spontaneous oscillations, causing the arc to make hissing, humming or howling sounds<ref name=\"Hong\">{{Cite book |last=Hong |first=Sungook |title=Wireless: From Marconi's Black-Box to the Audion |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjXGQSPXvIcC&pg=PA165 |isbn=978-0262082983 |ref=harv}}, pp.&nbsp;161&ndash;165</ref> which had been noticed by [[Auguste Arthur de la Rive]] in 1846,<ref>https://archive.org/details/wirelesstelephon00ruhmrich</ref> and [[David Edward Hughes]] in 1878.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF00611436|title = The humming telephone as an acoustic maser|journal = Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume = 23|issue = 8|pages = 995\u20131010|year = 1991|last1 = Casperson|first1 = L.

The SE may transfer its registered office within the Community without dissolving the company in one member state in order to form a new one in another member state; however, such a transfer is subject to the provisions of 8 which require, inter alia, the drawing up of a transfer proposal, a report justifying the legal and economic aspects of the transfer and the issuing, by the competent authority in the member state in which the SE is registered, of a certificate attesting to the completion of the required acts and formalities.\n\n===Laws applicable===\nThe order of precedence of the laws applicable to the SE is clarified.\n\n===Registration and liquidation===\nThe registration and completion of the liquidation of an SE must be disclosed for information purposes in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Every SE must be registered in the State where it has its registered office, in a register designated by the law of that State.\n\n===Statutes===\nThe Statutes of the SE must provide as governing bodies the [[Shareholders' meeting|general meeting of shareholders]] and either a management board and a supervisory board (two-tier system) or an administrative board (single-tier system).\nUnder the two-tier system the SE is managed by a [[management board]]. The member or members of the management board have the power to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. They are appointed and removed by the [[supervisory board]]. No person may be a member of both the management board and the supervisory board of the same company at the same time. But the supervisory board may appoint one of its members to exercise the functions of a member of the management board in the event of absence through holidays. During such a period the function of the person concerned as a member of the supervisory board shall be suspended.\nUnder the single-tier system, the SE is managed by an [[administrative board]]. The member or members of the administrative board have the power to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. Under the single-tier system the administrative board may delegate the power of management to one or more of its members.\n\nThe following operations require the authorization of the supervisory board or the deliberation of the administrative board:\n* any investment project requiring an amount more than the percentage of [[subscribed capital]]\n* the conclusion of supply and performance contracts where the total turnover provided for therein is more than the percentage of turnover for the previous financial year\n* the raising or granting of loans, the issue of [[debt]] [[Security (finance)|securities]] and the assumption of liabilities of a third party or [[suretyship]] for a third party where the total [[money]] value in each case is more than the percentage of subscribed capital\n* the setting-up, acquisition, disposal or closing down of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses where the purchase price or disposal proceeds account for more than the percentage of subscribed capital\n* the percentage referred to above is to be determined by the Statutes of the SE. It may not be less than 5% nor more than 25%.\n\n===Annual accounts===\nThe SE must draw up annual accounts comprising the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, and the notes to the accounts, and an annual report giving a fair view of the company's business and of its position; consolidated accounts may also be required.\n\n===Taxation===\nIn tax matters, the SE is treated the same as any other multinational, i.e., it is subject to the tax regime of the national legislation applicable to the company and its subsidiaries. SEs are subject to taxes and charges in all member states where their administrative centres are situated. Thus, their tax status is not perfect as there is still no adequate harmonization at European level.\n\n===Winding-up===\nWinding-up, liquidation, insolvency, and suspension of payments are in large measure to be governed by national law. When an SE transfers its registered office outside the Community, or in any other manner no longer complies with requirements of article 7, the member state must take appropriate measures to ensure compliance or take necessary measures to ensure that the SE is liquidated.\n\n==Status of the legislation and implementation==\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R2157:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32001R2157 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE).\n\nCouncil Directive 2001/86/EC<ref name=\"europa2001\">{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0086:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32001L0086 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> of 8 October 2001 supplementing the Statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of employees.\n\nSee also: Europa's collection of press releases, regulations, directives and FAQs on the European Company Statute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/official/|title=EU directives and other official acts on company law|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025183640/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/official/|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nUK Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 2326.

In Germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect a certain percentage of seats on the supervisory board. Other member states, such as the UK, have no such requirement, and furthermore in these states such practices are largely unknown and considered a threat to the rights of management.\n\nThese differing traditions of worker involvement have held back the adoption of the Statute for over a decade. States without worker involvement provisions were afraid that the SE might lead to having such provisions being imposed on their companies; and states with those provisions were afraid they might lead to those provisions being circumvented.\n\nA compromise, contained in the Directive, was worked out as follows: worker involvement provisions in the SE will be decided upon by negotiations between employees and management before the creation of the SE. If agreement cannot be reached, provisions contained in the Directive will apply. The Directive provides for worker involvement in the SE if a minimum percentage of employees from the entities coming together to form the SE enjoyed worker involvement provisions. The Directive permits member states to not implement these default worker involvement provisions in their national law, but then an SE cannot be created in that member state if the provisions in the Directive would apply and negotiations between workers and management are unsuccessful.\n\n===Definition===\nDefinition of employee participation: it does not mean participation in day-to-day decisions, which are a matter for the management, but participation in the supervision and strategic development of the company.\n\n===Participation===\n* If the two parties do not reach a satisfactory arrangement, a set of standard principles set out in the Annex to the Directive becomes applicable.\n* Several models of participation are possible: firstly, a model in which the employees form part of the supervisory board or of the administrative board, as the case may be; secondly, a model in which the employees are represented by a separate body; and finally, other models to be agreed between the management or administrative boards of the founder companies and the employees or their representatives in those companies, the level of information and consultation being the same as in the case of the second model. The general meeting may not approve the formation of an SE unless one of the models of participation defined in the Directive has been chosen.\n* The employees' representatives must be provided with such financial and material resources and other facilities as enable them to perform their duties properly.\n* With regard to a European company formed through a merger, the standard principles relating to worker participation will apply where at least 25% of the employees had the right to participate in decisions before the merger. Here a political agreement proved impossible until the Nice summit in December 2000. The compromise adopted by the Heads of State or Governments allowed a member state not to apply the Directive to SEs formed from a merger, in which case the SE could not be registered in the member state in question unless an agreement had been concluded between the management and employees, or that no SE employee had the right of participation before the formation of the SE.\n\n===Employment contracts and pensions===\nEmployment contracts and pensions are not covered by the Directive. With regard to occupational pension schemes, the SE is covered by the provisions laid down in the proposal for a directive on institutions for occupational schemes, presented by the Commission in October 2000, in particular in connection with the possibility of introducing a single pension scheme for all their employees in the European Union.\n\n==Development==\nTwo approaches have been attempted to solve the problems cited above. One approach is to harmonize the company law of the member states. This approach has had some successes, but after thirty years only limited progress has been made. It is difficult to harmonize widely different regulatory systems, especially when they reflect different national attitudes to issues such as worker involvement in the management of the company.\n\nThe other approach is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat more effective than the harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish to ensure that the EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so that they will not be put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.\n\nThe European Company Statute represents a step in this direction, albeit a limited one. While it establishes some common EU rules on the SE, these rules are incomplete, and the holes in the rules are to be filled in using the law of the member state in which the SE is registered. This has been due to the difficulties of agreeing on common European rules on these issues.\n\n==Registrations==\nAs of 11 April 2018, 3,015 registrations have been made. In terms of registrations, the Czech Republic is vastly overrepresented, accounting for 79% of all ''societates Europaeae'' as of December 2015. 9 of the 50 constituents of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]] of leading [[Euro Area]] companies are as of December 2015 ''societates Europaeae''.\n\nAnnual registrations by member state are presented in the following chart:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecdb.worker-participation.eu/|title=ecdb.worker-participation.eu|website=ecdb.worker-participation.eu}}</ref>\n{{ #invoke:Chart | bar-chart\n| height = 250\n| width = 600\n| stack = 1\n| group 1 = 0 : 4 : 15 : 24 : 34 : 25 : 39 : 35 : 53 : 41 : 48 : 45\n| group 2 = 0 : 0 : 0 : 19 : 91 : 93 : 136 : 275 : 426 : 378 : 191 : 125\n| group 3 = 0 : 1 : 0 : 1 : 3 : 13 : 15 : 15 : 20 : 28 : 10 : 13\n| group 4 = 7 : 8 : 13 : 32 : 30 : 26 : 11 : 31 : 30 : 14 : 15 : 30\n| colors = red : yellow : blue : gray\n| group names = Germany : Czech Republic : Slovakia : Other member states\n| units suffix = Kg\n| x legends = 2004 : 2005 : 2006 : 2007 : 2008 : 2009 : 2010 : 2011 : 2012 : 2013 : 2014 : 2015\n}}\n{{Pie chart\n|caption=Sectors in which ''societates'' with more than five employees have been registered (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worker-participation.eu/European-Company-SE/Facts-Figures|title=Facts & Figures  / European Company (SE) / Home - WORKER PARTICIPATION.eu|first=|last=Cleverway|website=www.worker-participation.eu}}</ref>\n|label1=Financial services\n|value1=21\n|color1=#0084ff\n|label2=Services commerce\n|value2=18\n|color2=white\n|label3=Metal\n|value3=15\n|color3=#1abb45\n|label4=Chemical\n|value4=11\n|color4=#d00000\n|label5=Other services\n|value5=9\n|color5=yellow\n|label6=Information technology\n|value6=7\n|color6=pink\n|label7=Other\n|value7=5\n|color7=silver\n|label8=Construction industry\n|value8=5\n|color8=black\n|label9=Food, hotel and catering\n|value9=4\n|color9=orange\n|label10=Unknown\n|value10=3\n|color10=gray\n|label11=Transport\n|value11=2\n|color11=red}}\nRegistrations of new ''societates'' are to be published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]].

Additive mixers are also known as \"'''analog adders'''\" to distinguish from the related [[Adder (electronics)|digital adder circuits]].\n\nSimple additive mixers use [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] to add the currents of two or more signals together, and this terminology (\"mixer\") is only used in the realm of [[audio electronics]] where [[audio mixer]]s are used to add together [[Audio signal|audio signals]] such as [[Human voice|voice]] signals, [[music]] signals, and [[Sound effect|sound effects]].\n\nMultiplicative mixers multiply  together two time-varying input signals [[instantaneous]]ly (instant-by-instant).  If the two input signals are both [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s of specified [[Frequency|frequencies]] f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>, then the output of the mixer will contain two new sinusoids that have the sum f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> frequency and the difference frequency [[absolute value]] |f<sub>1</sub> -  f<sub>2</sub>|.\n\nNote: Any nonlinear electronic block driven by two signals with frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> would generate intermodulation (mixing) products. A multiplier (which is a nonlinear device) will generate ideally only the sum and difference frequencies, whereas an arbitrary nonlinear block would generate also signals at e.g. 2\u00b7f<sub>1</sub>-3\u00b7f<sub>2</sub>, etc. Therefore, normal nonlinear amplifiers or just single diodes have been used as mixers, instead of a more complex multiplier. A multiplier has usually the advantage of rejecting - at least partly - undesired higher-order intermodulations and larger conversion gain.\n\n==Additive mixers==\n{{see also|Mixing console}}\nAdditive mixers [[superposition principle|add two or more signals]], giving out a composite signal that contains the frequency components of each of the source signals.  The simplest additive mixers are simple resistor networks, and thus purely [[passivity (engineering)|passive]], while more complex [[matrix mixer]]s employ [[passivity (engineering)|active]] components such as [[buffer amplifier]]s for [[impedance matching]] and better isolation.\n\n==Multiplicative mixers==\n{{Main|Frequency mixer}}\n\nIdeal multiplicative mixers produce an output signal equal to the product of the two input signals. Multiplicative mixers are often used in conjunction with an [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] in the communications field to modulate signal frequencies. Multiplicative mixers can be coupled with a filter to either up-convert or down-convert an input signal frequency, but they are more commonly used to down-convert to a lower frequency to allow for simpler filter designs, as done in [[superheterodyne receiver]]s. In many typical circuits, the single output signal actually contains multiple waveforms, namely those at the sum and difference of the two input frequencies and harmonic waveforms. The output signal may be obtained by removing the other signal components with a filter. (''see'' [[intermediate frequency]])\n\n===Mathematical treatment===\nThe received signal can be represented as\n\n:<math>E_\\mathrm{sig} \\cos(\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}t+\\varphi)\\,</math>\n\nand that of the local oscillator can be represented as\n\n:<math>E_\\mathrm{LO} \\cos(\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}t).\\,</math>\n\nFor simplicity, assume that the output ''I'' of the detector is proportional to the square of the amplitude:\n:<math>I\\propto \\left( E_\\mathrm{sig}\\cos(\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}t+\\varphi) + E_\\mathrm{LO}\\cos(\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}t) \\right)^2</math>\n\n:<math> =\\frac{E_\\mathrm{sig}^2}{2}\\left( 1+\\cos(2\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}t+2\\varphi) \\right)</math>\n\n::<math> + \\frac{E_\\mathrm{LO}^2}{2}(1+\\cos(2\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}t)) </math>\n\n::<math> + E_\\mathrm{sig}E_\\mathrm{LO} \\left[\n\\cos((\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}+\\omega_\\mathrm{LO})t+\\varphi)\n+ \\cos((\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}-\\omega_\\mathrm{LO})t+\\varphi)\n\\right]\n</math>\n:<math> =\\underbrace{\\frac{E_\\mathrm{sig}^2+E_\\mathrm{LO}^2}{2}}_{constant\\;component}+\\underbrace{\\frac{E_\\mathrm{sig}^2}{2}\\cos(2\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}t+2\\varphi) + \\frac{E_\\mathrm{LO}^2}{2}\\cos(2\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}t) + E_\\mathrm{sig}E_\\mathrm{LO} \\cos((\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}+\\omega_\\mathrm{LO})t+\\varphi)}_{high\\;frequency\\;component}</math>\n\n::<math> + \\underbrace{E_\\mathrm{sig}E_\\mathrm{LO} \\cos((\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}-\\omega_\\mathrm{LO})t+\\varphi)}_{beat\\;component}.\n</math>\n\nThe output has high frequency (<math>2\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}</math>, <math>2\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}</math> and <math>\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}+\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}</math>) and constant components. In heterodyne detection, the high frequency components and usually the constant components are filtered out, leaving the intermediate (beat) frequency at <math>\\omega_\\mathrm{sig}-\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}</math>. The amplitude of this last component is proportional to the amplitude of the signal radiation. With appropriate [[signal analysis]] the phase of the signal can be recovered as well.\n\nIf <math>\\omega_\\mathrm{LO}</math> is equal to <math>\\omega_\\mathrm{sig} </math> then the beat component is a recovered version of the original signal, with the amplitude equal to the product of <math> E_\\mathrm{sig} </math> and <math>E_\\mathrm{LO} </math>; that is, the received signal is amplified by mixing with the local oscillator{{Clarify|reason=But at double the frequency?|date=October 2016}}. This is the basis for a [[Direct conversion receiver]].\n\n===Implementations===\nMultiplicative mixers have been implemented in a wide variety of ways. The most popular are [[Gilbert cell]] mixers, [[diode]] mixers, diode ring mixers ([[ring modulation]]) and switching mixers. Diode mixers take advantage of the non-linearity of diode devices to produce the desired multiplication in the squared term. It is a very inefficient method as most of the power output is in other unwanted terms which need filtering out. Inexpensive AM radios still use diode mixers.\n\nElectronic mixers are usually made with [[transistor]]s and/or [[diode]]s arranged in a [[balanced circuit]] or even a double-balanced circuit. These are readily manufactured by using the technology of either [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s or [[hybrid integrated circuit]]s. These are designed for a wide variety of [[frequency]] ranges, and they are [[Mass production|mass-produced]] to tight tolerances by the hundreds of thousands, making them relatively cheap components.\n\nThese double-balanced mixers are very widely used in [[microwave communication]] systems, [[satellite communication]] systems, and [[ultrahigh frequency]] (UHF) communications [[transmitter]]s and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]s, and in [[radar system]]s transmitters and receivers.\n\n''Gilbert cell'' mixers are just an arrangement of transistors that multiplies the two signals. The switching mixers (below) pass more power and usually insert less distortion.\n\n''switching mixers'' use arrays of [[field-effect transistor]]s or (in older days) [[vacuum tube]]s.  These are used as electronic switches, to permit the signal to go one direction, then the other. They are controlled by the signal being mixed. They are especially popular with digitally controlled radios.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Mixer}}\n[[Category:Analog circuits]]\n[[Category:Audio mixing]]\n\n[[da:Lydmikser]]\n[[ja:\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc]]\n[[pl:Mieszacz]]", "sha1": "p1rp442d0d02e6fim6eu62r8fhd4ifp"}}, {"title": "Eubulides", "ns": "0", "id": "9925", "revision": {"id": "854543189", "parentid": "854542755", "timestamp": "2018-08-12T03:42:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "Donner60", "id": "12744454"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/110.50.155.178|110.50.155.178]] ([[User talk:110.50.155.178|talk]]): unexplained content removal ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Eubulides''' ({{lang-el|\u0395\u1f51\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2}}; fl. 4th century BCE) of [[Miletus]] was a [[philosopher]] of the [[Megarian school]], and a pupil of [[Euclid of Megara]].

The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police pointed towards significant changes in ETA's structures in its later years. ETA divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA's intention was to disperse its members and reduce the impact of detentions.\n\nThe leading committee comprised 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation referred to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of ''Zuzendaritza Batzordea'' (directorial committee).

Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]] (MLNV) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates.

The GAL committed assassinations, kidnappings and torture, not only of ETA members but of civilians supposedly related to those, some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with ETA. 27 people were killed by GAL.<ref name=\"santamaria437\">{{cite book|author=[[Diego Carcedo]]|title=S\u00e1enz de Santa Mar\u00eda.

They were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.<ref name=\"santamaria437\"/>\n\nOne consequence of GAL's activities in France was the decision in 1984 by interior minister Pierre Joxe to permit the extradition of ETA suspects to Spain. Reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing ETA's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in France.<ref>''Talking to Terrorists: Making Peace in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country'' (pp. 197\u2013202), John Bew, Martyn Frampton, and Inigo Gurruchaga, Hurst & Co., London.</ref>\n\nThe airing of the state-sponsored \"dirty war\" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for GAL in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in Spain. The group's connections with the state were unveiled by the Spanish journal [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], with an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] series leading to the GAL plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. As a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed [[state terrorism]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/168958.stm Europe | Former Spanish ministers jailed for 'terrorism'].

Premier [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] was quoted as saying that the [[Rechtsstaat|constitutional state]] has to defend itself \"also in the sewers\" (''El Estado de derecho tambi\u00e9n se defiende en las cloacas'') something which, for some, indicated at least his knowledge of the scheme. However, his involvement with the GAL could never be proven.\n\nThese events marked the end of the armed \"counter-terrorist\" period in Spain and no major cases of foul play on the part of the Spanish government after 1987 (when GAL ceased to operate) have been proven in courts.\n\n====Human rights====\nAccording to the radical nationalist group, Euskal Memoria, between 1960 and 2010 there were 465 deaths in the Basque Country due to (primarily Spanish) \"state violence\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minutodigital.com/2011/02/28/los-etarras-escriben-su-historia-euskal-memoria/|title=Los etarras escriben su historia\u2026Euskal Memoria|work=Minuto digital|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> This figure is considerably higher than those given elsewhere, which are usually between 250 and 300.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gara.naiz.info/paperezkoa/20101107/230664/es/474-personas-han-muerto-represion-desde-1960|title=474 personas han muerto por la represin desde 1960 - GARA|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> Critics of ETA cite only  56 members of that organisation killed by state forces since 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-15-09-2003/abc/Nacional/cincuenta-y-seis-etarras-han-muerto-en-enfrentamientos-con-las-fuerzas-de-seguridad_207653.html|title=Cincuenta y seis etarras han muerto en enfrentamientos con las fuerzas de seguridad|work=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nETA members and supporters routinely claim [[torture]] at the hands of Spanish police forces.<ref name=\"publico\"/> While these claims are hard to verify, some convictions are based on confessions while prisoners are held ''incomunicado'' and without access to a lawyer of their choice, for a maximum of five days.

The horror caused then was so striking that ETA felt compelled to issue a communiqu\u00e9 stating that they had given warning of the Hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. The police claim that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.\n\nIn 1986 [[Gesto por la Paz]] (known in English as [[Association for Peace in the Basque Country]]) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the Basque Country the day after any violent killing, whether by ETA or by GAL. These were the first systematic demonstrations in the Basque Country against political violence. Also in 1986, in [[Ordizia]], ETA shot down [[Mar\u00eda Dolores Katarain]], known as \"Yoyes\", while she was walking with her infant son. Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of \"desertion\" because of her taking advantage of the Spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).\n\nOn 12 January 1988, all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated [[Batasuna|Herri Batasuna]] signed the [[Ajuria-Enea pact]] with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on 28 January, ETA announced a 60-day \"ceasefire\", later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the [[Mesa de Argel]] (\"[[Algiers]] Table\") took place between the ETA representative [[Eugenio Etxebeste]] (\"Antxon\"), and the then PSOE government of Spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.\n\nDuring this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as \"[[reinsertion]]\", under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the [[Salto del Negro]] prison in the [[Canary Islands]]. France has taken a similar approach.\n\nIn the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan \"''Euskal Presoak \u2013 Euskal Herrira''\" (''Basque prisoners to the Basque Country'', by \"Basque prisoners\" only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.\n\n[[File:EPPK 2008.jpg|thumb|Banner in support of imprisoned ETA members, by ''[[Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda|Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal)]]\n\n''[[Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda|Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal), later ''[[Askatasuna]]'' (\"Freedom\") and ''[[Senideak]]'' (\"The family members\") provided support for prisoners and families. The [[Basque Government]] and several Nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. The long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by Nationalist Prisoner's Family supporters.\n\nDuring the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in Africa.<!-- Is this Ceuta and Melilla? -->{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.\n\nAnother Spanish \"counter-terrorist\" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in [[Madrid]], due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held \"incommunicado\" for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court-appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the [[coroner]]s. In comparison, the [[habeas corpus]] term for other suspects is three days.\n\nIn 1992, ETA's three top leaders\u2014\"military\" leader [[Francisco Mujika Garmendia]] (\"Pakito\"), political leader [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Alvarez Santacristina]] (\"Txelis\") and logistical leader [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arregi Erostarbe]] (\"Fiti\"), often referred to collectively as the \"c\u00fapula\" of ETA or as the Artapalo collective<ref>[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/dn_16360.htm Informativos Telecinco.com \u2013 Internacional \u2013 Trece muertos y m\u00e1s de cincuenta heridos en dos atentados suicidas en Bangladesh].

Retrieved on 30 January 2011.</ref>\u2014were arrested in the northern Basque town of [[Bidart]], which led to changes in ETA's leadership and direction.\n\nAfter a two-month truce, ETA adopted even more radical positions. The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the \"''[[Y Groups]]''\", formed by young militants of ETA parallel groups (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]), dedicated to so-called \"''kale borroka''\"\u2014street struggle\u2014and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], garbage containers, and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the \"cupola\". ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.\n\nIn 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. The so-called \"Democratic Alternative\" replaced the earlier [[Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista|KAS]] Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish-government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to [[self-determination]] and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Changing the constitution was not considered.\n\nAlso in 1995 came a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]], a conservative politician who was leader of the then-opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in [[Majorca]] on the life of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]]. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. 10 July 1997, PP council member [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque town of [[Ermua]], with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping.\n\nThis demand was not met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of \"Assassins\" and \"Basques yes, ETA no\". This response came to be known as the \"Spirit of Ermua\".\n\nLater came acts of violence such as the 6 November 2001 car bomb in Madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on [[Association football|football]] stadiums and tourist destinations throughout Spain.\n\nThe [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the USA appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the worldwide toughening of \"anti-terrorist\" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. In addition, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement, ''Jarrai'', was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the \"political arm\" of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]).\n\nWith ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions have been frustrated by Spanish security forces.\n\nOn 24 December 2003, in San Sebasti\u00e1n and in [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in [[Chamart\u00edn Station]] in Madrid. On 1 March 2004, in a place between [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]] and [[Madrid]], a light truck with 536&nbsp;kg of explosives was discovered by the Guardia Civil.\n\nETA was initially blamed for the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 Madrid bombings]] by the outgoing government<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL16484708|title=ANALYSIS-Spain's PM down but not out after ETA bomb|first=Jason|last=Webb|date=16 January 2007|agency=Reuters  }}</ref> and large sections of the press.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/3505422.stm Europe | Spain papers point finger at Eta].

[[Extortion]] remains ETA's main source of funds.\n\n==Basque nationalist context==\nETA is considered to form part of what is informally known as the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]], a movement born much after ETA's creation. This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically akin, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term ''Ezker [[Abertzale]]a'' (Nationalist Left). Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party [[Batasuna]], the nationalist youth organization [[Segi (organization)|Segi]], the labour union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] (LAB), and [[Askatasuna]] among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.<ref name = \"jvjtfe\"/>\n\nThere are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: [[EAJ-PNV]], [[Eusko Alkartasuna]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and, in the [[French Basque country]], [[Abertzaleen Batasuna]]. In addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as [[United Left (Spain)|Ezker Batua]], [[Batzarre]] and some sectors of the [[EAJ-PNV]] party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.\n\n==French role==\nHistorically, members of ETA have taken refuge in France, particularly the [[French Basque Country]]. The leadership have typically chosen to live in France for security reasons, where police pressure is much less than in Spain.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1386545/Payback-for-Eta-in-the-Pays-Basque.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Payback for Eta in the Pays Basque|first=Isambard|last=Wilkinson|date=2 March 2002|access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Accordingly, ETA's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the French Basque country so as to get French acquiescence for their activities. The [[French government]] quietly tolerated the group, especially during [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]], when ETA members could face the death penalty in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|GAL]] still hindered [[counter-terrorist]] cooperation between France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base of operations.<ref>[http://www.france24.com/en/20080926-spain-basque-separatism-batasuna-eta Spain looks to France for help against Basque separatists].

Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA \u2013including their successive \"military\", \"political\" or finances chiefs \u2013 have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.\n\nIn response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors. This implied a change from the group's previous low-profile in the French Basque Country, which successive ETA leaders had used to discreetly manage their activities in Spain.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/>\n\n==Government response==\nETA considers its prisoners [[political prisoner]]s.

Before that date, those who did so were menaced and expelled from the group. Some were assassinated by ETA for leaving the group and going through reinsertion programs.<ref name = \"hizrqw\"/>\n\nThe Spanish Government passed the ''Ley de Partidos Pol\u00edticos''.

This procedure started in 1998 with the preventive closure of the newspaper ''[[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]]'' (and its associated radio-station ''Egin Irratia''), accused of being linked to ETA, and temporary imprisoning the editor of its \"investigative unit\", [[Pepe Rei]], under similar accusations. In August 1999 Judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]] authorized the reopening of the newspaper and the radio, but they could not reopen due to economic difficulties.\n\nJudicial procedure 18/98 has many ramifications, including the following:\n\n* A trial against a little-known organization called ''[[Xaki]]'', acquitted in 2001 as the \"international network\" of ETA.\n* A trial against the youths' movement ''[[Jarrai]]''-''Haika''-''Segi'', accused of contributing to street violence in an organized form and in connivance with ETA.\n* Another trial against [[Pepe Rei]] and his new investigation magazine ''Ardi Beltza'' (''Black Sheep'').

The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called [[nuclear pore]]s that perforate the nuclear envelope. These pores are about 120 [[Nanometre|nm]] in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some to pass through the membrane, but not others.<ref name=Cooper>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Nuclear%20Envelope&rid=cooper.section.1323#1324|title=The Nuclear Envelope and Traffic between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|year=2000|work= The Cell: A Molecular Approach|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc}}</ref> Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they play an important role in the [[physiology]] of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the [[perinuclear space]] and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.\n\nThe nuclear envelope's structure is determined by a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the [[nuclear lamina]], which binds to [[chromatin]], integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus. The nuclear lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the nuclear pores and in the disintegration of the nuclear envelope during [[mitosis]] and its reassembly at the end of the process.<ref name=Davidson />\n\nThe nuclear pores are highly efficient at selectively allowing the passage of materials to and from the nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. [[RNA]] and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. [[Histone]]s, gene regulatory proteins, [[DNA polymerase|DNA]] and [[RNA polymerase]]s, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000\u20134000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.<ref name=Alberts2>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Nuclear%20Envelope&rid=mboc4.section.2154#2156|title=Nuclear Pore Complexes Perforate the Nuclear Envelope|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Alberts|first=Walter|year=2002|work= Molecular Biology of the Cell 4th edition|publisher=Garland Science|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n=== Endoplasmic reticulum ===\n[[Image:nucleus ER golgi.svg|thumb|350px|'''1'''&nbsp;[[Cell nucleus|Nucleus]]{{nbsp}}\n'''2'''&nbsp;[[Nuclear pore]]{{nbsp}}\n'''3'''&nbsp;Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER){{nbsp}}\n'''4'''&nbsp;Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER){{nbsp}}\n'''5'''&nbsp;[[Ribosome]] on the rough ER{{nbsp}}\n'''6'''&nbsp;[[Protein]]s that are transported{{nbsp}}\n'''7'''&nbsp;Transport [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]{{nbsp}}\n'''8'''&nbsp;[[Golgi apparatus]]{{nbsp}}\n'''9'''&nbsp;Cis face of the Golgi apparatus{{nbsp}}\n'''10'''&nbsp;Trans face of the Golgi apparatus{{nbsp}}\n'''11'''&nbsp;Cisternae of the Golgi apparatus]]\n\n{{main|Endoplasmic reticulum}}\n\nThe [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle that is an extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER [[cisterna]]l space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.<ref name=Cooper3>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=endoplasmic%20reticulum&rid=cooper.section.1466|title=The Endoplasmic Reticulum|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|year=2000|work= The Cell: A Molecular Approach|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc}}</ref>\n\nThe ER has a central role in producing, processing, and transporting [[Biochemistry|biochemical compounds]] for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, [[endosome]]s, [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[peroxisome]]s, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of [[amino acids]] that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the [[Chaperone (protein)#Human chaperone proteins|chaperone protein]] known as [[Binding immunoglobulin protein|BiP]] which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.<ref name=\"Bertolotti et al.\">{{cite journal|title=Dynamic interaction of BiP and ER stress transducers in the unfolded-protein response|journal=Nature Cell Biology|year=2000|first=Anne|last=Bertolotti|author2=Zhang, Yuhong |author3=Hendershot, Linda M. |author4=Harding, Heather P. |author5= Ron, David |pmid=10854322|volume=2|issue=6|pages=326\u2013333|doi=10.1038/35014014|url=http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v2/n6/abs/ncb0600_326.html|accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref>\n\nThe ER is involved in cotranslational sorting of proteins.

Sex hormones of vertebrates and the steroid hormones secreted by the [[adrenal gland]]s are among the steroids produced by the smooth ER in animal cells. The cells that synthesize these hormones are rich in smooth ER.<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 />\n\n[[Liver]] cells are another example of specialized cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide an example of the role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of [[glycogen]]. The [[Glycogenolysis|breakdown of glycogen]] eventually leads to the release of [[glucose]] from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 />\n\nEnzymes of the smooth ER can also help detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually involves the addition of a hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the [[cytochrome P450]] family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 />\n\nMuscle cells have another specialized function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps [[calcium]] ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes back across the ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 />\n\n==== Functions of the rough ER ====\nMany types of cells export proteins produced by ribosomes attached to the rough ER. The ribosomes assemble [[amino acids]] into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either [[transmembrane proteins]], which become embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able to pass through the membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and modification.<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 />\n\nOnce secretory proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates them from the proteins that will remain in the cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit to another part of the cell are called [[Vesicular transport protein|transport vesicles]].<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 /> An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called [[membrane contact site]]s where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Levine T, Loewen C |title=Inter-organelle membrane contact sites: through a glass, darkly |journal=Curr. Opin.

As [[polypeptides]] intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their [[hydrophobic]] portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.<ref name=Cooper3 /><ref name=Alberts3 />\n\n=== Golgi apparatus ===\n[[Image:Human leukocyte, showing golgi - TEM.jpg|thumb|350px|Micrograph of Golgi apparatus, visible as a stack of semicircular black rings near the bottom. Numerous circular vesicles can be seen in proximity to the organelle]]\n\n{{main|Golgi apparatus}}\n\nThe [[Golgi apparatus]] (also known as the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is composed of separate sacs called [[cisternae]]. Its shape is similar to a stack of pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The Golgi apparatus is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the Golgi apparatus that receives the vesicles from the ER is known as the cis face, and is usually near the ER. The opposite end of the Golgi apparatus is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. The trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the Golgi apparatus modifies are sent.<ref name=Rothman>{{cite journal|title=The golgi apparatus: two organelles in tandem|journal=Science|year=1981|first=J.|last=Rothman|volume=213|issue=4513|pages=1212\u20131219|doi= 10.1126/science.7268428|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/gca?SEARCHID=1&FULLTEXT=%28Golgi+AND+Apparatus%29&FIRSTINDEX=0&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&gca=213%2F4513%2F1212&sendit.x=59&sendit.y=13|accessdate=2008-10-04|pmid=7268428}}</ref>\n\nVesicles sent off by the ER containing proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport to other parts of the cell. Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus. The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of [[oligosaccharides]]. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces [[pectins]] and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.<ref name=Alberts4>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=golgi%20apparatus&rid=mboc4.section.2333|title=Transport from the ER through the Golgi Apparatus|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Alberts|first=Walter|year=2002|work= Molecular Biology of the Cell 4th edition|publisher=Garland Science|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nOnce the modification process is completed, the Golgi apparatus sorts the products of its processing and sends them to various parts of the cell. Molecular identification labels or tags are added by the Golgi enzymes to help with this. After everything is organized, the Golgi apparatus sends off its products by budding vesicles from its trans face.<ref name=Cooper4>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Golgi%20apparatus&rid=cooper.section.1498|title=The Golgi Apparatus|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|year=2000|work= The Cell: A Molecular Approach|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc}}</ref>\n\n=== Vacuoles ===\n{{main|Vacuole}}\n\n[[Vacuole]]s, like vesicles, are membrane-bound sacs within the cell. They are larger than vesicles and their specific function varies. The operations of vacuoles are different for plant and animal vacuoles.\n\nIn plant cells, vacuoles cover anywhere from 30% to 90% of the total cell volume.<ref name=Alberts5>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Vacuoles&rid=mboc4.section.2363#2369|title=Plant and Fungal Vacuoles Are Remarkably Versatile Lysosomes|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Alberts|first=Walter|year=2002|work= Molecular Biology of the Cell 4th edition|publisher=Garland Science|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the [[cell sap]]. [[Pigments]] that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also increase the size of the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the [[turgor pressure]] (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H<sup>+</sup> ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole in order to keep the cytosol's pH constant.<ref name=Lodish1>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Vacuoles&rid=mcb.section.1182#1187|title=Plant Vacuoles Store Small Molecules and Enable the Cell to Elongate Rapidly|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Lodish|first=Harvey|year=2000|work= Molecular Cell Biology|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nIn animals, vacuoles serve in [[exocytosis]] and [[endocytosis]] processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances are taken into the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There are two types of endocytosis, [[phagocytosis]] (cell eating) and [[pinocytosis]] (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.<ref name=Cooper5>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=phagocytosis&rid=cooper.section.2017#2018|title=Endocytosis|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|year=2000|work= The Cell: A Molecular Approach|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc}}</ref>\n\n=== Vesicles ===\n{{main|Vesicle (biology)}}\n\n[[Vesicle (biology)|Vesicles]] are small membrane-enclosed transport units that can transfer molecules between different compartments. Most vesicles transfer the membranes assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and then from the Golgi apparatus to various locations.<ref name=Lodish2>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Vesicles&rid=mcb.section.4883#4887|title=Section 17.10 Molecular Mechanisms of Vesicular Traffic|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Lodish|first=Harvey|year=2000|work= Molecular Cell Biology|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThere are various types of vesicles each with a different protein configuration. Most are formed from specific regions of membranes. When a vesicle buds off from a membrane it contains specific proteins on its cytosolic surface. Each membrane a vesicle travels to contains a marker on its cytosolic surface. This marker corresponds with the proteins on the vesicle traveling to the membrane. Once the vesicle finds the membrane, they fuse.<ref name=Alberts6>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=vesicles&rid=mboc4.section.2306#2308|title=The Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Transport and the Maintenance of Compartmental Diversity|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Alberts|first=Walter|year=2002|work= Molecular Biology of the Cell 4th edition|publisher=Garland Science|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThere are three well known types of vesicles. They are [[clathrin]]-coated, [[COPI]]-coated, and [[COPII]]-coated vesicles. Each performs different functions in the cell. For example, clathrin-coated vesicles transport substances between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles are frequently used for transportation between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=Alberts6 />\n\n=== Lysosomes ===\n{{main|Lysosomes}}\n\n[[Lysosomes]] are organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that are used for intracellular digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are [[acid hydrolases]] which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle.<ref name=Alberts1>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Lysosomes&rid=mboc4.section.2363#2365|title=Transport from the Trans Golgi Network to Lysosomes|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Alberts|first=Walter|year=2002|work= Molecular Biology of the Cell 4th edition|publisher=Garland Science|display-authors=etal}}</ref> If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.\n\nLysosomes carry out intracellular digestion, in a process called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called [[autophagy]]. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are then returned to the cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]].<ref name=Cooper6>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=lysosomes&rid=cooper.section.1519|title=Lysosomes|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|year=2000|work= The Cell: A Molecular Approach|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc}}</ref>\n\n=== Spitzenk\u00f6rper ===\n{{main|Spitzenk\u00f6rper}}\n\nThe spitzenk\u00f6rper is a component of the endomembrane system found only in [[fungi]], and is associated with [[Hypha|hyphal tip growth]]. It is a [[phase contrast|phase]]-dark body that is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound vesicles containing cell wall components, serving as a point of assemblage and release of such components intermediate between the Golgi and the cell membrane. The spitzenk\u00f6rper is motile and generates new hyphal tip growth as it moves forward.<ref name=Steinberg />\n\n[[Image:Cell membrane detailed diagram 4.svg|thumb|350px|Detailed illustration of the plasma membrane. Including the structure of a [[phospholipid]].]]\n\n=== Plasma membrane ===\n{{main|Plasma membrane}}\n\nThe [[plasma membrane]] is a phospholipid bilayer membrane that separates the cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals into and out of the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by [[diffusion]] or [[osmosis]]. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through [[active transport]].<ref name=Cooper7>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=plasma%20membrane&rid=cooper.section.1967|title=Structure of the Plasma Membrane|accessdate=2008-12-09|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|year=2000|work= The Cell: A Molecular Approach|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc}}</ref>\n\nThe plasma membrane of a cell has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the [[osmotic pressure]] of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.<ref name=\"Cooper7\"/>\n\nIn addition to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the [[cytoskeleton]] and [[extracellular matrix]]; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.<ref name=Lodish3>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Cell%20Membrane&rid=mcb.section.1146#1168|title=Section 5.3.

In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] doctrine, with ''[[cultural anthropology]]'' becoming dominant especially in the [[United States]], and ''[[social anthropology]]'' in [[Great Britain]].  The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.\n\n[[File:Levi-strauss_260.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]]]\nThe 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the [[Western world]]), such as the notion of the \"[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]\".  This term was used in conjunction with \"savages\", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the \"[[noble savage]]\". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a dualist manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (history)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between \"societies with histories\" and \"societies without histories\", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.\n\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[cannibalism]] as an early example of ethnology. L\u00e9vi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralism|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the [[incest taboo]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Derrida]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]].\n\nThe French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included L\u00e9vi-Strauss, [[Paul Rivet]], [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]].\n\n[[File:Izmir Ethnography Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=text|[[Izmir Ethnography Museum]] (\u0130zmir Etnografya M\u00fczesi) seen from the courtyard.]]\n\n==Scholars==\n* [[List of scholars of ethnology]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n*[[Anthropology]]\n*[[Ethnography]]\n*[[Folklore studies]]\n*[[Cultural survival]]\n*[[Culture]]\n*[[Ethnocentrism]]\n*[[Evolutionism]]\n*[[Indigenous peoples]]\n{{Col-2-of-3}}\n*[[Intangible cultural heritage]]\n*[[Marxism]]\n*[[Meta-analysis]]\n*[[Modernism]]\n*[[Post-Modernism]]\n*[[Postcolonial]]\n*[[Primitive culture]]\n{{Col-3-of-3}}\n*[[Primitivism]]\n*[[Scientific Racism]]\n*[[Secondary research]]\n*[[Society]]\n*[[Structural anthropology]]\n*[[Structural functionalism]]\n*[[Ethnobiology]]\n*[[Ethnopoetics]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n<!-- Please include only very famous or/and easily accessible works here; put original dates of publication; only a few representative works by author.-->\n\n*[[Johann Georg Adam Forster|Forster, Johann Georg Adam]].

This sauce was already compiled in different Spanish cooking handbooks of the late 19th century,<ref>[http://www.casadellibro.com/libro-novisimo-manual-practico-de-cocina-espanola-francesa-y-american-a-ed-facsimil-de-la-ed-de-1885/9788497610940/939008 jsjsjNov\u00edsimo Manual de Cocina Espa\u00f1ola, Francesa y Americana (1885)].

As a mother sauce, it serves as the starting point for many derivatives, such as [[sauce Africaine|sauce africaine]], sauce [[Bitter orange|bigarade]], [[sauce Bourguignonne|sauce bourguignonne]], sauce aux [[Agaricus bisporus|champignons]], [[sauce charcuti\u00e8re]], [[Chasseur (sauce)|sauce chasseur]], sauce chevreuil, and [[demi-glace]]. Hundreds of other derivatives are in the classical French repertoire.\n\nEscoffier included a recipe for a [[Lent]]en espagnole sauce, using fish stock and mushrooms, in ''[[Le Guide culinaire]]'', but doubted its necessity.\n\n==Preparation==\n\nThe basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown [[roux]], to which [[veal]] [[stock (food)|stock]] or water is added, along with  browned bones, pieces of [[beef]], [[vegetable]]s, and various [[seasoning]]s.  This blend is allowed to slowly reduce while being frequently skimmed. The classic recipe calls for additional veal stock to be added as the liquid gradually reduces, but today, water is generally used, instead. [[Tomato paste]] or pureed tomatoes are added towards the end of the process, and the sauce is further reduced.<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough ''espagnole'' is the French word for \"Spanish\", the sauce's connection to Spanish cuisine is argued by French cooks.  According to [[Louis Diat]], the creator of ''[[vichyssoise]]'' and the author of the classic ''Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook'':<blockquote> \"There is a story that explains why the most important basic brown sauce in French cuisine is called ''sauce espagnole'', or Spanish sauce.  According to the story, the Spanish cooks of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]'s bride, Anne, helped to prepare their wedding feast, and insisted upon improving the rich brown sauce of France with Spanish [[tomato]]es.  This new sauce was an instant success, and was gratefully named in honor of its creators.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Waters | first = Mrs. W.G. | year = 1920 | title = The Cook's Decameron: A Study In Taste | publisher = IndyPublish.com | isbn = 1-4043-4580-9 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn ''Kettner's Book of the Table'', published in 1877, an entirely different explanation is given:\n\n{{quote|When the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] made their way to the [[Philip V of Spain|Spanish throne]] under [[Louis XV]], and when Spanish fashions came back to Paris, the French cooks took a hint from the Spanish ''[[pot-au-feu]]''\u2014the ''[[olla podrida]]''\u2014and produced a variation of their brown sauce which they called \"Spanish\". The essential principle of the French ''pot-au-feu'' was beef; the essential principle of the Spanish was [[bacon]], [[ham]], the red Estremadura [[sausage]]\u2014all well smoked... The [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de St. Simon]] sent home marvellous accounts of the hams of [[Mont\u00e1nchez|Montanches]]; there grew up a rage for [[Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico|Spanish hams]]; and the French were not to blame, for they have no hams of their own which have any reputation. Great as they are in pig's flesh, they are poor hands at bacon and ham; and the treasures of Montanches were a revelation to them. They ran wild after ham... And so, by introducing the flavour of the [[Extremadura|Estremadura]] bacon and ham into the old brown sauce of the French, there came into being the Spanish sauce... The hams of Montanches are not too plentiful in this world of sorrow, and the cooks came to be satisfied with any ham\u2014even with French ham, which is little better than salted pork. So the meaning of the prescription was lost; the peculiarity of the Spanish sauce passed away, and its name became a puzzle.<ref>E.S.Dallas (1877), ''Kettner's Book of the Table'', Dullau and Co., London, digitized by Google, retrieved 2008</ref>}}\n\nThe name \"Kettner\" in the title refers to Auguste Kettner, former chef to [[Napoleon III]], who emigrated to England and in 1867 opened a restaurant in [[Soho]]\u2014[http://www.kettners.com/ ''Kettner's'']\u2014one of the oldest restaurants in London.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brown sauce (meat stock based)|Brown sauce]]\n*[[Demi-glace]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Cookbook}}\n* [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=930 ''The Cook's Decameron'' from Project Gutenberg]\n* [http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_10351,00.html Emeril Lagasse's recipe at foodtv.com]\n\n{{Brown sauces}}\n\n{{portal bar|Food}}\n\n[[Category:Brown sauces]]\n[[Category:French sauces]]\n[[Category:Mother sauces]]\n\n[[de:Grundsauce#Braune Grundsaucen]]", "sha1": "9jzi5zaohtjtd3zlu2wwvj9levjrgac"}}, {"title": "Amplifier", "ns": "0", "id": "9931", "revision": {"id": "866738681", "parentid": "866737398", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T06:59:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Johnuniq", "id": "6036800"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/27.97.157.47|27.97.157.47]] ([[User talk:27.97.157.47|talk]]) to last version by Wtshymanski", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|electronic amplifiers}}\n[[File:McIntosh MC2505.jpg|thumb|A 100 watt stereo audio amplifier used in home component audio systems in the 1970s.]]\n \n[[File:Amplification2.svg|thumb|Graph of the input <math>v_i(t)</math> ''<span style=\"color:blue;\">(blue)</span>'' and output voltage <math>v_o(t)</math> ''<span style=\"color:red;\">(red)</span>'' of an ideal linear amplifier with an arbitrary signal applied as input.

Amplification is fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment. Amplifiers can be categorized in different ways. One is by the [[frequency]] of the electronic signal being amplified. For example, [[audio amplifier]]s amplify signals in the [[Sound|audio]] (sound) range of less than 20&nbsp;kHz, RF amplifiers amplify frequencies in the [[radio frequency]] range between 20&nbsp;kHz and 300&nbsp;GHz, and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current.

Vacuum tubes were used in almost all amplifiers until the 1960s\u20131970s when the [[transistor]], invented in 1947, replaced them.  Today, most amplifiers use transistors, but vacuum tubes continue to be used in some applications.\n[[File:First Audion amplifier 1914.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|De Forest's prototype audio amplifier of 1914.

In [[telegraphy]], this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a [[relay]], so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.\nFor duplex transmission, i.e. sending and receiving in both directions, bi-directional relay repeaters were developed starting with the work of [[C. F. Varley]] for telegraphic transmission. Duplex transmission was essential for telephony and the problem was not satisfactorily solved until 1904, when H. E.

Early tube amplifiers often had [[positive feedback]] ([[regenerative circuit|regeneration]]), which could increase gain but also make the amplifier unstable and prone to oscillation.  Much of the mathematical theory of amplifiers was developed at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] during the 1920s to 1940s.  Distortion levels in early amplifiers were high, usually around 5%, until 1934, when [[Harold Black]] developed [[Negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]]; this allowed the distortion levels to be greatly reduced, at the cost of lower gain.

Power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until the latter half of the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. The old Shreeve electroacoustic carbon repeaters were used in adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s.<ref>AT&T, Bell System Practices Section C65.114, ''Telephone Sets for Subscribers with Impaired Hearing \u2014 334 Type''</ref>  \n\nThe replacement of bulky electron tubes with [[transistor]]s during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the [[transistor radio]] developed in 1954.  Today, use of vacuum tubes is limited for some high power applications, such as radio transmitters.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, more and more transistors were connected on a single chip thereby creating higher scales of integration (small-scale, medium-scale, large-scale, etc.) in [[integrated circuit]]s. Many amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.\n\nFor special purposes, other active elements have been used. For example, in the early days of the [[satellite communication]], [[parametric amplifier]]s were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacitance was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions, this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station.\n\nAdvances in digital electronics since the late 20th century provided new alternatives to the traditional linear-gain amplifiers by using digital switching to vary the pulse-shape of fixed amplitude signals, resulting in devices such as the [[Class-D amplifier]].\n\n==Ideal==\n[[File:Dependent Sources.PNG|thumbnail|300px|The four types of dependent source\u2014control variable on left, output variable on right]]\nIn principle, an amplifier is an electrical [[two-port network]] that produces a signal at the output port that is a replica of the signal applied to the input port, but increased in magnitude.\n\nThe input port can be idealized as either being a voltage input, which takes no current, with the output proportional to the voltage across the port; or a current input, with no voltage across it, in which the output is proportional to the current through the port.  The output port can be idealized as being either a [[dependent voltage source]], with zero source resistance and its output voltage dependent on the input; or a [[dependent current source]], with infinite source resistance and the output current dependent on the input. Combinations of these choices lead to four types of ideal amplifiers.<ref name=\"Patronis\"/> In idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of [[dependent source]] used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis is often used to find the actual impedance. A small-signal AC test current ''I<sub>x</sub>'' is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to AC zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage ''V<sub>x</sub>'' across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as ''R = V<sub>x</sub> / I<sub>x</sub>''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eeherald.com/section/design-guide/signal_analysis_amplifiers.html|title=Small signal analysis of Complex amplifier circuits|website=www.eeherald.com|access-date=2016-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009041842/http://www.eeherald.com/section/design-guide/signal_analysis_amplifiers.html|archivedate=2016-10-09|df=}}</ref>\n\nAmplifiers designed to attach to a [[transmission line]] at input and output, especially [[RF power amplifier|RF amplifiers]], do not fit into this classification approach.  Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match ''ratios'' of voltage to current.  Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal.  Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.<ref>{{cite book | title = Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals | author = John Everett | publisher = IET | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-86341-200-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&pg=PA84&dq=amplifier+impedance+transmission-line++dB#PPA81,M1 }}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n{{Main|Amplifier figures of merit}}\nAmplifier properties are given by parameters that include: \n* [[Gain (electronics)|Gain]], the ratio between the magnitude of output and input signals\n* [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|Bandwidth]], the width of the useful [[#Frequency range|frequency range]]\n* [[Electrical efficiency|Efficiency]], the ratio between the power of the output and total power consumption\n* [[Nonlinear system|Linearity]], the extent to which the proportion between input and output amplitude is the same for high amplitude and low amplitude input\n* [[Noise (electronics)|Noise]], a measure of undesired noise mixed into the output\n* Output [[dynamic range]], the ratio of the largest and the smallest useful output levels\n* [[Slew rate]], the maximum rate of change of the output\n* [[Rise time]], [[settling time]], [[Ringing (signal)|ringing]] and [[Overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] that characterize the [[step response]]\n* [[BIBO stability|Stability]], the ability to avoid [[Parasitic oscillation|self-oscillation]]\n\nAmplifiers are described according to the properties of their inputs, their outputs, and how they relate.<ref>{{cite book | title = Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory, 7th Edition | author = Robert Boylestad and Louis Nashelsky | publisher = Prentice Hall College Division | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-13-375734-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TRBTAAAAMAAJ&q=Electronic+Devices+and+Circuit+Theory&dq=Electronic+Devices+and+Circuit+Theory }}</ref> All amplifiers have gain, a multiplication factor that relates the magnitude of some property of the output signal to a property of the input signal. The gain may be specified as the ratio of output [[voltage]] to input voltage ([[voltage gain]]), output power to input power ([[power gain]]), or some combination of current, voltage, and power. In many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB)).\n\nMost amplifiers are designed to be linear. That is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and output signal. If an amplifier's gain is not linear, the output signal can become [[Distortion|distorted]]. There are, however, cases where [[Variable-gain amplifier|variable gain]] is useful. Certain signal processing applications use exponential gain amplifiers.<ref name=\"Patronis\"/>\n\nAmplifiers are usually designed to function well in a specific application, for example: [[radio]] and [[television]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[high-fidelity]] (\"hi-fi\") stereo equipment, microcomputers and other digital equipment, and [[guitar]] and other [[instrument amplifier]]s. Every amplifier includes at least one [[active device]], such as a [[vacuum tube]] or [[transistor]].\n\n==Negative feedback==\n[[Negative feedback]] is a technique used in most modern amplifiers to improve bandwidth and distortion and control gain.  In a negative feedback amplifier part of the output is fed back and added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting from the input.   The main effect is to reduce the overall gain of the system. However, any unwanted signals introduced by the amplifier, such as distortion are also fed back.  Since they are not part of the original input, they are added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting them from the input. In this way, negative feedback also reduces nonlinearity, distortion and other errors introduced by the amplifier. Large amounts of negative feedback can reduce errors to the point that the response of the amplifier itself becomes almost irrelevant as long as it has a large gain, and the output performance of the system (the \"closed loop performance\") is defined entirely by the components in the feedback loop.  This technique is particularly used with [[operational amplifier]]s (op-amps).\n\nNon-feedback amplifiers can only achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. With [[negative feedback]], distortion can typically be reduced to 0.001%.  Noise, even crossover distortion, can be practically eliminated.  Negative feedback also compensates for changing temperatures, and degrading or nonlinear components in the gain stage, but any change or nonlinearity in the components in the feedback loop will affect the output. Indeed, the ability of the feedback loop to define the output is used to make [[active filter|active filter circuits]]. \n\nAnother advantage of negative feedback is that it extends the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the amplifier.    The concept of feedback is used in [[operational amplifier]]s to precisely define gain, bandwidth, and other parameters entirely based on the components in the feedback loop.\n\nNegative feedback can be applied at each stage of an amplifier to stabilize the [[operating point]] of active devices against minor changes in power-supply voltage or device characteristics.\n\nSome feedback, positive or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable\u2014introduced, for example, by [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic elements]], such as inherent capacitance between input and output of devices such as transistors, and capacitive coupling of external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce [[parasitic oscillation]] and turn an amplifier into an [[oscillator]].\n\n== Categories ==\n=== Active devices ===\nAll amplifiers include some form of active device: this is the device that does the actual amplification. The active device can be a [[vacuum tube]], discrete solid state component, such as a single [[transistor]], or part of an [[integrated circuit]], as in an [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]).\n\n[[Transistor]] amplifiers (or solid state amplifiers) are the most common type of amplifier in use today. A transistor is used as the active element. The gain of the amplifier is determined by the properties of the transistor itself as well as the circuit it is contained within.\n\nCommon active devices in transistor amplifiers include [[bipolar junction transistor]]s (BJTs) and [[metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs).\n\nApplications are numerous, some common examples are audio amplifiers in a home stereo or [[public address|public address system]], RF high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to RF and microwave applications such as radio transmitters.\n\nTransistor-based amplification can be realized using various configurations: for example a bipolar junction transistor can realize [[common base]], [[common collector]] or [[common emitter]] amplification; a MOSFET can realize [[common gate]], [[common source]] or [[common drain]] amplification. Each configuration has different characteristics.\n\n[[Valve amplifier|Vacuum-tube amplifiers]] (also known as tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a [[vacuum tube]] as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers can be much more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many [[#Microwave amplifiers|microwave amplifiers]] are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the [[klystron]], [[gyrotron]], [[traveling wave tube]], and [[crossed-field amplifier]], and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Robert S.

In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load [[Electrical impedance|impedances]], as well as the inherent voltage and current gain. A [[radio frequency]] (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20&nbsp;dB might have a voltage gain of 20&nbsp;dB and an available power gain of much more than 20&nbsp;dB (power ratio of 100)\u2014yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600&nbsp;\u03a9 microphone and the output connects to a 47&nbsp;[[Ohm|k\u03a9]] input socket for a power amplifier. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the [[biasing]] of the output transistors or tubes: see [[#Power amplifier classes|power amplifier classes]] below.\n\n[[Audio power amplifier]]s are typically used to drive [[loudspeaker]]s. They will often have [[Stereophonic sound|two output channels]] and deliver equal power to each. An [[RF power amplifier]] is found in radio [[transmitter]] final stages. A [[Servo drive|Servo motor controller]]: amplifies a control voltage to adjust the speed of a motor, or the position of a motorized system.\n\n=== Operational amplifiers (op-amps) ===\n[[File:LM741CN.jpg|thumb|An LM741 general purpose [[Operational amplifier|op-amp]]]]\n{{Main|Operational amplifier|Instrumentation amplifier}}\nAn operational amplifier is an amplifier circuit which typically has very high open loop gain and differential inputs. Op amps have become very widely used as standardized \"gain blocks\" in circuits due to their versatility; their gain, bandwidth and other characteristics can be controlled by [[feedback]] through an external circuit.  Though the term today commonly applies to integrated circuits, the original operational amplifier design used valves, and later designs used discrete transistor circuits.\n\nA [[fully differential amplifier]] is similar to the operational amplifier, but also has differential outputs. These are usually constructed using [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJTs]] or [[Field-effect transistor|FETs]].\n\n=== Distributed amplifiers ===\n{{Main|Distributed amplifier}}\nThese use balanced [[transmission line]]s to separate individual single stage amplifiers, the outputs of which are summed by the same transmission line. The transmission line is a balanced type with the input at one end and on one side only of the balanced transmission line and the output at the opposite end is also the opposite side of the balanced transmission line. The gain of each stage adds linearly to the output rather than multiplies one on the other as in a cascade configuration. This allows a higher bandwidth to be achieved than could otherwise be realised  even with the same gain stage elements.\n\n=== Switched mode amplifiers ===\nThese nonlinear amplifiers have much higher efficiencies than linear amps, and are used where the power saving justifies the extra complexity. [[Class-D amplifier]]s are the main example of this type of amplification.\n\n=== Applications ===\n==== Video amplifiers ====\nVideo amplifiers are designed to process video signals and have varying bandwidths depending on whether the video signal is for SDTV, EDTV, HDTV 720p or 1080i/p etc.. The specification of the bandwidth itself depends on what kind of filter is used\u2014and at which point ({{nowrap|\u22121 dB}} or {{nowrap|\u22123 dB}} for example) the bandwidth is measured. Certain requirements for step response and overshoot are necessary for an acceptable TV image.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/amplifiers/video.aspx|title=What is a video amplifier, video booster amplifiers - Future Electronics|website=www.futureelectronics.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Microwave amplifiers ====\n[[Traveling wave tube]] amplifiers (TWTAs) are used for high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. They typically can amplify across a broad spectrum of frequencies; however, they are usually not as tunable as klystrons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-030.htm|title=Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers|website=www.r-type.org|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Klystron]]s are specialized linear-beam vacuum-devices, designed to provide high power, widely tunable amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. Klystrons are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than TWTAs, they have the advantage of coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.\n\nSolid-state devices are used such as [[Field effect transistor|GaAs FET]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s, and others, especially at lower microwave frequencies and power levels on the order of watts.\n\nThe [[maser]] is a non-electronic microwave amplifier.\n\n==== Musical instrument amplifiers ====\n[[Instrument amplifiers]] are a range of audio power amplifiers used to increase the sound level of musical instruments, for example guitars, during performances.\n\n== Classification of amplifier stages and systems ==\n=== Common terminal ===\nOne set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, the three classes are common emitter, common base, and common collector. For [[field-effect transistor]]s, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for [[vacuum tube]]s, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.\n\nThe common emitter (or common source, common cathode, etc.) is most often configured to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.\n\n=== Unilateral or bilateral ===\nAn amplifier whose output exhibits no feedback to its input side is described as 'unilateral'. The input impedance of a unilateral amplifier is independent of load, and output impedance is independent of signal source impedance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/active-directivity-of-amplifiers|title=Microwaves101 {{!}} Active Directivity of Amplifiers|last=Administrator|website=www.microwaves101.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref>\n\nAn amplifier that uses feedback to connect part of the output back to the input is a ''bilateral'' amplifier. Bilateral amplifier input impedance depends on the load, and output impedance on the signal source impedance.\nAll amplifiers are bilateral to some degree; however they may often be modeled as unilateral under operating conditions where feedback is small enough to neglect for most purposes, simplifying analysis (see the [[common base]] article for an example).\n\n=== Inverting or non-inverting ===\nAnother way to classify amplifiers is by the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal.  An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an [[oscilloscope]]). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An [[emitter follower]] is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. Voltage follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.\n\nThis description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.\n\n=== Function ===\nOther amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages.\n*A '''[[servo drive|servo amplifier]]''' indicates an integrated [[feedback loop]] to actively control the output at some desired level. A DC [[servomechanism|servo]] indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These are often used in mechanical actuators, or devices such as [[DC motor]]s that must maintain a constant speed or [[torque]]. An '''AC servo''' amp. can do this for some AC motors.\n*A '''linear''' amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and does not generate [[harmonic distortion]] or [[intermodulation]] distortion. No amplifier can provide ''perfect'' linearity (even the most linear amplifier has some nonlinearities, since the amplifying devices\u2014[[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tubes]]\u2014follow nonlinear [[power laws]] such as square-laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects).\n*A '''nonlinear''' amplifier generates significant distortion and so changes the harmonic content; there are situations where this is useful. Amplifier [[non-linear circuits#Non-linear networks|circuits]] intentionally providing a non-linear [[transfer function]] include:\n** a device like a [[silicon controlled rectifier]] or a [[transistor#Transistor as a switch|transistor used as a switch]] may be employed to turn either fully ''on'' or ''off'' a load such as a lamp based on a threshold in a continuously variable input.\n** a non-linear amplifier in an [[analog computer]] or [[true RMS converter]] for example can provide  a special transfer function, such as logarithmic or square-law.\n** a [[Power amplifier classes#Class C|Class C]] [[radio frequency|RF]] amplifier may be chosen because it can be very efficient\u2014but is non-linear. Following such an amplifier with a so-called ''[[LC circuit|tank]]'' [[tuned circuit]] can reduce unwanted harmonics (distortion) sufficiently to make it useful in [[transmitters]], or some desired [[harmonic]] may be selected by setting the [[Electronic filter|resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit to a higher [[frequency]] rather than [[fundamental frequency]] in [[frequency multiplier]] circuits.\n** [[Automatic gain control]] circuits require an amplifier's gain be controlled by the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received. The non-linearities are assumed arranged so the relatively small signal amplitude suffers from little distortion (cross-channel interference or [[intermodulation]]) yet is still [[modulated]] by the relatively large gain-control [[direct current|DC]] voltage.\n** [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] detector circuits that use amplification such as [[anode-bend detector]]s, [[precision rectifier]]s and [[infinite impedance detector]]s (so excluding ''unamplified'' detectors such as [[cat's-whisker detector]]s), as well as [[Peak detector#Peak detector|peak detector circuits]], rely on changes in amplification based on the [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]'s instantaneous amplitude to derive a [[direct current]] from an [[alternating current]] input.\n** [[Operational amplifier applications#Comparators and detectors|Operational amplifier comparator and detector circuits]].\n*A '''wideband''' amplifier has a precise amplification factor over a wide frequency range, and is often used to boost signals for relay in communications systems. A '''narrowband''' amp amplifies a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies.\n*An '''RF''' amplifier amplifies signals in the [[radio frequency]] range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and is often used to increase the sensitivity of a [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] or the output power of a [[transmitter]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=Apratim|author2=Rashid, S.

This category subdivides into small signal amplification, and power amps that are optimised to driving [[loudspeaker|speaker]]s, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements. Frequently used terms within audio amplifiers include:\n** [[Preamplifier]] (preamp.), which may include a [[phonograph|phono]] preamp with [[RIAA equalization]], or [[tape head]] preamps with [[Comit\u00e9 consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] equalisation filters. They may include [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]s or [[tone control]] circuitry.\n** [[Power amplifier]] (normally drives [[loudspeaker]]s), [[headphone]] amplifiers, and [[public address#Amplifiers|public address amplifiers]].\n** [[Stereo]] amplifiers imply two channels of output (left and right), though the term simply means \"solid\" sound (referring to three-dimensional)\u2014so [[quadraphonic]] stereo was used for amplifiers with four channels. 5.1 and 7.1 systems refer to [[Home theatre system]]s with 5 or 7 normal spatial channels, plus a [[subwoofer]] channel.\n*[[Buffer amplifiers]], which may include [[emitter follower]]s, provide a high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] input for a device (perhaps another amplifier, or perhaps an energy-hungry load such as lights) that would otherwise draw too much current from the source. [[Line driver]]s are a type of buffer that feeds long or interference-prone interconnect cables, possibly with [[differential signaling|differential]] outputs through [[twisted pair]] cables.\n\n=== Interstage coupling method ===\n{{See also|multistage amplifiers}}\nAmplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include:\n;Resistive-capacitive (RC) coupled amplifier, using a network of resistors and capacitors: By design these amplifiers cannot amplify DC signals as the capacitors block the DC component of the input signal. RC-coupled amplifiers were used very often in circuits with vacuum tubes or discrete transistors. In the days of the integrated circuit a few more transistors on a chip are much cheaper and smaller than a capacitor.\n;Inductive-capacitive (LC) coupled amplifier, using a network of inductors and capacitors: This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective radio-frequency circuits.\n;[[Transformer]] coupled amplifier, using a transformer to match impedances or to decouple parts of the circuits :Quite often LC-coupled and transformer-coupled amplifiers cannot be distinguished as a transformer is some kind of inductor.\n;[[Direct coupled amplifier]], using no impedance and bias matching components: This class of amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube days when the anode (output) voltage was at greater than several hundred volts and the grid (input) voltage at a few volts minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC (e.g., in an oscilloscope). In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible. In FET and CMOS technologies direct coupling is dominant since gates of MOSFETs theoretically pass no current through themselves. Therefore, DC component of the input signals is automatically filtered.\n\n=== Frequency range ===\nDepending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.\n\nFrequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. Amplifiers for direct current signals are vulnerable to minor variations in the properties of components with time.  Special methods, such as [[chopper (electronics)|chopper]] stabilized amplifiers are used to prevent objectionable drift in the amplifier's properties for DC. \"DC-blocking\" [[capacitor]]s can be added to remove DC and sub-sonic frequencies from audio amplifiers.\n\nDepending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only \"discrete\" properties need be considered; e.g., a terminal has an input impedance.\n\nAs soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g., at 100&nbsp;MHz the wavelength is 3&nbsp;m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3&nbsp;cm) design properties radically change. For example, a specified length and width of a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.\nAbove a few hundred MHz, it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases, PCB traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead ([[stripline]] techniques).\n\nThe frequency range handled by an amplifier might be specified in terms of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (normally implying a response that is 3&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]] down when the frequency reaches the specified bandwidth), or by specifying a '''frequency response''' that is within a certain number of [[decibel]]s between a lower and an upper frequency (e.g. \"20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz plus or minus 1&nbsp;dB\").\n\n== Power amplifier classes ==\n{{Main|Power amplifier classes}}\nPower amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for [[analog circuit|analog]] designs\u2014and class D and E for switching designs. The [[power amplifier classes]] are based on the proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/analog/understanding-amplifier-operating-classes|title=Understanding Amplifier Operating \"Classes\"|website=electronicdesign.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref> The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360\u00b0. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180\u00b0. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier [[Electrical efficiency|power efficiency]].\n\n== Example amplifier circuit ==\n[[File:Amplifier Circuit Small.svg|350px|A practical amplifier circuit|alt=An electronic circuit diagram including resistors, capacitors, transistors and diodes|thumb]]\nThe practical amplifier circuit to the right could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB [[push\u2013pull output]] stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.\n\nThe input signal is coupled through [[capacitor]] C1 to the base of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the [[Alternating current|AC]] signal to pass, but blocks the [[Direct current|DC]] bias voltage established by [[resistor]]s R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a [[differential amplifier]] (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a [[long-tailed pair]]. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.\n\nThe negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a [[common emitter]] stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push\u2013pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide the majority of the current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The [[diode]]s D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).\n\nThis design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would [[roll-off]] the [[frequency response]] above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted [[oscillation]]. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors{{spaced ndash}} if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.\n\nA common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically one ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.\n\n== Notes on implementation ==\nAny real amplifier is an imperfect realization of an ideal amplifier. An important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds operational limits for the device. The power supply may influence the output, so must be considered in the design. The power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its input power.\n\nThe amplifier circuit has an \"open loop\" performance. This is described by various parameters (gain, [[slew rate]], output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], [[distortion]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[signal-to-noise ratio]], etc.). Many modern amplifiers use [[negative feedback]] techniques to hold the gain at the desired value and reduce distortion. Negative loop feedback has the intended effect of lowering the output impedance and thereby increasing electrical damping of loudspeaker motion at and near the resonance frequency of the speaker.\n\nWhen assessing rated amplifier power output, it is useful to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with [[Differential signaling|matching transformers]] at source and loads. This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.\n\nTo prevent instability or overheating requires care to ensure solid state amplifiers are adequately loaded. Most have a rated minimum load impedance.\n\nAll amplifiers generate heat through electrical losses. The amplifier must dissipate this heat via [[convection]] or forced air cooling. Heat can damage or reduce electronic component service life. Designers and installers must also consider heating effects on adjacent equipment.\n\nDifferent power supply types result in many different methods of [[Bias (electrical engineering)|bias]]. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.\n\nAmplifiers often have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a class-A stage, feeding a class-AB push\u2013pull second stage, which then drives a class-G final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n*[[Charge transfer amplifier]]\n*[[Distributed amplifier]]\n*[[Doherty amplifier]]\n*[[Faithful amplification]]\n*[[Low noise amplifier]]\n*[[Negative feedback amplifier]]\n*[[Optical amplifier]]\n*[[Power added efficiency]]\n*[[Programmable gain amplifier]]\n*[[Tuned amplifier]]\n*[[Double-tuned amplifier]]\n*[[CMOS Amplifiers]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|45em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Electronic amplifiers}}\n*[http://www.aes.org/par/a/#amplifier_classes AES guide to amplifier classes]\n*[http://www.audiodesignline.com/175006800 Design and analysis of a basic class D amplifier]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-thd.htm Conversion: distortion factor to distortion attenuation and THD]\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.crownaudio.com/media/pdf/amps/grbgpapr.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403044842/http://www.crownaudio.com/media/pdf/amps/grbgpapr.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-03 |title=An alternate topology called the grounded bridge amplifier |format=PDF}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.qscaudio.com:80/support/library/papers/amptalk.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610023359/http://www.qscaudio.com/support/library/papers/amptalk.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-06-10 |title=Amplifier Anatomy - Part 1 |format=PDF |df= }}{{snd}}contains an explanation of different amplifier classes\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.crownaudio.com/media/pdf/amps/bcapaper.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403062850/http://www.crownaudio.com/media/pdf/amps/bcapaper.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-03 |title=Reinventing the power amplifier |format=PDF}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041030161938/http://www.caraudiomag.com/specialfeatures/0111cae_anatomy/ Anatomy of the power amplifier, including information about classes]\n*[http://tons-of-tone.tripod.com/index.html Tons of Tones - Site explaining non linear distortion stages in Amplifier Models]\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.coldamp.com/opencms/opencms/coldamp/files/Class_D_audio_amplifiers_White_Paper_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929062038/http://www.coldamp.com/opencms/opencms/coldamp/files/Class_D_audio_amplifiers_White_Paper_en.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-29 |title=Class D audio amplifiers: theory and design |format=PDF}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.classeradio.org/index.html |title=Class E AM Transmitter Descriptions, Circuits, Etc.}}{{snd}}tutorials, schematics, examples, and construction details\n\n{{Electronic components}}\n{{Music technology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amplifier}}\n[[Category:Electronic amplifiers| ]]\n[[Category:Electronic circuits]]\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1906]]", "sha1": "p09k15qkjexkhtchucw7imji9uybim0"}}, {"title": "Escort carrier", "ns": "0", "id": "9932", "revision": {"id": "865934767", "parentid": "860224618", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T04:21:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Zackmann08", "id": "15881234"}, "comment": "Importing Wikidata [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: \"slow and small aircraft carrier\" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|slow and small aircraft carrier}}\n[[Image:HMS Audacity (D10).jpg|thumb|300px|Escort carrier {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}]]\n\nThe '''escort carrier''' or '''escort aircraft carrier''' (US [[hull classification symbol]] CVE), also called a \"jeep carrier\" or \"baby flattop\" in the [[United States Navy]] (USN) or \"Woolworth Carrier\" by the [[Royal Navy]], was a small and slow type of [[aircraft carrier]] used by the Royal Navy, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force#Army Escort-Aircraft Carriers|Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]], and the United States Navy in [[World War II]]. They were typically half the length and a third the displacement of larger [[fleet carrier]]s. While they were slower, carried fewer planes and were less well armed and armored, escort carriers were cheaper and could be built quickly, which was their principal advantage. Escort carriers could be completed in greater numbers as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. However, the lack of protection made escort carriers particularly vulnerable and several were sunk with great loss of life. The [[Light aircraft carrier|light carrier]] (hull classification symbol CVL) was a similar concept to escort carriers in most respects, but were capable of higher speeds to allow operation alongside fleet carriers.\n\nMost often built on a commercial ship hull, escort carriers were too slow to keep up with the main forces consisting of fleet carriers, battleships, and cruisers. Instead, they were used to escort [[convoy]]s, defending them from enemy threats such as submarines and planes. In the invasions of mainland Europe and Pacific islands, escort carriers provided [[air support]] to ground forces during [[amphibious operation]]s. Escort carriers also served as backup aircraft transports for fleet carriers and ferried aircraft of all military services to points of delivery.\n\nIn the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], escort carriers were used to protect convoys against [[U-boat]]s. Initially escort carriers accompanied the merchant ships and helped to fend off attacks from aircraft and submarines. As numbers increased later in the war, escort carriers also formed part of hunter-killer groups that [[Anti-submarine warfare#World War II|sought out submarines]] instead of being attached to a particular convoy.\n\nIn the Pacific theater, CVEs provided air support of ground troops in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. They lacked the speed and weapons to counter enemy fleets, relying on the protection of a [[Fast Carrier Task Force]]. However, at the [[Battle off Samar]], one U.S. task force of escort carriers managed to successfully defend itself against a much larger Japanese force of battleships and cruisers. The Japanese met a furious defense of carrier aircraft, screening destroyers, and destroyer escorts, proving that CVEs could appear to have the same striking power as full CVs.\n\nOf the 151 aircraft carriers built in the U.S. during World War II, 122 were escort carriers. Though no examples survive to this day, the {{sclass-|Casablanca|escort carrier|4}} was the most numerous class of aircraft carrier, with 50 launched. Second was the {{sclass-|Bogue|escort carrier|4}}, with 45 launched.\n\n==Development==\nIn the early 1920s, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] imposed limits on the maximum size and total tonnage of aircraft carriers for the five main naval powers. Later treaties largely kept these provisions. As a result, construction between the World Wars had been insufficient to meet operational needs for aircraft carriers as World War II expanded from Europe. Too few fleet carriers were available to simultaneously transport aircraft to distant bases, support amphibious invasions, offer carrier landing training for replacement pilots, conduct anti-submarine patrols, and provide defensive air cover for deployed battleships and cruisers. The foregoing mission requirements limited use of fleet carriers\u2032 unique offensive strike capability demonstrated at the [[Battle of Taranto]] and the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Conversion of existing ships (and hulls under construction for other purposes) provided additional aircraft carriers until new construction became available.\n\nConversions of cruisers and passenger liners with speed similar to fleet carriers were identified by the U.S. as \"[[light aircraft carrier]]s\" ([[hull classification symbol]] CVL) able to operate at battle fleet speeds. Slower conversions were classified as \"escort carriers\" and were considered naval auxiliaries suitable for pilot training and transport of aircraft to distant bases.\n\nThe Royal Navy had recognized a need for carriers to defend its trade routes in the 1930s.<ref>Hague 2000 p.83</ref> While designs had been prepared for \"trade protection carriers\" and five suitable liners identified for conversion, nothing further was done mostly because there were insufficient aircraft for even the fleet carriers under construction at the time. However, by 1940 the need had become urgent and {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}} was converted from the captured German merchant ship MV ''Hannover'' and commissioned in July 1941.<ref>Brown (2000) pp. 62\u201363</ref> For defense from German aircraft, convoys were supplied first with [[fighter catapult ship]]s and [[CAM ship]]s that could carry a single (disposable) fighter. In the interim, before escort carriers could be supplied, they also brought in [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s that could operate four aircraft.\n\nIn 1940, Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey]] recommended construction of naval auxiliaries for pilot training.<ref>Friedman 1983 p.162</ref> In early 1941 the British asked the US to build on their behalf six carriers of an improved ''Audacity'' design but the US had already begun their own escort carrier.<ref>Brown (2000) p. 63</ref> On 1 February 1941, the United States Chief of Naval Operations gave priority to construction of naval auxiliaries for aircraft transport.<ref>Friedman 1983 p. 165</ref> U.S. ships built to meet these needs were initially referred to as '''auxiliary aircraft escort vessels''' ('''AVG''') in February 1942 and then '''auxiliary aircraft carrier''' ('''ACV''') on 5 August 1942.<ref name=\"proceedings\">Evans, Robert L. \"Cinderella Carriers\". ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings''. August 1976. pp. 53\u201360.</ref> The first U.S. example of the type was {{USS|Long Island|AVG-1|6}}. [[Operation Torch]] and North Atlantic anti-submarine warfare proved these ships capable aircraft carriers for ship formations moving at the speed of trade or amphibious invasion convoys. U.S. classification revision to '''escort aircraft carrier''' ('''CVE''') on 15 July 1943 reflected upgraded status from auxiliary to combatant.<ref>Friedman 1983 pp. 159\u2013160</ref> They were informally known as \"Jeep carriers\" or \"baby flattops\". It was quickly found that the escort carriers had better performance than light carriers, which tended to pitch badly in moderate to high seas. The ''Commencement Bay'' class was designed to incorporate the best features of American CVLs on a more stable hull with a less expensive propulsion system.<ref>Friedman 1983 p. 159</ref>\n\nAmong their crews, CVE was sarcastically said to stand for \"Combustible, Vulnerable, and Expendable\". Magazine protection was minimal in comparison to fleet aircraft carriers.<ref>Friedman 1983 p. 176</ref> {{HMS|Avenger|D14|6}} was sunk within minutes by a single torpedo, and {{HMS|Dasher|D37|6}} exploded from undetermined causes with very heavy loss of life. Three escort carriers\u2014{{USS|St. Lo|CVE-63|6}}, {{USS|Ommaney Bay|CVE-79|2}} and {{USS|Bismarck Sea|CVE-95|2}}\u2014were destroyed by ''[[kamikaze]]s'', the largest ships to meet such a fate.\n\nAllied escort carriers were typically around {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, not much more than half the length of the almost {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} fleet carriers of the same era, but were less than 1/3 of the weight. A typical escort carrier displaced about {{convert|8000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}}, as compared to almost {{convert|30000|LT|t|abbr=on}} for a full-size fleet carrier. The aircraft [[hangar]] typically ran only {{sfrac|1|3}} of the way under the flight deck and housed a combination of 24\u201330 fighters and bombers organized into one single \"composite squadron\". By comparison, a late [[Essex-class aircraft carrier|''Essex''-class fleet carrier]] could carry a total of 103 aircraft organized into separate fighter, bomber and torpedo-bomber squadrons.\n\nThe island on these ships was small and cramped, and located well forward of the [[Chimney|funnel]]s (unlike on a normal-sized carrier where the funnels were integrated into the island). Although the first escort carriers had only one aircraft elevator, having two elevators (one fore and one aft), along with the single aircraft catapult, quickly became standard. The carriers employed the same system of arresting cables and tail hooks as on the big carriers, and procedures for launch and recovery were the same as well.\n\nThe crew size was less than {{frac|1|3}} of that of a large carrier, but this was still a bigger complement than most naval vessels. It was large enough to justify the existence of facilities such as a permanent canteen or snack bar, called a [[gedunk bar]], in addition to the mess. The bar was open for longer hours than the mess and sold several flavors of [[ice cream]], along with cigarettes and other consumables. There were also several [[vending machine]]s available on board.\n\nIn all, 130 Allied escort carriers were launched or converted during the war. Of these, six were British conversions of merchant ships: {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, {{HMS|Nairana|D05|2}}, {{HMS|Campania|D48|2}}, {{HMS|Activity|D94|2}}, {{HMS|Pretoria Castle|F61|2}} and {{HMS|Vindex|D15|2}}. The remaining escort carriers were U.S.-built. Like the British, the first U.S. escort carriers were converted merchant vessels (or in the {{sclass-|Sangamon|escort carrier|4}}, converted military oilers). The ''Bogue''-class carriers were based on the hull of the [[Type C3 ship|Type C3 cargo ship]]. The last 69 escort carriers of the {{sclass-|Casablanca|escort carrier|5}} and {{sclass-|Commencement Bay|escort carrier|5}} classes were purpose-designed and purpose-built carriers drawing on the experience gained with the previous classes.\n\n==Royal Navy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\nOriginally developed at the behest of the [[United Kingdom]] to operate as part of a North Atlantic [[convoy]] escort, rather than as part of a naval strike force, many of the  escort carriers produced were assigned to the Royal Navy for the duration of the war under the [[Lend-Lease]] act. They supplemented and then replaced the converted [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s that were put into service by the British and Dutch as an emergency measure until the escort carriers became available. As convoy escorts, they were used by the Royal Navy to provide air scouting, to ward off enemy long-range scouting aircraft and, increasingly, to spot and hunt submarines. Often additional escort carriers also joined convoys, not as fighting ships, but as transporters, ferrying aircraft from the U.S. to Britain. In this case, the aircraft cargo could be doubled by storing aircraft on the flight deck as well as in the hangar.\n\nThe ships sent to the Royal Navy were slightly modified, partly to suit the traditions of that service. Among other things the ice cream making machines were removed, since they were considered unnecessary luxuries on ships, which served [[grog]] and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s. The heavy duty [[washing machine]]s of the laundry room were also removed since \"all a British sailor needs to keep clean is a bucket and a bar of soap\" (quoted from Warrilow).\n\nOther modifications were due to the need for a completely enclosed hangar when operating in the [[North Atlantic]] and in support of the [[Arctic convoys]].\n\n==U.S. Navy service==\nMeanwhile, the U.S. discovered their own use for the escort carriers. In the North Atlantic, they supplemented the escorting [[destroyer]]s by providing air support for anti-submarine warfare. One of these escort carriers, {{USS|Guadalcanal|CVE-60|6}}, was instrumental in the capture of {{GS|U-505||2}} off North Africa in 1944.\n\nIn the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]], escort carriers lacked the speed to sail with fast carrier attack groups, so were often tasked to escort the landing ships and troop carriers during the [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] campaign. In this role they provided air cover for the troopships and flew the first wave of attacks on beach fortifications in amphibious landing operations. On occasion, they even escorted the large carriers, serving as emergency airstrips and providing fighter cover for their larger sisters while these were busy readying or refueling their own planes. They also transported aircraft and spare parts from the U.S. to remote island airstrips.\n\nThe [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought up an urgent need for [[aircraft carrier]]s, so some [[T3 tanker]]s were converted to escort carriers, {{USS|Suwannee}} is example of how a T3 tanker [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] AO-33 was rebuilt to be an escort carrier. The T3 tanker size and speed made the T3 a useful escort carrier. There were two classes of T3 hull carriers: ''Sangamon'' class and ''Commencement Bay'' class.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/us_esc3.htm World Aircraft Carriers List: US Escort Carriers, T3 Hulls ]</ref><ref>[http://drawings.usmaritimecommission.de/drawings_tanker.htm Outboard Profiles of Maritime Commission  Vessels, The Tanker Designs and her Conversions, All Drawings by Karsten-Kunibert Krueger-Kopiske 2007]</ref><ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/19/19105.htm navsource.org, USS Mispillion (AO-105) (1945\u20131975)]</ref>\n\n===Battle off Samar===\n[[File:LeyteGambierBayStraddle.jpg|right|thumb|{{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|6}}, burning from earlier gunfire damage, is bracketed by a salvo from a Japanese [[heavy cruiser]] (faintly visible in the background, center-right) shortly before sinking during the Battle off Samar.]]\n\nA major battle for these escort carriers was the [[Battle off Samar]] in the Philippines on 25 October 1944. The Japanese lured Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]] into chasing a decoy fleet with his [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]]. This left aircraft from 16 small and slow escort carriers in three task groups armed primarily to bomb ground forces; along with their protective screen of destroyers and slower [[destroyer escort]]s, with \"Taffy 3\" bearing the brunt of the fight. They faced a Japanese force of four [[battleship]]s, including the giant {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, eight [[cruiser]]s, and 11 destroyers. The American ships held off the Japanese.\n\nThe slow carriers could not outrun {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} cruisers. They launched their aircraft and maneuvered to avoid shellfire for over an hour. They took dozens of hits, mostly from armor-piercing rounds that passed right through their thin, unarmored hulls without exploding. {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|6}}, sunk in this action, was the only U.S. carrier lost to gunfire in the war, and the Japanese concentration of fire on this one carrier assisted the escape of the others. The carriers\u2032 only substantial armament\u2014aside from their aircraft\u2014was a single 5 in (127&nbsp;mm) [[dual-purpose gun]] mounted on the stern, but the pursuing Japanese cruisers closed to within range of these guns. One of the guns caused critical damage to the burning Japanese heavy cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Ch\u014dkai||2}} and a subsequent bomb dropped from one of the task force\u2032s aircraft hit the heavy cruiser\u2032s forward machinery room, leaving her dead in the water. Several ''kamikaze'' aircraft were shot down by carrier gunners, with only {{USS|St Lo|CVE-63|6}} lost to air attack. The Americans lost a similar number of ships and men to the [[Battle of Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway]] combined.\n\n[[File:Gambierbaymodel.jpg|thumb|Model of ''Gambier Bay'' at [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway'' museum]]]]\n\n==The ships==\n{{main|list of escort carriers by country}}\nMany escort carriers were [[Lend-Lease]]d to the [[United Kingdom]], this list specifies the breakdown in service to each navy.\n\n*{{sclass-|Long Island|escort carrier|4}}: Two ships, one in USN service ({{USS|Long Island|CVE-1|6}}) and one in British service ({{HMS|Archer|D78|6}}).\n*{{sclass-|Avenger|escort carrier|4}}: Four ships, one mainly in USN service (as {{USS|Charger|CVE-30|6}}) and three in British service.\n*{{sclass-|Sangamon|escort carrier|4}}: Four ships, all in USN service.\n*{{sclass-|Bogue|escort carrier|4}}: 45 ships, 11 in USN service, 34 in British service as ''Attacker'' class (first group) and ''Ruler'' class (second group).\n*{{sclass-|Casablanca|escort carrier|4}}: 50 ships, all in USN service.\n*{{sclass-|Commencement Bay|escort carrier|4}}: 19 ships, all in USN service, including two that were accepted but not commissioned and laid up for many years after the war.

Although several of the latest ''Commencement Bay''-class CVE were deployed as floating airfields during the [[Korean War]], the main reasons for the development of the escort carrier had disappeared or could be dealt with better by newer weapons. The emergence of the helicopter meant that helicopter-deck equipped [[frigate]]s could now take over the CVE's role in a convoy while also performing their own traditional role as submarine hunters. Ship-mounted [[guided missile]] launchers took over much of the aircraft protection role, and [[in-flight refueling]] abolished the need for floating stopover points for transport or patrol aircraft. As a result, after the ''Commencement Bay'' class, no new escort carriers were designed, and with every downsizing of the navy, the CVEs were the first to be mothballed.\n\nSeveral escort carriers were pressed back into service during the first years of the [[Vietnam War]] because of their ability to carry large numbers of aircraft. Redesignated AKV (air transport auxiliary), they were manned by a civilian crew and used to ferry whole aircraft and spare parts from the U.S. to Army, Air Force and Marine bases in [[South Vietnam]]. However, CVEs were useful in this role only for a limited period. Once all major aircraft were equipped with refueling probes, it became much easier to fly the aircraft directly to its base instead of shipping it overseas.\n\nThe last chapter in the history of escort carriers consisted of two conversions: As an experiment, {{USS|Thetis Bay|CVE-90|6}} was converted from an aircraft carrier into a pure [[helicopter carrier]] (CVHA-1) and used by the Marine Corps to carry assault helicopters for the first wave of [[amphibious warfare]] operations. Later, ''Thetis Bay'' became a full amphibious assault ship (LHP-6). Although in service only from 1955 (the year of her conversion) to 1964, the experience gained in her training exercises greatly influenced the design of today\u2032s [[amphibious assault ship]]s.\n\nIn the second conversion, in 1961, {{USS|Gilbert Islands|CVE-107|6}} had all her aircraft handling equipment removed and four tall radio antennas installed on her long, flat deck. In lieu of aircraft, the hangar deck now had no fewer than 24 military radio transmitter trucks bolted to its floor. Rechristened {{USS|Annapolis|AGMR-1|6}}, the ship was used as a communication relay ship and served dutifully through the Vietnam War as a floating radio station, relaying transmissions between the forces on the ground and the command centers back home. Like ''Thetis Bay'', the experience gained before ''Annapolis'' was stricken in 1976 helped develop today\u2032s purpose-built [[amphibious command ship]]s of the {{sclass-|Blue Ridge|command ship|4}}.\n\nUnlike almost all other major classes of ships and patrol boats from World War II, most of which can be found in a museum or port, no escort carrier or American [[Light aircraft carrier|light carrier]] has survived: all were destroyed during the war or broken up in the following decades. The [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] records that the last former escort carrier remaining in naval service \u2014 USS ''Annapolis'' (ex- USS ''Gilbert Islands'') \u2014 was sold for scrapping 19 December 1979. The last American light carrier (the escort carrier\u2032s faster sister type) was {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|6}}, which was broken up in 2002 after a decade-long attempt to preserve the vessel.\n\nThe U.S. designed the [[Sea Control Ship]]<ref name=\"Sea Control Ship\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/scs.htm Sea Control Ship] \u2013 GlobalSecurity.org</ref> to serve a similar role; whilst none were actually built, the [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|Spanish ''Principe de Asturias'']] and the Thai [[HTMS Chakri Naruebet|''Chakri Naruebet'']] are based on the concept.\n\n==See also==\n*[[CAM ship]]\n*[[Merchant aircraft carrier]]\n\nFor complete lists see:\n*[[List of escort carriers by country]]\n*[[List of United States Navy escort aircraft carriers]]\n*[[List of sunken aircraft carriers]]\n*[[List of escort carriers of the Royal Navy]]\n*[[List of ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy]]\n*[[List of aircraft carriers of World War II]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Adcock, Al (1996).

In addition, beginning extreme athletes tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).\n\nActivities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional [[sport]]s due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.\n\nIn a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for [[snowboard]]ers, rock and ice quality for [[climbing|climbers]], and wave height and shape for [[surfing|surfers]].\n\nWhilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.<ref>Jungmin Lee (2004), [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ecm/nasm04/122.html Extreme Sports Evaluation: Evidence from Judging Figure Skating, Econometric Society]</ref> This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/19/DI2006061900992.html|title='Adrenaline': Extreme Sports|accessdate=2008-07-11 | work=The Washington Post | first1=Jon | last1=Wile | first2=Sonny | last2=Amato | date=2006-06-21}}</ref> and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.\n\n==Classification==\nWhile the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tomlinson, Joe |title=Extreme Sports: In Search of the Ultimate Thrill |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-55297-992-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOne argument is that to qualify as an \"extreme sport\" '''both''' expression terms need to be fulfilled;\n* \"'''sport'''\": The participant has to dispose of considerable skill and/or physical ability to avoid ''poor execution of the activity'';\n* \"'''extreme'''\": ''poor execution of the activity'' has to result in considerable risk of serious physical harm to the participant;\n\nAlong this definition, an activity such as [[bungee jumping]] may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution).

They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day [[bungee jumping]], by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], [[Bristol, England]]. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the [[Royal Gorge]] Suspension Bridge in [[Colorado]], sponsored by and televised on the popular [[United States|American]] television program ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' [[Bungee jumping]] was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.\nThe Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London [[double-decker bus]], wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.\n\nOther Club activities included expedition [[hang gliding]] from active [[volcano]]es; the launching of giant (60&nbsp;ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre ([[zorbing]]); [[microlight]] flying; and [[BASE jumping]] (in the early days of this sport).\n\nIn recent decades the term ''extreme sport'' was further promoted after the [[Extreme Sports Channel]], Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |title=extreme sports |year=2007 |publisher=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023120444/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15836448.html |title=Generation Ex \u2013 the Extreme Games, a competition for people with exceptional athletic talents |year=1994 |author=Josh Krulewitz |work=American Fitness |via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref> The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Mount Snow]], and [[Vermont]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |title=Extreme Sports \u2013 Encarta |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc2bMeg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name=AboutXGames>{{cite web|url=http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |title=About International X Games |year=2002 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829202819/http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\nCertain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, [[windsurfing]] was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a [[surfing|surfboard]] with a [[Sailing|sailing boat's]] propulsion system (mast and sail). [[Kitesurfing]] on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of [[kite buggying]] (a [[parafoil]]) with the bi-directional boards used for [[wakeboarding]]. [[Wakeboarding]] is in turn derived from [[snowboarding]] and [[waterskiing]].\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Hanggliding03042006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hang glider]] launching from [[Mount Tamalpais]]]]\nSome contend<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DD133DF93BA35751C0A96E958260 \"Extreme Sport, Extreme Chic, Extreme Hype\"], ''New York Times'', February 8, 1998.</ref> that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated.

910 \u2013 26 January 946), a member of the [[House of Wessex]], was [[List of German queens|German queen]] from 936 until her death, by her marriage with King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]].\n\n==Life==\nEdith was born to the reigning [[Kingdom of England|English]] king [[Edward the Elder]] by his second wife, [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], and hence was a granddaughter of King [[Alfred the Great]]. In 919 her sister [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]] married the [[West Francia|West Frankish]] king [[Charles the Simple]]. Nothing is known of Edith until at the request of the [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king [[Henry the Fowler]], who wished to stake a claim to equality and to seal the alliance between the two Saxon kingdoms, her half-brother King [[\u00c6thelstan]] sent his sisters Edith and Edgiva to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. Henry's eldest son and heir to the throne Otto was instructed to choose whichever one pleased him best. Otto chose Edith, according to [[Hrotsvitha|Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim]] a woman \"of pure noble countenance, graceful character and truly royal appearance\", and married her in 930. The remaining sister Edgiva was married to a \"king near the Jupiter mountains\" (the [[Alps]]), probably to Louis, brother of King [[Rudolph II of Burgundy]]. The precise identity of the husband of this sister is debated.\n[[File:Ankunft Ottos I. und Ediths in Magdeburg.jpg|thumb|left|Otto I and his wife Edith arrive near Magdeburg (Hugo Vogel 1898, St\u00e4ndehaus Merseburg)]]\nIn 936 Henry the Fowler died and his eldest son Otto, Edith's husband, was crowned king at [[Aachen Cathedral]]. A surviving report of the ceremony by the medieval cronicler [[Widukind of Corvey]] makes no mention of his wife having been crowned at this point, but according to Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]]'s chronicle, Eadgyth was nevertheless [[Anointing|anointed]] as queen, albeit in a separate ceremony. \n\nAs queen consort, Edith undertook the usual state duties of a \"First Lady\": when she turns up in the records it is generally in connection with gifts to the state's [[List of Imperial abbeys|favoured monasteries]] or memorials to holy women and saints. In this respect she seems to have been more diligent than her now widowed and subsequently sainted mother-in-law, Queen [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Matilda]], whose own charitable activities only achieve a single recorded mention from the period of Eadgyth's time as queen. There was probably rivalry between the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[:de:Mauritiuskloster|Monastery of St Maurice]] founded at [[Magdeburg]] by Otto and Eadgyth in 937, a year after coming to the throne, and Matilda's foundation [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], intended by her as a memorial to her husband, the late King Henry. Edith accompanied her husband on his travels, though not during battles. While Otto fought against the rebellious dukes [[Eberhard of Franconia]] and [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert of Lorraine]] in 939, she spent the hostilities at [[Lorsch Abbey]].\n\nLike her brother, \u00c6thelstan, Edith was devoted to the cult of their ancestor Saint [[Oswald of Northumbria]] and was instrumental in introducing this cult into Germany after her marriage to the emperor. Her lasting influence may have caused certain monasteries and churches in the [[Duchy of Saxony]] to be dedicated to this saint.<ref name=\"GuardianEadgyth20Jan10\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jan/20/alfred-great-granddaughter-remains-wessex|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=20 January 2010|title=Remains of Alfred the Great's granddaughter returned / Coming home: the Saxon queen lost for 1,000 years|pages=5|accessdate=20 January 2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nEadgyth's death in 946 at a relatively young age, in her thirties, was unexpected.

[[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|\u00c6thelberht]] (King of Kent and overlord of southern England according to Bede) was in a position to exercise some authority in Essex shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King [[Saebert of Essex]] (son of [[Sledda|Sledd]]), his nephew, to Christianity. It was \u00c6thelberht, and not S\u00e6berht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where [[St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral]] now stands. Bede describes \u00c6thelberht as S\u00e6berht\u2019s overlord.<ref>Bede, book II, chapter 3</ref><ref name=Stenton_109>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 109.</ref> After the death of [[Saebert of Essex|Saebert]] in AD 616, Mellitus was driven out and the kingdom reverted to paganism. This may have been the result of opposition to Kentish influence in Essex affairs rather than being specifically anti-Christian.<ref name=\"Yorke, Barbara 1990\">Yorke, Barbara, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (1990)</ref>\n\nThe kingdom reconverted to Christianity under [[Sigeberht II of Essex|Sigeberht II the Good]] following a mission by [[Cedd|St Cedd]] who established monasteries at ''Tilaburg'' (probably [[East Tilbury]], but possibly [[West Tilbury]]) and ''Ithancester'' (almost certainly [[Bradwell-on-Sea]]). A [[Royal saxon tomb in Prittlewell|royal tomb]] at Prittlewell was discovered and excavated in 2003. Finds included gold foil crosses, suggesting the occupant was Christian. If the occupant was a king, it was probably either Saebert or Sigeberht (murdered AD 653). It is, however, also possible that the occupant was not royal, but simply a wealthy and powerful individual whose identity has gone unrecorded.<ref>Blair, I. 2007. Prittlewell Prince. ''Current Archaeology'' '''207''': 8-11</ref>\n\nEssex reverted to Paganism again in 660 with the ascension of the Pagan King [[Swithelm of Essex]]. He converted in 662, but died in 664. He was succeeded by his two sons, [[Sighere of Essex|Sigehere]] and [[Sebbi of Essex|S\u00e6bbi]]. A plague the same year caused Sigehere and his people to recant their Christianity and Essex reverted to Paganism a third time. This rebellion was suppressed by [[Wulfhere of Mercia]] who established himself as overlord. Bede describes Sigehere and S\u00e6bbi as \"rulers \u2026 under Wulfhere, king of the Mercians\".<ref name=Kirby_114_1>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p.&nbsp;114.</ref> Wulfhere sent Jaruman, the bishop of [[Lichfield]], to reconvert the East Saxons.<ref>Bede, ''HE'', III, 30, pp. 200\u20131.</ref>\n\n[[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] (in 666)<ref name=Handbook239>Fryde, et al.

For a brief period in the 8th century the kingdom encompassed the Kentish Kingdom to the South.

The eighth-century monk [[Bede]], in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', lists him as the third king to hold ''imperium'' over other [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]. In the late ninth century ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', he is referred to as a [[bretwalda]], or \"Britain-ruler\". He was the first English king to convert to [[Christianity]].\n\n\u00c6thelberht was the son of [[Eormenric of Kent|Eormenric]], succeeding him as king, according to the ''Chronicle''. He married [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], the Christian daughter of [[Charibert]], king of the [[Franks]], thus building an alliance with the [[Francia|most powerful state]] in contemporary Western Europe; the marriage probably took place before he came to the throne. Bertha's influence may have led to [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory I's]] decision to send [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] as a [[missionary]] from Rome. Augustine landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] in east Kent in 597. Shortly thereafter, \u00c6thelberht converted to Christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom. He provided the new church with land in [[Canterbury]], thus establishing one of the foundation stones of what ultimately became the [[Anglican Communion]].\n\n[[\u00c6thelberht's law]] for Kent, the earliest written code in any [[Germanic language]], instituted a complex system of fines; the law code is preserved in the [[Textus Roffensis]]. Kent was rich, with strong trade ties to the continent, and \u00c6thelberht may have instituted royal control over trade. Coinage probably began circulating in Kent during his reign for the first time since the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement]]. He later came to be [[canonization|regarded as a saint]] for his role in establishing Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons. His [[feast day]] was originally 24 February but was changed to 25 February.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:England green top.svg|thumb|300px|right|The state of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] at the time \u00c6thelberht came to the throne of Kent]]\n\nIn the fifth century, raids on Britain by continental peoples had developed into full-scale migrations. The newcomers are known to have included [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]] and [[Frisii|Frisians]], and there is evidence of other groups as well. These groups captured territory in the east and south of England, but at about the end of the fifth century, a British victory at the battle of [[Battle of Badon|Mount Badon]] (Mons Badonicus) halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for fifty years.<ref name=Blair_IASE_13>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', pp. 13\u201316.</ref><ref name=Campbell_TAS_23>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 23.</ref> From about 550, however, the British began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders.<ref name=Blair_RBaEE_204>Peter Hunter Blair (''Roman Britain'', p. 204) gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest.</ref>\n\nAnglo-Saxons probably conquered Kent before Mons Badonicus. There is both documentary and archaeological evidence that Kent was primarily colonised by Jutes, from the southern part of the [[Jutland]] peninsula.<ref name=Yorke_26>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 26.</ref> According to legend, the brothers [[Hengist]] and Horsa landed in 449 as mercenaries for a British king, [[Vortigern]]. After a rebellion over pay and Horsa's death in battle, Hengist established the [[Kingdom of Kent]].<ref name=Swanton_12>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 12\u201313.</ref> Some historians now think the underlying story of a rebelling mercenary force may be accurate; most now date the founding of the kingdom of Kent to the middle of the fifth-century, which is consistent with the legend.{{#tag:ref|There is disagreement about the extent to which the legend can be treated as fact. For example, Yorke says \"Recent detailed studies [. . .] have confirmed that these accounts are largely mythic and that any reliable oral tradition which they may have embodied has been lost in the conventions of the origin-legend format\",<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 26</ref> but Fletcher says of Hengist that \"there is no good reason for doubting his existence\",<ref>Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', pp. 15\u201317</ref> and Campbell adds that \"although the origins of such annals are deeply mysterious, and suspect, they cannot be simply discarded\".<ref name=Campbell_TAS_38>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 38.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} This early date, only a few decades after the departure of the Romans, also suggests that more of Roman civilization may have survived into Anglo-Saxon rule in Kent than in other areas.<ref name=Campbell_TAS_38 />\n\nOverlordship was a central feature of Anglo-Saxon politics which began before \u00c6thelberht's time; kings were described as overlords as late as the ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; [[\u00c6lle of Sussex]] may have been such a leader.<ref>Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', pp. 15\u201317.</ref> Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began.

Bede was interested primarily in England's [[Christianization]]. Since \u00c6thelberht was the first Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity, Bede provides more substantial information about him than about any earlier king. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed [[St Augustine's Abbey|St. Augustine's]]) in [[Canterbury]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a collection of annals assembled c. 890 in the kingdom of [[Wessex]], mentions several events in Kent during \u00c6thelberht's reign.<ref name=Yorke_25>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 25.</ref> Further mention of events in Kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the [[Franks]] by [[Gregory of Tours]]. This is the earliest surviving source to mention any Anglo-Saxon kingdom.<ref name=Kirby_30>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 30.</ref> Some of Pope [[Gregory the Great]]'s letters concern the mission of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine]] to Kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours. Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). Although no originals survive from \u00c6thelberht's reign, later copies exist. A law code from \u00c6thelberht's reign also survives.<ref name=Yorke_25 />\n\n==Ancestry, accession and chronology==\nAccording to Bede, \u00c6thelberht was descended directly from Hengist. Bede gives the line of descent as follows: \"Ethelbert was son of Irminric, son of Octa, and after his grandfather Oeric, surnamed Oisc, the kings of the Kentish folk are commonly known as Oiscings. The father of Oeric was Hengist.\"<ref name=Bede_112>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book II, Ch. 5, from Sherley-Price's translation, p. 112.</ref> An alternative form of this genealogy, found in the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' among other places, reverses the position of Octa and Oisc in the lineage.<ref name=Yorke_26 /> The first of these names that can be placed historically with reasonable confidence is \u00c6thelberht's father, whose name now usually is spelled Eormenric. The only direct written reference to Eormenric is in Kentish genealogies, but Gregory of Tours does mention that \u00c6thelberht's father was the king of Kent, though Gregory gives no date. Eormenric's name provides a hint of connections to the kingdom of the Franks, across the English channel; the element \"[[Irmin (disambiguation)|Eormen]]\" was rare in names of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy, but much more common among Frankish nobles.<ref name=Yorke_28>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 28.</ref> One other member of \u00c6thelberht's family is known: his sister, Ricole, who is recorded by both Bede and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' as the mother of [[S\u00e6berht of Essex|S\u00e6berht]], [[Kingdom of Essex|king of the East Saxons]] (i.e. Essex).<ref name=\"Swanton_12\" /><ref name=\"Bede_108\">Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book II, Ch. 3, from Sherley-Price's translation, p. 108.</ref>\n\nThe dates of \u00c6thelberht's birth and accession to the throne of Kent are both matters of debate. Bede, the earliest source to give dates, is thought to have drawn his information from correspondence with Albinus. Bede states that when \u00c6thelberht died in 616 he had reigned for fifty-six years, placing his accession in 560. Bede also says that \u00c6thelberht died twenty-one years after his baptism. Augustine\u2019s mission from Rome is known to have arrived in 597, and according to Bede, it was this mission that converted \u00c6thelberht.<ref name=Bede_74>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book I, Ch. 25 & 26, from Sherley-Price's translation, pp. 74\u201377.</ref> Hence Bede\u2019s dates are inconsistent. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', an important source for early dates, is inconsistent with Bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions. Putting together the different dates in the ''Chronicle'' for birth, death and length of reign, it appears that \u00c6thelberht's reign was thought to have been either 560\u2013616 or 565\u2013618 but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions.<ref name=Kirby_31>Kirby (''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 31\u20133) provides an extended discussion of the difficult chronology of \u00c6thelberht's reign.</ref>\n\nIt is possible that \u00c6thelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. \u00c6thelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so \u00c6thelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also is possible that Bede had the date of \u00c6thelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, \u00c6thelberht died in 618, this would be consistent with his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.<ref name=Kirby_31 />\n\nGregory of Tours, in his ''Historia Francorum'', writes that [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert]], king of the Franks, married the son of the king of Kent. Bede says that \u00c6thelberht received Bertha \"from her parents\". If Bede is interpreted literally, the marriage would have had to take place before 567, when Charibert died. The traditions for \u00c6thelberht's reign, then, would imply that \u00c6thelberht married Bertha before either 560 or 565.<ref name=Bede_74/><ref name=Kirby_31 />\n\nThe extreme length of \u00c6thelberht's reign also has been regarded with skepticism by historians; it has been suggested that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and \u00c6thelberht also solve another possible problem: \u00c6thelberht's daughter, [[\u00c6thelburh of Kent|\u00c6thelburh]], seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at \u00c6thelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.<ref name=Kirby_31 />\n\nGregory, however, also says that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert. This is possible, but seems unlikely, especially as Charibert seems to have had a preference for younger women, again according to Gregory's account. This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha. On the other hand, Gregory refers to \u00c6thelberht at the time of his marriage to Bertha simply as \"a man of Kent\", and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg's death, which was written in about 590 or 591, he refers to \u00c6thelberht as \"the son of the king of Kent\". If this does not simply reflect Gregory's ignorance of Kentish affairs, which seems unlikely given the close ties between Kent and the Franks, then some assert that \u00c6thelberht's reign cannot have begun before 589.<ref name=Kirby_31 /><ref name=GTours>IV 25 and IX 25 in {{cite book |author= Gregory of Tours|title= The History of the Franks|pages=219, 513|year= 1974|publisher= Penguin|isbn=0-14-044295-2}}</ref>\n\nWhile all of the contradictions above cannot be reconciled, the most probable dates that may be drawn from available data place \u00c6thelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, perhaps, his marriage to Bertha at 580. His reign is most likely to have begun in 589 or 590.<ref name=Kirby_31 />\n\n==Kingship of Kent==\nThe later history of Kent shows clear evidence of a system of joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. This evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that \u00c6thelberht ruled as joint king with his son, [[Eadbald of Kent|Eadbald]]. It may be that \u00c6thelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history. Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with \u00c6thelberht, there is no question that \u00c6thelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.<ref name=Yorke_3234>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 32\u201334.</ref>\n\nThe division into two kingdoms is most likely to date back to the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom. This was a common pattern in Anglo-Saxon England, as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.<ref name=Yorke_3234 />\n\nThe main towns of the two kingdoms were Rochester, for west Kent, and Canterbury, for east Kent. Bede does not state that \u00c6thelberht had a palace in Canterbury, but he does refer to Canterbury as \u00c6thelberht's \"metropolis\", and it is clear that it is \u00c6thelberht's seat.<ref name=Yorke_3234 /><ref name=Campbell_TAS_38_2>Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 38\u201339.</ref>\n\n==Relations with the Franks==\n[[File:Aethelberht of Kent sculpture on Canterbury Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of \u00c6thelberht on Canterbury Cathedral in England]]There are many indications of close relations between Kent and the Franks. \u00c6thelberht's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts, although not as equals: the Franks would have thought of \u00c6thelberht as an under-king. There is no record that \u00c6thelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on the true nature of the relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to [[Theuderic II|Theuderic]], king of [[Orl\u00e9ans]], and [[Theudebert II|Theudebert]], king of [[Metz]]. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes \"that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand\". It may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. It also has been suggested that Liudhard, Bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.<ref name=Stenton_59>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 59\u201360.</ref><ref name=Kirby_34>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nA possible reason for the willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, [[Chilperic I]], is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it may be that the marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people.<ref name=Stenton_59 /> Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that \u00c6thelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.<ref name=Kirby_34 />\n\nRegardless of the political relationship between \u00c6thelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods than those of the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the [[English Channel]]. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade.<ref name=Yorke_26 /> Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent.<ref name=Stenton_59 /> Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so it is not necessary to presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.<ref name=Yorke_26 />\n\n==Rise to dominance==\n\n===Bretwalda===\n[[Image:Entry for 827 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which lists the eight bretwaldas.gif|thumb|right|The entry for 827 in the [C] ms. (one of the [[Abingdon manuscripts]]) of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', listing the eight ''bretwaldas''; \u00c6thelberht's name, spelled \"\u00c6\u00feelbriht\", is the second-to-last word on the fifth line]]\n\nIn his ''Ecclesiastical History'', Bede includes his list of seven kings who held \"imperium\" over the other kingdoms south of the Humber. The usual translation for \"imperium\" is \"overlordship\". Bede names \u00c6thelberht as the third on the list, after \u00c6lle of Sussex and [[Ceawlin of Wessex]].<ref name=Bede_111>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book I, Ch. 25 & 26, from Sherley-Price's translation, p. 111.</ref> The anonymous annalist who composed one of the versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' repeated Bede's list of seven kings in a famous entry under the year 827, with one additional king, Egbert of Wessex. The ''Chronicle'' also records that these kings held the title \"''bretwalda''\", or \"Britain-ruler\".<ref name=Swanton_60>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 60\u201361.</ref> The exact meaning of ''bretwalda'' has been the subject of much debate; it has been described as a term \"of encomiastic poetry\",<ref name=Stenton_34>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 34\u201335.</ref> but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.<ref name=Kirby_17>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe prior ''bretwalda'', Ceawlin, is recorded by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' as having fought \u00c6thelberht in 568. The entry states that \u00c6thelberht lost the battle and was driven back to Kent.<ref name=Swanton_18>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 18\u201319.</ref> The dating of the entries concerning the West Saxons in this section of the ''Chronicle'' is thought to be unreliable and a recent analysis suggests that Ceawlin's reign is more likely to have been approximately 581\u2013588, rather than the dates of 560\u2013592 that are given in the ''Chronicle''.<ref name=Kirby_50>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 50\u201351.</ref><ref name=Yorke_133>D.N. Dumville, \"The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List and the chronology of Wessex\", 1985, cited in Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 133.</ref> The battle was at \"Wibbandun\", which may be translated as Wibba's Mount; it is not known where this was.<ref name=Swanton_18 />\n\nAt some point Ceawlin ceased to hold the title of ''bretwalda'', perhaps after a battle at Stoke Lyne, in Oxfordshire, which the ''Chronicle'' dates to 584, some eight years before he was deposed in 592 (again using the ''Chronicle's'' unreliable dating).<ref name=Stenton_59 /> \u00c6thelberht certainly was a dominant ruler by 601, when Gregory the Great wrote to him: Gregory urges \u00c6thelberht to spread Christianity among those kings and peoples subject to him, implying some level of overlordship.<ref name=Kirby_37>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 37.</ref> If the battle of Wibbandun was fought c. 590, as has been suggested, then \u00c6thelberht must have gained his position as overlord at some time in the 590s. This dating for Wibbandun is slightly inconsistent with the proposed dates of 581\u2013588 for Ceawlin's reign, but those dates are not thought to be precise, merely the most plausible given the available data.<ref name=Yorke_133 />\n\n===Relationships with other kingdoms===\nIn addition to the evidence of the ''Chronicle'' that \u00c6thelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda, there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the [[Heptarchy]]. In Essex, \u00c6thelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King [[S\u00e6berht of Essex]], his nephew, to Christianity. It was \u00c6thelberht, and not S\u00e6berht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where [[St Paul's Cathedral]] now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes \u00c6thelberht as S\u00e6berht's overlord.<ref name=Bede_108 /><ref name=Kirby_37 /><ref name=Stenton_109>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 109.</ref>\n\nBede describes \u00c6thelberht's relationship with [[R\u00e6dwald]], king of [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], in a passage that is not completely clear in meaning. It seems to imply that R\u00e6dwald retained ducatus, or military command of his people, even while \u00c6thelberht held imperium.<ref name=Bede_111 /> This implies that being a bretwalda usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it was more than that, since \u00c6thelberht is bretwalda despite R\u00e6dwald's control of his own troops.<ref name=Kirby_17 /> R\u00e6dwald was converted to Christianity while in Kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs; this, together with the fact that he retained military independence, implies that \u00c6thelberht's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons.<ref name=Kirby_37 /><ref name=Yorke_62>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 62.</ref> An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as \"R\u00e6dwald, king of the East Angles, who while \u00c6thelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people\"; if this is Bede's intent, then East Anglia firmly was under \u00c6thelberht's overlordship.<ref name=Blackwell_13_Higham>\"R\u00e6dwald\", N. J. Higham, in Lapidge, ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''.</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence that \u00c6thelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly due to the lack of sources\u2014nothing is known of [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]'s history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries.<ref name=Yorke_20>For example, Yorke comments that \"it is impossible to write at any length about the history of [Sussex] in the seventh and eighth centuries\" (''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 20).</ref> \u00c6thelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley, on the northwestern borders of [[Wessex]], however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west.<ref name=Kirby_37 /> No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of [[Mercia]], but it is known that Mercia was independent of [[Northumbria]], so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.<ref name=Stenton_39>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 39.</ref>\n\n==Augustine's mission and early Christianisation==\n[[File:Ethelbert, King of Kent from All Souls College Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stained-glass window of \u00c6thelberht from the chapel of [[All Souls College, Oxford]]]]\nThe native Britons had converted to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so the church in Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs.<ref name=Kirby_36>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 36.</ref><ref name=Stenton_110>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 110.</ref> However, \u00c6thelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom \u00c6thelberht built a chapel, [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury|St Martin's]].<ref name=Kirby_35>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 35.</ref>\n\nIn 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] in Kent.<ref name=Kirby_30 /> According to Bede, \u00c6thelberht was sufficiently distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open sky, to prevent them from performing sorcery. The monks impressed \u00c6thelberht, but he was not converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.<ref name=Bede_74 />\n\nIt is not known when \u00c6thelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already was a Christian before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed \u00c6thelberht to consider becoming a Christian before the arrival of the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of \u00c6thelberht's marriage to Bertha was that \u00c6thelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that \u00c6thelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control.<ref name=Yorke_2829>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref> It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation\u2014he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission\u2014is an indication that \u00c6thelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.<ref name=Kirby_35 />\n\nAt the latest, \u00c6thelberht must have converted before 601, since that year Gregory wrote to him as a Christian king.<ref name=Kirby_37 /> An old tradition records that \u00c6thelberht converted on 1 June, in the summer of the year that Augustine arrived.<ref name=Blair_IASE_117>Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', p. 117.</ref> Through \u00c6thelberht's influence S\u00e6berht, king of Essex, also was converted,<ref name=\"Stenton_109\" /> but there were limits to the effectiveness of the mission. The entire Kentish court did not convert: Eadbald, \u00c6thelberht's son and heir, was a pagan at his accession.<ref name=\"Kirby_36\" /> R\u00e6dwald, king of East Anglia, was only partly converted (apparently while at \u00c6thelberht's court) and retained a pagan shrine next to the new Christian altar.<ref name=\"Bede_112\" /><ref name=\"Kirby_36\" /> Augustine also was unsuccessful in gaining the allegiance of the British clergy.<ref name=\"Stenton_110\" />\n\n==Law code==\n[[Image:Textus Roffensis ms.png|thumb|200px|right|The first page of the twelfth-century manuscript of \u00c6thelberht's law code]]\n{{main article|Law of \u00c6thelberht}}\nSome time after the arrival of Augustine's mission, perhaps in 602 or 603, \u00c6thelberht issued a set of laws, in ninety sections.<ref name=Blackwell_13_Kelly>\"\u00c6thelberht\", S.E.

Bede asserted that they were composed \"after the Roman manner\", but there is little discernible Roman influence either. In subject matter, the laws have been compared to the [[Lex Salica]] of the Franks, but it is not thought that \u00c6thelberht based his new code on any specific previous model.<ref name=Stenton_59 /><ref name=Blackwell_13_Kelly />\n\nThe laws are concerned with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions at all levels of society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim. The king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would come to him in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding [[blood feud]]s by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control.<ref name=Yorke_18>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 18.</ref> \u00c6thelberht's laws are mentioned by [[Alfred the Great]], who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by \u00c6thelberht, as well as those of [[Offa of Mercia]] and [[Ine of Wessex]].<ref name=Stenton_276>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 276.</ref>\n\nOne of \u00c6thelberht's laws seems to preserve a trace of a very old custom: the third item in the code states that \"If the king is drinking at a man's home, and anyone commits any evil deed there, he is to pay twofold compensation.\"<ref name=Geary_209 /> This probably refers to the ancient custom of a king traveling the country, being hosted, and being provided for by his subjects wherever he went. The king's servants retained these rights for centuries after \u00c6thelberht's time.<ref name=Stenton_288>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nItems 77\u201381 in the code have been interpreted as a description of a woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.<ref name=ASE23/>\n\n==Trade and coinage==\n[[Image:Eadbaldobv.1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A thrymsa from the reign of Eadbald, \u00c6thelberht's son, none of the coins are known to carry \u00c6thelberht's name, although they may have been minted during his reign]]\n\nThere is little documentary evidence about the nature of trade in \u00c6thelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of \u00c6thelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.<ref name=Yorke_40>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 40.</ref>\n\nKentish manufacture before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers were highly skilled, and before the end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the [[Loire]]. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of \u00c6thelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.<ref name=Campbell_TAS_44 />\n\nIt may have been during \u00c6thelberht's reign that the first coins were minted in England since the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the Romans]]: none bear his name, but it is thought likely that the first coins predate the end of the sixth century.<ref name=Yorke_40 /> These early coins were gold, and probably were the shillings ({{lang|ang|scillingas}} in Old English) that are mentioned in \u00c6thelberht's laws.<ref name=BG_157>Blackburn & Grierson, ''Early Medieval Coinage'', p.&nbsp;157.</ref> The coins are also known to [[numismatics|numismatists]] as \"thrymsas\".<ref name=Blackwell_113>\"Coinage\", M.A.S. Blackburn, in Lapidge, ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''.</ref>\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:Ethelbert King Kent.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of \u00c6thelberht with Canterbury Cathedral in the background]]\n\u00c6thelberht died on 24 February 616 and was succeeded by his son, [[Eadbald of Kent|Eadbald]], who was not a Christian\u2014Bede says he had been converted but went back to his pagan faith,<ref name=Blackwell_13_Kelly /> although he ultimately did become a Christian king.<ref name=Stenton_61>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 61.</ref> Eadbald outraged the church by marrying his stepmother, which was contrary to Church law, and by refusing to accept baptism.<ref name=\"Bede_112\"/> S\u00e6berht of the East Saxons also died at approximately this time, and he was succeeded by his three sons, none of whom were Christian. A subsequent revolt against Christianity and the expulsion of the missionaries from Kent may have been a reaction to Kentish overlordship after \u00c6thelberht's death as much as a pagan opposition to Christianity.<ref name=\"Yorke_48\">Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Eadbald, it is possible that \u00c6thelberht had another son, \u00c6thelwald. The evidence for this is a papal letter to Justus, archbishop of Canterbury from 619 to 625, that refers to a king named Aduluald, who is apparently different from Audubald, which refers to Eadbald. There is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this: \"Aduluald\" might be intended as a representation of \"\u00c6thelwald\", and hence an indication of another king, perhaps a sub-king of west Kent;<ref name=Yorke_3233>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 32\u201333.</ref> or it may be merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to Eadbald.<ref name=Kirby_39>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 39.</ref>\n\n==Liturgical celebration==\n\u00c6thelberht was later regarded as a saint for his role in establishing [[Christianity]] among the Anglo-Saxons.

It went without saying as it were.\" And in another place at about this same time: \"Our creed is indeed a queer creed.

He has not only set the problem but also has devised the rules of the game--but they are not completely known, half of them are left for you to discover or deduce. I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but is ghastly silent about all that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously. I shall quite briefly mention here the notorious atheism of science. The theists reproach it for this again and again. Unjustly. A personal God cannot be encountered in a world picture that becomes accessible only at the price that everything personal is excluded from it. We know that whenever God is experienced, it is an experience exactly as real as a direct sense impression, as real as one's own personality. As such He must be missing from the space-time picture. \"I do not meet with God in space and time\", so says the honest scientific thinker, and for that reason he is reproached by those in whose catechism it is nevertheless stated: \"God is a Spirit.\" Whence came I and whither go I? That is the great unfathomable question, the same for every one of us. Science has no answer for it\"}}</ref> He also believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead, albeit in a metaphorical sense.<ref>[[#Moore|Moore]]: \"He rejected traditional religious beliefs (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic) not on the basis of any reasoned argument, nor even with an expression of emotional antipathy, for he loved to use religious expressions and metaphors, but simply by saying that they are naive.\" ... p. 4: \"He claimed to be an atheist, but he always used religious symbolism and believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead.\"</ref>\n\nHe was also able to learn English outside of school, as his maternal grandmother was British.<ref name=\"hof1\">{{cite book|author=Hoffman, D.|title= \u042d\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043d \u0428\u0440\u0451\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440|publisher= \u041c\u0438\u0440 |year=1987 |pages= 13\u201317}}</ref> Between 1906 and 1910 Schr\u00f6dinger studied in Vienna under [[Franz S.

He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich \"Fritz\" Kohlrausch.\n\nIn 1911, Schr\u00f6dinger became an assistant to Exner. At an early age, Schr\u00f6dinger was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply interested throughout his life in [[colour theory]] and philosophy. In his lecture \"Mind and Matter\", he said that \"The world extended in space and time is but our [[mental representation|representation]].\" This is a repetition of the first words of Schopenhauer's main work.\n\n===Middle years===\n[[File:Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg|thumb|upright|Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger as a young scientist]]\nIn 1914 Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger achieved [[Habilitation]] (''venia legendi''). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery ([[Gorizia]], [[Duino]], [[Sistiana]], Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to [[Max Wien]], in [[Jena]], and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (''ausserordentlicher Professor''), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in [[Stuttgart]]. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (''ordentlicher Professor'', i.e. full professor), in [[Breslau University|Breslau]] (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland).\n\nIn 1921, he moved to the [[University of Zurich|University of Z\u00fcrich]]. In 1927, he succeeded [[Max Planck]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin. In 1934, however, Schr\u00f6dinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis' anti-semitism. He became a Fellow of [[Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize together with [[Paul Dirac]]. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women,<ref>[[#Moore|Moore]], pp. 278 ff.</ref> were not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schr\u00f6dinger lectured at [[Princeton University]]; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it.

He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but retained his Austrian citizenship. He wrote about 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of [[classical unified field theories|unified field theory]].\n\nIn 1944, he wrote ''[[What Is Life?]]'', which contains a discussion of [[negentropy]] and the concept of a complex [[molecule]] with the genetic code for living [[organism]]s. According to [[James D. Watson]]'s memoir, ''[[DNA]], the Secret of Life'', Schr\u00f6dinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the [[gene]], which led to the discovery of the [[DNA]] [[double helix]] structure in 1953. Similarly, [[Francis Crick]], in his autobiographical book ''What Mad Pursuit'', described how he was influenced by Schr\u00f6dinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955. He had a lifelong interest in the [[Vedanta]] philosophy of [[Hinduism]], which influenced his speculations at the close of ''What Is Life?'' about the possibility that individual [[consciousness]] is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the [[universe]].<ref>Schr\u00f6dinger, Erwin.

At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. During this period Schr\u00f6dinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of [[wave\u2013particle duality]] and promoted the [[Wave\u2013particle duality#Wave-only view|wave idea alone]],{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} causing much controversy.\n\n===Personal life===\nOn 6 April 1920, Schr\u00f6dinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel.<ref>[[#Moore|Moore]] discusses Schr\u00f6dinger's unconventional relationships, including his affair with Hildegunde March, in chapters seven and eight, \"Berlin\" and \"Exile in Oxford\".</ref> Schr\u00f6dinger suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and several times in the 1920s stayed at a [[sanatorium]] in [[Arosa]].

He left Anny a widow, and was buried in [[Alpbach]], Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schr\u00f6dinger was a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]].<ref>[[#Moore|Moore]], p. 482: \"There was some problem about burial in the churchyard since Erwin was not a Catholic, but the priest relented when informed that he was a member in good standing of the Papal Academy, and a plot was made available at the edge of the Friedhof.\"</ref> His wife, Anny (born 3 December 1896) died on 3 October 1965.\n\n==Scientific activities==\n===Early career===\nEarly in his life, Schr\u00f6dinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz Exner. He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of [[Brownian movement]], and mathematical statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the ''Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism'', Schr\u00f6dinger wrote an article titled ''Dieelectrism''. That same year, Schr\u00f6dinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schr\u00f6dinger was awarded the 1920 [[Haitinger Prize]] (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.<ref name=\"Mehra\">Mehra, J. and Rechenberg, H.

Springer. {{ISBN|978-0-387-95179-9}}</ref> Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft beta-radiation appearing in the fall of gamma rays on the surface of metal. The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schr\u00f6dinger performed his last physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n====New quantum theory====\nIn the first years of his career Schr\u00f6dinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory, developed in the works of [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.\n\nThe first publications of Schr\u00f6dinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schr\u00f6dinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]] (1885\u20131955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year he created the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]], and [[John C. Slater|Slater]], which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). Although the experiments of [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Walther Bothe]] soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schr\u00f6dinger and he discussed it in some reports and publications.<ref name=jammer>''The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966; 2nd ed: New York: American Institute of Physics, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88318-617-9}}</ref>\n\n====Creation of wave mechanics====\nIn January 1926, Schr\u00f6dinger published in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' the paper \"{{Lang|de|Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem}}\" (Quantization as an [[Eigenvalue]] Problem)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schrodinger|first=Erwin|title=Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|year=1926|volume=384|issue=4|pages=273\u2013376|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19263840404/pdf|accessdate=7 April 2014|doi=10.1002/andp.19263840404|bibcode=1926AnP...384..361S}}</ref> on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. In this paper, he gave a \"derivation\" of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], [[rigid rotor]], and [[diatomic molecule]] problems and gave a new derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the [[Wave equation]] in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (This was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) When he introduced complex numbers in order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave mechanics was at his feet. (He eventually reduced the order to one.)<ref>''[[The Dreams That Stuff Is Made Of]]: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics\u2014and How They Shook the Scientific World'', [[Stephen Hawking]], (editor), the papers by Schrodinger.</ref> These papers were his central achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. Schr\u00f6dinger wrote about the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: \"I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/26/science/27eins_side.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=A Quantum Sampler | date=26 December 2005}}</ref>\n\n====Work on a unified field theory====\nFollowing his work on quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger devoted considerable effort to working on a [[Unified Field Theory]] that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework of General Relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein.<ref name= \"Halpern\">Halpern, Paul, [https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/battle-of-the-nobel-laureates-712d444610d3 Battle of the Nobel Laureates], April 2015 (accessed 2 April 2015).</ref> In 1947, he announced a result, \"Affine Field Theory,\"<ref>Schr\u00f6dinger, E., ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'', Vol. 51A (1947), [http://einstein-schrodinger.com/schrodingerI.html pp. 163\u2013171]. (accessed 3 November 2017)</ref> in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement was criticized by Einstein as \"preliminary\" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory.<ref name= \"Halpern\" /> Following the failure of his attempt at unification, Schr\u00f6dinger gave up his work on unification and turned to other topics.\n\n===Colour===\nSchr\u00f6dinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular [[colour perception]] and [[colorimetry]] (German: ''{{Lang|de|Farbenmetrik}}''). He spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and published a series of papers in this area:\n* \"Theorie der Pigmente von gr\u00f6\u00dfter Leuchtkraft\", ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'', (4), 62, (1920), 603\u201322 (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity)\n* \"Grundlinien einer Theorie der Farbenmetrik im Tagessehen\", ''Annalen der Physik'', (4), 63, (1920), 397\u2013456; 481\u2013520 (Outline of a theory of colour measurement for daylight vision)\n* \"Farbenmetrik\", ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'', 1, (1920), 459\u201366 (Colour measurement).\n* \"\u00dcber das Verh\u00e4ltnis der Vierfarben- zur Dreifarben-theorie\", ''Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Klasse'',{{clarify|date=November 2017|post-text=Which academy?}} 134, 471, (On The Relationship of Four-Color Theory to Three-Color Theory).\n* \"Lehre von der strahlenden Energie\", ''[[Johann Heinrich Jakob M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]]-[[Claude Pouillet|Pouillets]] Lehrbuch der Physik und Meteorologie'', Vol 2, Part 1 (1926) (Thresholds of Color Differences).\n\nHis work on the psychology of colour perception follows the step of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|von Helmholtz]] in the same area. Some of these paper have been translated to English and can be found in: ''Sources of Colour Science'', Ed. David L. MacAdam, MIT Press (1970).\n\n==Legacy==\nThe philosophical issues raised by [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] are still debated today and remain his most enduring legacy in popular science, while [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level. To this day, Schr\u00f6dinger is known as '''the [[father of quantum mechanics]]'''. The large crater [[Schr\u00f6dinger (crater)|Schr\u00f6dinger]], on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side of the Moon]], is named after him. The [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics]] was established in Vienna in 1993.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's portrait was the main feature of the design of the [[Austrian schilling#Banknotes|1983\u201397 Austrian 1000-Schilling banknote]], the second-highest denomination.\n\nA building is named after him at the [[University of Limerick]], in Limerick, Ireland,<ref>{{cite web |title=Buildings at A Glance |publisher=[[University of Limerick]] |url=http://www2.ul.ie/web/WWW/Services/Buildings_and_Estates/At_A_Glance |accessdate=17 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330072324/http://www2.ul.ie/web/WWW/Services/Buildings_and_Estates/At_A_Glance |archive-date=30 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> as is the 'Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Zentrum' at [[Adlershof]] in Berlin.<ref name=\"EYCNDA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanyoungchemists.eu/index.php?page=venue|title=EYCN Delegates Assembly|year=2015|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's 126th birthday anniversary was celebrated with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's Google doodle marks quantum mechanics work|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/12/erwin-schrodinger-google-doodle|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Rob|title=Google Doodle honours quantum physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger (and his theoretical cat)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-doodle-honours-quantum-physicist-erwin-schrdinger-and-his-theoretical-cat-8756744.html|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 August 2013|location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\n* [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] (1933) \u2013 for the formulation of the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n* [[Max Planck Medal]] (1937)\n* Elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1949|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1949]]<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n* [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Prize]] of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (1956)\n* [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]] (1957)\n\n[[Schrodinger's cat]] is named in his honour, see also [[list of things named after Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]].\n\n==Published works==\n* [http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/schrodinger/ebibliographie/publications.htm The List of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's publications], compiled by [[Auguste Dick]], Gabriele Kerber, Wolfgang Kerber and Karl von Meyenn\n* ''Science and the human temperament'' [[Allen & Unwin]] (1935), translated and introduced by [[James Vincent Murphy|James Murphy]], with a foreword by [[Ernest Rutherford]]\n* ''Nature and the Greeks'' and ''Science and Humanism'' Cambridge University Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-521-57550-8}}.\n* ''The interpretation of Quantum Mechanics'' Ox Bow Press (1995) {{ISBN|1-881987-09-4}}.\n* ''Statistical Thermodynamics'' Dover Publications (1989) {{ISBN|0-486-66101-6}}.\n* ''Collected papers'' Friedr.

He is principally remembered as the creator and host of the television variety program ''The Toast of the Town'', later popularly\u2014and, eventually, officially\u2014renamed ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

A phonograph was a prized possession; the family loved playing all types of records on it. Sullivan was a gifted athlete in high school, earning 12 athletic letters at Port Chester High School. He played halfback in football; he was a guard in basketball; in track he was a sprinter. With the baseball team, Sullivan was catcher and team captain, and he led the team to several championships. Baseball made an impression on him that would affect his career as well as the culture of America. Sullivan noted that, in the state of New York, regarding high school sports, then  integration was taken for granted: \"When we went up into Connecticut, we ran into clubs that had Negro players. In those days this was accepted as commonplace; and so, my instinctive antagonism years later to any theory that a Negro wasn't a worthy opponent or was an inferior person. It was just as simple as that.\"<ref>Nachman (2009)</ref>\n\nSullivan landed his first job at ''The Port Chester Daily Item'', a local newspaper for which he had written sports news while in high school and then joined the paper full-time after graduation. In 1919, he joined ''The Hartford Post''. The newspaper folded in his first week there, but he landed another job on ''The New York Evening Mail'' as a sports reporter. After ''The Evening Mail'' closed in 1923, he bounced through a series of news jobs with The Associated Press, ''The Philadelphia Bulletin'', ''The Morning World'', ''The Morning Telegraph'', ''The New York Bulletin'' and ''The Leader''. Finally, in 1927, Sullivan joined ''The Evening Graphic'' as first sports writer and then sports editor. In 1929, when  [[Walter Winchell]] moved to ''The Daily Mirror'', Sullivan was made Broadway columnist. His theatre column was later carried in the ''New York Daily News''. His column, \"Little Old New York\", concentrated on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] shows and gossip, as Winchell's had; and, like Winchell, he did show-business news broadcasts on radio. Again echoing Winchell, Sullivan took on yet another medium in 1933 by writing and starring in the film ''[[Mr. Broadway (1933 film)|Mr. Broadway]]'', which has him guiding the audience around New York nightspots to meet entertainers and celebrities. Sullivan soon became a powerful starmaker in the entertainment world himself, becoming one of Winchell's main rivals, setting the [[El Morocco]] nightclub in New York as his unofficial headquarters against Winchell's seat of power at the nearby [[Stork Club]]. Sullivan continued writing for ''The News'' throughout his broadcasting career, and his popularity long outlived Winchell's.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThroughout his career as a columnist, Sullivan had dabbled in entertainment\u2014producing vaudeville shows with which he appeared as master of ceremonies in the 1920s and 1930s, directing a radio program over the original WABC (now WCBS) and organizing benefit reviews for various causes.\n\n===Radio===\nIn 1941, Sullivan was host of the ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Summer Silver Theater]]'', a variety program on [[CBS]], with [[Will Bradley]] as bandleader and a guest star featured each week.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sunday|journal=Radio and Television Mirror|date=September 1941|volume=16|issue=5|page=41|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiotelevisi00macf#page/n250/mode/1up|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Television==\n[[File:Ed Sullivan Cole Porter Toast of the Town 1952.JPG|thumb|180px|Sullivan with [[Cole Porter]] on ''Toast of the Town'' in 1952]]\nIn 1948, [[Marlo Lewis]], a producer, got the CBS network to hire Sullivan to do a weekly Sunday-night TV variety show, ''Toast of the Town'', which later became ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Debuting in June 1948, the show was originally broadcast from the Maxine Elliott Theatre on West 39th Street in New York City. In January 1953, it moved to CBS-TV Studio 50, at 1697 Broadway (at 53rd Street) in New York City, which in 1967 was renamed the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] (and was later the home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'').  Studio 50 was formerly a CBS Radio studio, from 1936 to 1953, and before that was the legitimate Hammerstein Theatre, built in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/ed-sullivan-theater |title=Ed Sullivan Theater &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTelevision critics gave the new show and its host poor reviews.<ref name=\"time19551017\"/> [[Harriet Van Horne]] alleged that \"he got where he is not by having a personality, but by having ''no'' personality.\" (The host wrote to the critic, \"Dear Miss Van Horne: You bitch.

There was something for everyone.<ref name=\"time19551017\"/> A typical show would feature a [[vaudeville]] act (acrobats, jugglers, magicians, etc.), one or two popular comedians, a singing star, a hot jukebox favorite, a figure from the legitimate theater, and for the kids, a visit with puppet \"[[Topo Gigio]], the little Italian mouse\", or a popular athlete. The bill was often international in scope, with many European performers augmenting the American artists.<ref name=\"time19671013\"/>\n\nSullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014impersonators such as [[John Byner]], [[Frank Gorshin]], [[Rich Little]], and especially [[Will Jordan]] to imitate him on his show. [[Johnny Carson]] also did a fair impression, and even [[Joan Rivers]] imitated Sullivan's unique posture. The impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders, and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as \"And now, right here on our stage...\", \"For all you youngsters out there...\", and \"a really big shew\" (his pronunciation of the word \"show\"). Will Jordan portrayed Sullivan in the films ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'', ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'', ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'', ''[[Down with Love]]'', and in the 1979 TV movie ''[[Elvis (1979 film)|Elvis]]''.\n\nSullivan inspired a song in the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'',<ref name=pc7>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19754/ |title=Show 7 \u2013 The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the rock-a-billies.

He had a knack for identifying and promoting top talent and paid a great deal of money to secure that talent for his show. Sullivan was quoted by saying \"In the conduct of my own show, I've never asked a performer his religion, his race or his politics. Performers are engaged on the basis of their abilities. I believe that this is another quality of our show that has helped win it a wide and loyal audience.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Ed|title=My Story|journal=Colliers Magazine|date=1952|volume=1 of 3 part series|issue=September 14, 1952}}</ref>\"\n\nAlthough Sullivan was wary of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"bad boy\" image, and initially said that he would never book him, Presley became too big a name to ignore; in 1956, Sullivan signed him for three appearances.<ref name=pc7/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/1950s/qt/elvissullivan.htm |title=Elvis on the Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=History1900s.about.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref> In August 1956, Sullivan was injured in an automobile accident near his country home in [[Southbury, Connecticut]], and missed Presley's first appearance on September 9.

In November 1963, while in [[Heathrow Airport]], Sullivan witnessed [[Beatlemania]] as the band returned from Sweden. At first he was reluctant to book [[the Beatles]] because the band did not have a commercially successful single released in the US at the time, but at the behest of a friend, legendary impresario [[Sid Bernstein]], Sullivan signed the group.  Their initial Sullivan show appearance on February 9, 1964, was the most-watched program in TV history to that point, and remains one of the most-watched programs of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-beatles |title=The Beatles &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref> The Beatles appeared three more times in person, and submitted filmed performances later. [[The Dave Clark Five]], who claimed a \"cleaner\" image than the Beatles, made 13 appearances on the show, more than any other UK group.\n\nUnlike many shows of the time, Sullivan asked that most musical acts perform their music live, rather than lip-synching to their recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com |title=Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more |publisher=Amazon.com |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref> Examination of performances show that exceptions were made, as when a microphone could not be placed close enough to a performer for technical reasons. An example was [[B.J. Thomas]]' 1969 performance of \"[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]\", in which actual water was sprinkled on him as a special effect. In 1969, Sullivan presented [[the Jackson 5]] with their first single \"[[I Want You Back]]\", which ousted the B.J. Thomas song from the top spot of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard's'']] pop charts.\n\n[[File:Ed Sullivan as clown 1972.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Sullivan, in full clown regalia, hosting the 1972 special ''Clownaround'']]\n\nSullivan appreciated African American talent.

In 1961, Sullivan was asked by CBS to fill in for an ailing [[Red Skelton]] on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''. Sullivan took Skelton's roles in the various comedy sketches; Skelton's hobo character \"Freddie the Freeloader\" was renamed \"Eddie the Freeloader.\"\n\n==Personality==\nSullivan was quick to take offense if he felt that he had been crossed, and he could hold a grudge for a long time. As he told biographer Gerald Nachman, \"I'm a pop-off. I flare up, then I go around apologizing.\"<ref>Nachman (2009), Kindle location 5681.</ref>  \"Armed with an Irish temper and thin skin,\" wrote Nachman, \"Ed brought to his feuds a hunger for combat fed by his coverage of, and devotion to, boxing.\"<ref>Nachman (2009), Kindle location 5690.</ref> [[Bo Diddley]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Jackie Mason]], and [[Jim Morrison]] were parties to some of Sullivan's most storied conflicts.\n\nFor his second Sullivan appearance in 1955, Bo Diddley planned to sing his namesake hit, \"[[Bo Diddley (song)|Bo Diddley]]\", but Sullivan told him to perform [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s song \"[[Sixteen Tons]]\".  \"That would have been the end of my career right there,\" he told his biographer,<ref>White, G.R. (1998)''Bo Diddley: Living Legend''. Music Sales Corp. p. 133. {{ISBN|1860741304}}.</ref> so he sang \"Bo Diddley\" anyway.  Sullivan was enraged: \"You're the first black boy that ever double-crossed me on the show,\" Diddley quoted him as saying. \"We didn't have much to do with each other after that.\"<ref>White (1998), p. 134.</ref>  Later, Diddley resented that Elvis Presley, whom he accused of copying his revolutionary style and beat, received the attention and accolades on Sullivan's show that he felt were rightfully his.  \"I am owed,\" he said, \"and I never got paid.\"<ref>White (1998), p. 144.</ref>  \"He might have,\" wrote Nachman, \"had things gone smoother with Sullivan.\"<ref>Nachman (2009), p. 277.</ref>\n\n[[The Crickets|Buddy Holly and the Crickets]] first appeared on the Sullivan show in 1957 to an enthusiastic response. For their second appearance in January 1958, Sullivan considered the lyrics of their chosen number \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\" too suggestive, and ordered Holly to substitute another song. Holly responded that he had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \"Oh, Boy!\" for them. Sullivan, unaccustomed to having his instructions questioned, angrily repeated them, but Holly refused to back down.  Later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, Sullivan commented, \"I guess the Crickets are not too excited to be on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.\"  Holly, still annoyed by Sullivan's attitude, replied, \"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\"  Sullivan retaliated by cutting them from two numbers to one, then mispronounced Holly's name during the introduction.  He also saw to it that Holly's guitar amplifier was turned off.  Nevertheless, the band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back; Holly responded that Sullivan did not have enough money.  Archival photographs taken during the appearance show Holly smirking and ignoring a visibly angry Sullivan.<ref>Moore, Gary (2011).

Sullivan apparently had no idea who McCartney was. McCartney tried to remind Sullivan that he was one of the Beatles, but Sullivan obviously could not remember, and nodding and smiling, simply shook McCartney's hand and left. In an interview with [[Howard Stern]] around 2012, [[Joan Rivers]] said that Sullivan had been suffering from [[dementia]] toward the end of his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Politics==\n\nSullivan, like many American entertainers, was pulled into the [[Cold War]] [[anticommunism]] of the late 1940s and 1950s. Tap dancer [[Paul Draper (dancer)|Paul Draper]]'s scheduled January 1950 appearance on ''Toast of the Town'' met with opposition from Hester McCullough, an activist in the hunt for \"subversives\".  Branding Draper a [[Communist Party]] \"sympathizer\", she demanded that Sullivan\u2019s lead sponsor, the Ford Motor Company, cancel Draper\u2019s appearance.  Draper denied the charge, and appeared on the show as scheduled.  Ford received over a thousand angry letters and telegrams, and Sullivan was obliged to promise Ford\u2019s advertising agency, Kenyon & Eckhardt, that he would avoid controversial guests going forward.  Draper was forced to move to Europe to earn a living.<ref name=b1/>\n\nAfter the Draper incident, Sullivan began to work closely with Theodore Kirkpatrick of the anticommunist ''[[Red Channels|Counterattack]]'' newsletter. He would consult Kirkpatrick if  any questions came up regarding a potential guest's political leanings. Sullivan wrote in his June 21, 1950, ''Daily News'' column that \"Kirkpatrick has sat in my living room on several occasions and listened attentively to performers eager to secure a certification of loyalty.\"<ref name=b1>Barnouw, E.

His chosen song was \"[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]\", which poked fun at the ultraconservative [[John Birch Society]] and its tendency to see Communist conspiracies in many situations.  No concern was voiced by anyone, including Sullivan, during rehearsals, but on the day of the broadcast, CBS's Standards and Practices department rejected the song, fearing that lyrics equating the Society\u2019s views with those of [[Adolf Hitler]] might trigger a defamation lawsuit.  Dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice, he would rather not appear at all.  The story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed; Sullivan denounced the network\u2019s decision in published interviews.<ref>\"Bob Dylan walks out on The Ed Sullivan Show\".

In 1956, [[Ingrid Bergman]]\u2014who had been living in \"exile\" in Europe since 1950 in the wake of her scandalous love affair with director [[Roberto Rossellini]] while they were both married\u2014was planning a return to Hollywood as the star of ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]''.  Sullivan, confident that the American public would welcome her back, invited her to appear on his show and flew to Europe to film an interview with Bergman, [[Yul Brynner]], and [[Helen Hayes]] on the ''Anastasia'' set.  When he arrived back in New York, Standards and Practices informed Sullivan that under no circumstances would Bergman be permitted to appear on the show, either live or on film.  Sullivan's prediction later proved correct, as Bergman won her second [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her portrayal, as well as the forgiveness of her fans.<ref name=Million>{{cite book|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|title=Fifty Million People Can't Be Wrong|author=Merwin, Gregory|date=May 1957|publisher=TV-Radio Mirror|pages=32\u201333|accessdate=February 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002135647/http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|archivedate=October 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}([[PDF]])</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ed Sullivan with wife 1956.jpg|thumb|Sullivan with wife in a hospital after his 1956 car accident]]\nSullivan was engaged to champion swimmer [[Sybil Bauer]], but she died of cancer in 1927 at the age of 23.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sisson |first1=Richard |last2=Zacher |first2=Christian K. |last3=Cayton |first3=Andrew R.

Weinstein tried to tell her Jewish family she was dating a man named Ed Solomon, but her brother figured out she meant Ed Sullivan. With both families strongly opposed to a Catholic\u2013Jewish marriage, the affair was on-again-off-again for three years.  They were finally married on April 28, 1930, in a City Hall ceremony, and a year later Sylvia gave birth to Elizabeth (\"Betty\"), named after Sullivan\u2019s mother, who had died that year.\n\nThe Sullivans were always \"on the town\", eating out five nights a week at some of the trendiest clubs and restaurants including the [[Stork Club]], Danny\u2019s Hideaway and Jimmy Kelly\u2019s.

Most of the taped programs, as well as some early [[kinescopes]], were preserved, and excerpts have been released on [[home video]].\n\nBy 1971, the show's ratings had plummeted. In an effort to refresh its lineup, CBS canceled the program along with some of its other longtime shows (later known as the [[rural purge]]). Sullivan was angered and refused to do a final show, although he remained with the network in various other capacities and hosted a 25th anniversary special in June 1973.\n\nIn early September 1974, [[X-ray]]s revealed that Sullivan had an advanced growth of [[esophageal cancer]].  Doctors gave him very little time to live, and the family chose to keep the diagnosis secret from him.

In every line it betrays its origin as a genuine letter of Paul.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Epistle of Paul to the Galatians|last=Duncan|first=George S.|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1934|isbn=|location=London|pages=xviii}}</ref>  Moreover, Paul's possible description of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ({{bibleref2|Galatians|2:1\u201310|9|Gal.2:1\u201310}}) gives a different point of view from the description in {{bibleref2|Acts|15:2\u201329|9|Acts 15:2\u201329}}, if it is, in fact, describing the Jerusalem Council.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = A Critical Introduction to the New Testament|last = Holladay|first = Carl R.|publisher = Abingdon Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Nashville, TN|pages = 463\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe central dispute in the letter concerns the question of how Gentiles could convert to Christianity, which shows that this letter was written at a very early stage in church history, when the vast majority of Christians were Jewish or Jewish [[proselytes]], which historians refer to as the [[Jewish Christians]]. Another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the Christian community at large. This puts it during the lifetime of Paul himself.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNevertheless, a small number of scholars have questioned Paul's authorship of Galatians, such as [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Abraham Dirk Loman|Abraham Loman,]] [[Christian Hermann Weisse|C. H. Weisse]] and Frank R. McGuire.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Galatians|last=Longenecker|first=Richard|publisher=Zondervan|year=1990|isbn=|location=|page=lviii|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Galatia===\nPaul's letter is addressed \"to the churches of Galatia\" ({{bibleref|Galatians|1:2|9}}), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. A minority of scholars have argued that the \"Galatia\" is an ethnic reference to a [[Celt]]ic people living in northern [[Asia Minor]], but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul's day. [[Acts of the Apostles]] records Paul traveling to the \"region of Galatia and [[Phrygia]]\", which lies immediately west of Galatia.<ref>Acts [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:6;&version=31; 16:6] and Acts [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018:23;&version=31; 18:23]</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=October 2013}} claim the New Testament says that the churches of Galatia ([[Antioch of Pisidia]], [[Iconium]], [[Lystra]] and [[Derbe]]) were founded by Paul himself ({{bibleref|Acts|16:6|9}}; {{bibleref2|Galatians.1:8;4:13;4:19||9}}). They seem to have been composed mainly of converts from [[paganism]] ({{bibleref|Galatians|4:8|9}}). After Paul's departure, the churches were led astray from Paul's trust/faith-centered teachings by individuals proposing \"another gospel\" (which centered on salvation through the [[Mosaic law]], so-called [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]]), whom Paul saw as preaching a \"different gospel\" from what Paul had taught ({{bibleref2|Galatians|1:6\u20139|9|Galatians 1:1\u20139}}). The Galatians appear to have been receptive to the teaching of these newcomers, and the epistle is Paul's response to what he sees as their willingness to turn from his teaching.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe identity of these \"opponents\" is disputed. However, the majority of modern scholars view them as Jewish Christians, who taught that in order for converts to belong to the [[People of God]], they must be subject to some or all of the Jewish Law, (i.e. [[Judaizer]]s). The letter indicates controversy concerning [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath observance]], and the [[Biblical law in Christianity|Mosaic Covenant]]. It would appear, from Paul's response, that they cited the example of [[Abraham]], who was [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]] as a mark of receiving the [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|covenant blessings]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|17|9}}). They certainly appear to have questioned Paul's authority as an [[Twelve apostles|apostle]], perhaps appealing to the greater authority of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] governed by [[James (brother of Jesus)]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====North Galatian view====\nThe North Galatian view holds that the epistle was written very soon after Paul's second visit to Galatia ({{bibleref|Acts|18:23|9}}). In this view, the visit to [[Jerusalem]], mentioned in {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:1\u201310|9|Galatians 2:1\u201310}}, is identical with that of Acts 15, which is spoken of as a thing of the past. Consequently, the epistle seems to have been written after the [[Council of Jerusalem]]. The similarity between this epistle and the epistle to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at roughly the same time, during Paul's stay in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] in roughly 56\u201357.<ref>Craig Evans, The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary (Colorado Springs, CO: Victor 2004), 2: 462, {{bibleref2|Acts|20:2\u20133|9|Acts 20:2\u20133}}</ref>\n\nThis third date takes the word \"quickly\" in Gal. 1:6 literally.<ref>Craig Evans, The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary (Colorado Springs, CO: Victor 2004), 2: 462.</ref> [[John P.

Antioch & Rome: New Testament Cradles of Catholic Christianity (Paulist Press: New York, 1983) 113.</ref> Eminent Biblical scholar [[Helmut Koester]] also subscribes to the \"North Galatian Hypothesis\". Koester points out that the cities of Galatia in the north consist of Ankyra, Pessinus, and Gordium (of the [[Gordian Knot]] fame of [[Alexander the Great]]).<ref>Koester, Helmut, Introduction to the New Testament, Volume 2 (Walter de Gruyter & Co.: Berlin, 2000) 114. (</ref>\n\n====South Galatian view====\nThe South Galatian view holds that Paul wrote Galatians before or shortly after the First Jerusalem Council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian,<ref>Acts [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:30;&version=31; 9:30]</ref> or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.<ref>Craig Evans, ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'' (Colorado Springs, CO: Victor 2004), 2: 462.</ref>\n\n====Earliest epistle====\nA third theory<ref>[[Ronald Y. K. Fung]], ''The Epistle to the Galatians'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdman's Press, 1988), 16\u201322. See also [http://www.theologywebsite.com/nt/galatians.shtml New Testament Study Helps: Galatians] Theology WebSite</ref> is that Galatians 2:1\u201310 describes Paul and Barnabas' visit to Jerusalem described in Acts 11:30 and 12:25. This theory holds that the epistle was written before the Council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of Paul's epistles. According to this theory, the revelation mentioned (Gal 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of Agabus (Acts 11:27\u201328). This view holds that the private speaking about the gospel shared among the Gentiles precludes the Acts 15 visit, but fits perfectly with Acts 11. It further holds that continuing to remember the poor (Gal. 2: 10) fits with the purpose of the Acts 11 visit, but not Acts 15.<ref>Ronald Y.K. Fung, ''The Epistle to the Galatians'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdman's Press, 1988), 19.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the exclusion of any mention of the letter of Acts 15 is seen to indicate that such a letter did not yet exist, since Paul would have been likely to use it against the legalism confronted in Galatians. Finally, this view doubts Paul's confrontation of Peter (Gal. 2:11) would have been necessary after the events described in Acts 15. If this view is correct, the epistle should be dated somewhere around 47, depending on other difficult to date events, such as Paul's conversion.<ref>Ronald Y.K. Fung, ''The Epistle to the Galatians'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdman's Press, 1988), 19.</ref>\n\n[[Kirsopp Lake]] found this view less likely and wondered why it would be necessary for the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) to take place at all if the issue were settled in Acts 11:30/12:25, as this view holds.<ref>Kirsopp Lake, ''The Beginnings of Christianity'', vol 5. ed F. J. Foakes-Jackson and K. Lake (London: 1920\u201333), 201.</ref> Defenders of the view do not think it unlikely an issue of such magnitude would need to be discussed more than once.<ref>I.H. Marshall, ''The Acts of the Apostles'' ([[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]; Grand Rapids, 1980), 205.</ref> Renowned New Testament scholar [[Joseph Lightfoot|J.B. Lightfoot]] also objected to this view since it \"clearly implies that his [Paul's] Apostolic office and labours were well known and recognized before this conference.\"<ref name=\"Fung\">Ronald Y. K. Fung, ''The Epistle to the Galatians'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdman's Press, 1988), 19</ref>\n\nDefenders of this view, such as Ronald Fung, disagree with both parts of Lightfoot's statement, insisting a) Paul received his \"Apostolic Office\" at his conversion (Gal. 1:15\u201317; Ac. 9). Fung holds, then, that Paul's apostolic mission began almost immediately in Damascus (Acts 9:20). While accepting that Paul's apostolic anointing was likely only recognized by the Apostles in Jerusalem during the events described in Gal. 2/Acts 11:30, Fung does not see this as a problem for this theory.<ref name=\"Fung\" />\n\n==Outline==\n[[Image:PaulT.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Valentin de Boulogne]]'s depiction of \"Saint Paul Writing His Epistles\", 16th century (Blaffer Foundation Collection, [[Houston]], [[Texas]]).

Paul engages in an exegetical argument, drawing upon the figure of [[Abraham]] and the priority of his faith to the covenant of circumcision. Paul explains that the law was introduced as a temporary measure, one that is no longer efficacious now that the seed of Abraham, Christ, has come. Chapter 4 then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction, followed by {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:1\u20136:10|9|5:1\u20136:10}} teaching about the right use of their Christian freedom.\n\nIn the conclusion of the epistle, Paul wrote, \"See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.\" (Galatians 6:11, [[English Standard Version|ESV]]) Regarding this conclusion, [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|Lightfoot]], in his Commentary on the epistle, says:\n\n<blockquote>\"At this point the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand.

Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nThe historical background of Philippians is traditionally gathered from two main primary New Testament sources: informative internal data from the letter itself, and related information garnered from the rest of the [[New Testament Canon]], especially from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the other [[Pauline Epistles]].<ref>Frederick F. Bruce, 1989, ''Philippians'', NIBC, NT Series, edited by W. Ward Gasque (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson), 4.</ref> Other primary information is also derived from external historical sources related to the chronological connections between Paul's association with Philippi, its political and economic setting, and its social and religio-philosophical context.<ref>Wayne Jackson, 1987, ''The Book of Philippians: A Grammatical and Practical Study'' (Abilene, Tex.: Quality Publications), 13\u201317.</ref>\n\nAccording to the document itself, the Philippians had sent [[Epaphroditus]], their envoy (\"messenger [''apostolon''] and minister [''leitourgon'']\" Phil 2:25), with contributions as an expression of their \"partnership\" and \"concern\" to meet the needs of Paul ({{bibleverse||Phil|1:3\u20135|KJV|}}, {{bibleverse||Phil|2:30|KJV|}}, and {{bibleverse||Phil|4:10\u201319|KJV|}}).\n\nDuring the execution of his responsibilities of travel to deliver their \"gift\" ({{bibleverse||Phil|4:17|KJV|}}), Epaphroditus contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness (''esthenese'', cf. {{bibleverse||Phil|2:26\u201327|KJV|}}). At some point he recovers. It is at this time, whether premeditated or due to an extended stay with the apostle, various internal matters are revealed to Paul on the part of Epaphroditus ({{bibleverse||Phil|1:27\u201330|KJV|}}, {{bibleverse||Phil|2:19\u201324|KJV|}}, {{bibleverse||Phil|3:2\u20133|KJV|}}, {{bibleverse||Phil|3:17\u201320|KJV|}}, {{bibleverse||Phil|4:2\u20133|KJV|}}, and {{bibleverse||Phil|4:9|KJV|}}).\n\nUpon Epaphroditus' return to health, Paul sends word to the Philippians through Epaphroditus of his upcoming sentence in Rome and of his optimism in the face of death (1:18b\u201326), along with exhortations to imitate his capacity to rejoice in the Lord despite one's circumstances (2:14\u201318). Moreover, Paul sends counsel regarding spiritual adversaries among the Philippians (3:1\u201321), and conflicts within their fellowship (4:2\u20133). Lastly, he provides receipt of both Epaphroditus' heroism (2:25\u201330) and the arrival of \"the gift\" (4:10), along with his promise of a divine accounting (4:17\u201320).\n\nWithin the letter is also found an optimism where Paul's belief of his release is the basis upon which he promises to send Timothy to them for ministry (3:19\u201323), and an anticipation to also pay them a personal visit (2:24). With this communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey (2:28\u201329).\n\nThere has been ongoing debate regarding where Paul was when he wrote this letter (and therefore the date of the letter's composition). Internal evidence in the letter itself points clearly to it being composed while Paul was in custody (Philippians 1:7,13), but which period of imprisonment is highly debated {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Some suggest the Roman imprisonment at the end of the Book of Acts (chapter 28:30,31). Others suggest the earlier [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarean]] imprisonment (Acts 23\u201326). Still others suggest an earlier imprisonment again, and postulate an [[Ephesus|Ephesian]] imprisonment during Paul's lengthy stay in that city (Acts 19). Until recently no one seems to have advocated the second period of Roman imprisonment (after the end of the book of Acts, but attested to in the writings of [[Early Church Fathers|early church fathers]]).<ref>[[Clement of Rome]] (late 1st century) makes a reference to the ministry of Paul after the end of Acts. Clement, To the Corinthians, 5. In J. B. Lightfoot (ed), The Apostolic Fathers (Michigan: Baker Book House, 1978) 15. The author of the [[Muratorian Canon]] (late 2nd century) says that Luke recorded mostly that which he himself witnessed and therefore that is why he did not include \u2018the journey of Paul, when he went from the city \u2013 Rome \u2013 to [[Spain]].\u2019 The Muratoriun Canon. 2.

Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.\nFor this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe letter was written to the church at [[Philippi]], one of the earliest churches to be founded in [[Europe]]. They were very attached to Paul, just as he was very fond of them. Of all the churches, their contributions (which Paul gratefully acknowledges) are among the only ones he accepts. ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts 20:33\u201335]]; [[2 Corinthians|2 Cor. 11:7\u201312]]; [[2 Thessalonians|2 Thess. 3:8]]). The generosity of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously (Phil. 4:15). \"This was a characteristic of the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] missions, as 2 Cor. 8 and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor (2 Cor. 8:2), though the very first converts were of all classes (Acts 16); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious.\" (Moule).\n\nAs with all epistles, the original was composed in Greek.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/alexander_a/canon.iv.x.html?highlight=epistle,greek,language,philippians#highlight Section X.

Who Wrote the New Testament?

(Marcionite canon; Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. 3.14.1; Muratorian canon). This traditional view stood [usually] unquestioned until 1838, when E. T. Mayerhoff denied the authenticity of this letter, claiming that it was full of non-Pauline ideas and dependent on the letter of [[Ephesians]]. Thereafter others have found additional arguments against Pauline authorship.\" New Jerome Biblical Commentary</ref> Pauline authorship was held to by many of the early church's prominent theologians, such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], [[Origen of Alexandria]]  and [[Eusebius]].<ref>For a defense of Pauline authorship for Colossians see: Authenticity of [http://www.bible-apologetics.com/history/colossians.htm Colossians]</ref>\n\nHowever, as with several epistles attributed to Paul, critical scholarship disputes this claim.<ref>\"The cumulative weight of the many differences from the undisputed Pauline epistles has persuaded most modern [also some XVI century] scholars that Paul did not write Colossians ... Those who defend the authenticity of the letter include Martin, Caird, Houlden, Cannon and Moule. Some... describe the letter as Pauline but say that it was heavily interpolated or edited. Schweizer suggests that Col was jointly written by Paul and Timothy. The position taken here is that Col is Deutero-Pauline; it was composed after Paul\u2019s lifetime, between AD 70 (Gnilka) and AD 80 (Lohse) by someone who knew the Pauline tradition. Lohse regards Col as the product of a Pauline school tradition, probably located in Ephesus.\" [TNJBC 1990 p. 877]</ref> One ground is that the epistle's language doesn't seem to match Paul's, with 48 words appearing in Colossians that are found nowhere else in his writings and 33 of which occur nowhere else in the [[New Testament]].<ref name=\"Koester, Intro\">Koester, Helmut. History and Literature of Early Christianity, Introduction to the New Testament Vol 2. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter & Co, 1982, 1987.</ref> A second ground is that the epistle features a strong use of liturgical-hymnic style which appears nowhere else in Paul's work to the same extent.<ref name=\"Kummel, Intro\">Kummel, Georg Werner. Introduction To The New Testament, Revised English Edition, Translated by Howard Kee. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1973, 1975</ref> A third is that the epistle's themes related to Christ, eschatology and the church seem to have no parallel in Paul's undisputed works.<ref>\u201cThe christology of Col is built on the traditional hymn in 1:15\u201320, according to which Christ is the image of the invisible God... and other christological statements that have no parallel in the undisputed Pauline writings are added: that Christ is the mystery of God... that believers have been raised with Christ ... that Christ forgives sins... that Christ is victorious over the principalities and powers...\" Compared to undisputed Pauline epistles, in which Paul looks forward to an imminent Second Coming, Colossians presents a completed eschatology, in which baptism relates to the past (a completed salvation) rather than to the future: \u201c...whereas Paul expected the parousia in the near future (I Thes 4:15; 5:23; I Cor 7:26)... The congregation has already been raised from the dead with Christ ... whereas in the undisputed letters resurrection is a future expectation... The difference in eschatological orientation between Col and the undisputed letters results in a different theology of baptism... Whereas in Rom 6:1\u20134 baptism looks forward to the future, in Col baptism looks back to a completed salvation. In baptism believers have not only died with Christ but also been raised with him.\u201d The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, Edited by Raymond E.

It is argued that these differences can come by human variability, such as by growth in theological knowledge over time, different occasion for writing, as well as use of different secretaries (or [[amanuensis|amanuenses]]) in composition.<ref>Richard R.

In regard to the style, as Norman Perrin, who argues for pseudonymity, notes, \"The letter does employ a great deal of traditional material and it can be argued that this accounts for the non-Pauline language and style.

In Colossians there is mention of local brethren in Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis. Colossae was approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} from Laodicea and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from Hierapolis. Members of the congregation at Colossae had incorporated pagan elements into their practice, including worship of elemental spirits. The Epistle to the Colossians declares Christ's supremacy over the entire created universe and exhorts Christians to lead godly lives. The letter consists of two parts: first a doctrinal section, then a second regarding conduct. In both sections, false teachers who have been spreading error in the congregation are opposed.<ref name =\"Harris Colossians\"/>\n\n===Outline===\nI. Introduction (1:1\u201314)\n* A.

London: Hodder & Stoughton Ltd</ref>\n\n===Doctrinal sections===\nIn its doctrinal sections, Colossians emphatically explains that Christ is begotten before all creation (not created) and is supreme over all that has been created. All things were created through him and for him, and the universe is sustained by him. God had chosen for his complete being to dwell in Christ. The \"cosmic powers\" revered by the false teachers had been \"discarded\" and \"led captive\" at Christ's death. Christ is the master of all angelic forces and the head of the church. Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity, the unique agent of cosmic reconciliation. It is the Father in Colossians who is said to have delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,<ref>{{bibleverse ||Colossians|1:12\u201313|31}}.</ref> not the typical way of articulating salvation today. The Son is the agent of reconciliation and salvation not merely of the church, but in some sense redeems the rest of creation as well (\"all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven\").<ref>{{bibleverse ||Colossians|1:20|31}}</ref>\n\nThe doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters. Its main [[theme (literary)|theme]] is developed in Colossians chapter 2, with a warning against being drawn away from Him in whom dwelt all the fullness of the deity,<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb |Colossians|2:9}}</ref> and who was the head of all spiritual powers. Christ was the head of the body of which they were members; and if they were truly united to him, what more did they need?\n\nColossians praises the spiritual growth of the recipients because of their love for all the set-apart ones in Christ.<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb |Colossians|1:4}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb|Colossians|1:8}}</ref> It calls them to grow in wisdom and knowledge that their love might be principled love and not sentimentality.<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb |Colossians|1:9\u201311}}</ref> \"Christ in you is your hope of glory!\".<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb |Colossians|1:27}}</ref><ref name = \"Harris Colossians\" />\n\n'''\"Christ in you, the hope of Glory\"'''\n\nOne of the great themes of the doctrinal section of Colossians is promise of union with Christ through the indwelling life of God the Holy Spirit. For example, Colossians 1:27, \"To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= The Holy Bible : New International Version, containing the Old Testament and the New Testament |year=1984 |publisher= Zondervan |location= Grand Rapids, MI |isbn= 0-31090271-1}}</ref> The Apostle Paul wrote to remind them of this promise and guard them against moving their on going trust from Christ to other philosophies and traditions which did not depend on Christ.{{Citation needed |date= October 2016}}\n\n=== Conduct ===\nAs does 1 Corinthians 13, Colossians 1, in early verses, deals with faith, hope and love. While in the case of 1 Corinthians, the love \"does not\" statements, such as boasting, recall the criticisms of the Corinthians earlier in the book. Colossians is different. Paul looks at the faith, hope and love of the Colossian believers as evidence and validation of their faith experience. In introductory verses, 1:6\u20137, Paul states that the fruit seen in them started the day they understood the grace of God in truth. Conduct is a fruit of faith.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nColossians denounces [[ascetic]] practices or avoiding certain foods because Christ's death put an end to such distinctions. Believers are one in Christ, not divided between circumcised and uncircumcised, slave and free, and so on. He then calls on his audience to fulfill all domestic and social obligations. A striking image of religion by such rules used by Paul is his use of the word \"shadows\". Some practices in the past may be shadows of what is to come, but Christ is the one who cast the shadow.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nColossians does not state with precision what heresies were being faced by the church. There are approximately 44 different theories what the heresies encountered by the church at Colossae were, including a view there was no particular heresy at all but issues typical of those faced by believers. Some argue that it is not merely fasting or feasting or particular area of emotions, conduct or intellect that are denounced but doing them with an independent spirit, not connected to Christ, the head of the body or lack of appreciation of the gospel of grace.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe practical part of the Epistle,<ref>{{Bibleref2-nb|Colossians|3\u20134}}</ref> enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They are exhorted to mind things that are above Colossians 3:1\u20134, to mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man.<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb|Colossians|3:5\u201314}}</ref> Many special duties of the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian character. The letter ends with customary prayer, instruction, and greetings.<ref name =\"Harris Colossians\">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. \"Colossians\" pp. 337\u201338</ref>\n\n=== The Prison Epistles ===\nColossians is often categorized as one of the \"prison epistles\" that include [[Ephesians]], Colossians, [[Philippians]], and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]]. Colossians has some close parallels with the letter to Philemon\u2014names of some of the same people (e.g., [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], [[Aristarchus of Thessalonica|Aristarchus]], [[Archippus]], [[Saint Mark|Mark]], [[Epaphras]], [[Saint Luke|Luke]], [[Onesimus]], and [[Demas]]) appear in both epistles, and both were written by Paul.<ref name=\"colossians\">[Survey of the New Testament: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon]</ref>\n\n[[Tychicus]] is named as the bearer of the letter, just as he is in [[Ephesians]] and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]], and he is to tell the recipients of the state of the apostle.<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb|Colossians|4:7\u20139}}</ref> After friendly greetings,<ref>{{Bibleref2c-nb|Colossians|4:10\u201314}}</ref> he bids them exchange this letter with the one he had sent to the neighbouring [[Laodicean Church]]. (The [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] was a possible lost letter of Paul which some scholars identify with the canonical Epistle to the Ephesians, others dispute this view.) He then closes the letter with the usual salutation.\n\nColossians calls, in several places, for faithfulness to be recognized:\n* \"to the faithful brethren\"<ref>{{Bibleref2-nb|Colossians|1:2}}.</ref>\n* \"Epaphras...our dear fellowservant...faithful minister\"<ref>{{Bibleref2-nb|Colossians|1:7}}.</ref> \n* \"Tychicus...faithful minister and fellowservant\"<ref>{{Bibleref2-nb|Colossians|4:7}}.</ref> \n* \"Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother\"<ref>{{Bibleref2-nb|Colossians|4:9}}.</ref> \n\nIt is striking that the apostle writes in Col 1:28 [ESV]: \"Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. For this I [Paul] toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.\" Then in Col 3:16, Paul's goal is that the Colossians themselves to in some manner continue in this ministry and admonish and test each other, \"one another\" as Paul did for them. Col 3:16: \"Let the word of Christ dwell in you [Colossian believers] richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.\" In some sense, Paul would have the teaching and admonishing ministry continue by members of the church in Colossae.\n\nColossians has some interesting interpersonal dynamics. Epaphras, who first shared the good news to Colossae, near the opening of the book is presented as a beloved fellow servant\u2014\"one of us\" from Paul's ministry point of view. In contrast, towards the closing of the book he is called \"one of you\". Onesimus is also referred to as \"one of you\" and an important helper of Paul who was the run away slave in the book of Philemon who became a believer. His past is not brought up. Mark and Barnabus parted company with Paul over Mark leaving the mission after violent opposition in the book of Acts, but here is reconciled to Paul and spoken of as a comfort. Epharoditus, Paul refers to as a fellow prisoner, we recognize as the person in the book of Acts who was literally dragged through the streets into court on charges. Paul acknowledges that most never saw his face in Colossae or Laodicea, yet was concerned throughout the book they were aware of the events going on with himself, and appointed Tychicus to inform them so that they should understand how great Paul's suffering for them has been.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Epistle to the Colossians|Textual variants in the Epistle to the Colossians]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography==\n* R.

For the most part, the letter is personal in nature, with only the final two chapters spent addressing issues of doctrine, almost as an aside. Paul's main purpose in writing is to encourage and reassure the [[Christianity|Christians]] there. Paul urges them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]].\n\n===Date===\nUnlike all subsequent Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on [[justification by faith]] or questions of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Jewish\u2013Gentile relations]], themes that are covered in all other letters.

According to [[Eusebius]] of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] in the [[Church History (Eusebius)|''Ecclesiastical History'']], he served as the first bishop of [[Crete]] and remained there in his old years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was buried in Cortyna ([[Gortyn|Gortyna]]), Crete; his head was later removed to Venice during the invasion of Crete by the [[Saracens]] in 832 and was enshrined in [[St Mark's Basilica]], Venice, Italy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Composition==\n{{further information|First Epistle to Timothy#Authorship}}\n\nScholars are not unanimous about the authenticity of the pastoral epistles,<ref name=\"Harris\"/>{{page needed|date=February  2017}} but it is considered pseudepigraphic by about 80% of scholars.<ref name=\"Fjust\">{{cite web|last1=S.J.|first1=Felix Just,|title=Deutero-Pauline Letters|url=http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Paul-Disputed.htm|website=catholic-resources.org}}</ref> Titus is usually one of the three [[Pastoral epistles]] attributed to Paul.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 385ff</ref>\n\n===Pauline authenticity===\nThe author of ''Titus'' identifies himself as \"Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ.\" According to ''[[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]'' (1893), The Epistle was probably written about the same time as the [[First Epistle to Timothy]], with which it has many affinities.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Titus, Epistle to|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.org/3684-Titus_Epistle_to.php|website=eastonsbibledictionary.org}}</ref>\n\nScholars who believe Paul wrote ''Titus'' date its composition from the circumstance that it was written after Paul's visit to [[Crete]] (Titus 1:5). That visit could not be the one referred to in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 27:7, when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years. Thus traditional [[exegesis]] supposes that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into Asia, passing Crete by the way, and that there he left [[Titus]] \"to set in order the things that were wanting.\" Thence he would have gone to [[Ephesus]], where he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], where he wrote the ''First Epistle to Timothy'', and thence, according to the subscription of this epistle, to \"Nicopolis of Macedonia\",<ref>\"It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.\" \u2014[[Authorized Version]] subscription after Titus 3:15\n* Note: Sources that say [[Nicopolis]] was in [[Epirus]] are technically correct, but Epirus had become part of [[Macedonia (Roman province)]] in 146 BCE. In 110 CE under Trajan it became a province in its own right, separate from Macedonia and Achaia. The expression \"Nicopolis of Macedonia\" in Paul's timeframe is valid.</ref> from which place he wrote to Titus, about 66 or 67.\n\n[[File:Minuscule 699 GA folio 41v.jpg|thumb|220px|The first page of the epistle in [[Minuscule 699]] gives its title as '''\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd'', \"To Titus.\"]]\n\nRecent scholarship has revived the theory that Paul used an [[amanuensis]], or secretaries, in writing his letters (e.g. Rom 16:22), but possibly Luke for the pastorals<ref>George W.

Critics claim the vocabulary and style of the Pauline letters could not have been written by Paul according to available biographical information and reflect the views of the emerging Church rather than the apostle's.

In addition to rehearsals in their home countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the Eurovision auditorium. These rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the Saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. Journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of Eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |date=17 March 2008 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |title=Belgrade 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518160711/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=587 |archivedate=18 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nEach participating broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose job it is to co-ordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city.<ref name=\"2005rules\">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |year=2005 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |title=Rules of the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest |accessdate=10 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210010517/http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |archivedate=10 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and\u2014in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra\u2014a conductor.

There are two rehearsal periods for each country. The countries taking part in the semi-finals have their first rehearsal over four days from the first Sunday to Wednesday. The second is from Thursday to Sunday.

Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions.<ref name=\"RehearsalSchedule\">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|year=2008|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/media/ESC2008_rehearsals.pdf|title=Rehearsal Schedule|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing.

Two rehearsals are held the day before (one in the afternoon and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event.

This is usually held in a grand municipally owned location in the city centre.

However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.<ref name=\"Euroclub\"/>\n\n== Rules ==\n{{further information|Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n\nNumerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.\n\n=== Live music ===\n\nAll vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks.<ref name=\"2009rules\"/> In 1999, [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|the Croatian song]] performed by [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]] and composed by [[Ton\u010di Hulji\u0107]] featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.<ref name=\"ESC1999\">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted\u2014although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> The host that year, Israel's [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main article|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n\nEach submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966 a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer [[Ingvar Wixell]] performing [[Absent Friend|Sweden's 1965 entry]] in English.<ref name=\"milestones\"/> The Swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at [[Melodifestivalen 1965]], but it was later translated into English for the Eurovision contest.\n\nThe language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.<ref name=\"ESC1973\">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974.\n\nIn 1977, the EBU decided to revert to the national language restriction. However, special dispensation was given to Germany and Belgium as their national selections had already taken place before the decision was made; both countries' entries that year were in English.<ref name=\"ESC1977\">{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=293|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1977|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the rule was changed again to allow the choice of language once more, which resulted in 12 out of 23 countries, including the United Kingdom, [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|singing in English that year]].<ref name=\"ESC1999\"/> Belgium entered the 2003 contest with \"[[Sanomi]]\", a song sung in a [[constructed language]],<ref name=\"ArtificialLanguages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade!|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|first=Andreas |last=Schacht|date=9 March 2008|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> finishing in second place. In 2006 the Dutch entry, \"[[Amambanda]]\", was sung partly in English and partly in an artificial language.<ref name=\"ArtificialLanguages\"/> In 2008 the Belgian entry, \"[[O Julissi]]\", was sung in an artificial language.<ref name=\"ArtificialLanguages\"/> In 2011 the Norwegian entry, \"[[Haba Haba]]\", which was sung in English and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], was the first song to be sung in an African language, apart from Arabic.<ref name=\"AfricanLanguage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16749|title=Norway sends Stella Mwangi to Eurovision 2011|publisher=''EscToday.com''|first=Victor|last=Hondal|date=12 February 2011|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nSince the language rule was abolished in 1999, songs in English have become increasingly more common. In 2016 all but three out of 36 semi-finalists had songs in English, with only two (Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia) performing songs in their native languages, as Austria sent a song in French. In the final, all but three out of 26 contestants had songs in English. After [[Salvador Sobral]]'s win in 2017 with a Portuguese-language song, the 2018 edition saw a significant increase in the use of native languages, with twelve of 43 participants singing in their country's native language (not including Estonia, whose representative opted to sing in Italian).{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Voting ===\n{{further information|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n\nThe voting system used in the contest has changed over the years. The current system has been in place since 2016, and is a [[positional voting system]]. Each country awards two sets of 12, 10, 8\u20131 points to their 10 favourite songs: one from their professional jury of votes of five music professionals and the other from televoting.<ref name=\"2016 voting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=biggest_change_to_eurovision_song_contest_voting_since_1975|title=Biggest change to Eurovision Song Contest voting since 1975|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, a country's votes were decided by an internal jury, but in 1997 five countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) experimented with [[televoting]], giving members of the public in those countries the opportunity to vote ''en masse'' for their favourite songs.

Back-up juries are still used by each country, in the event of a televoting failure. Nowadays members of the public may also vote by SMS, in addition to televoting. In every case, every country cannot vote for its own song <ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200705/11/eng20070511_373758.html |title=People's Daily Online \u2013 Eurovision Song Contest semi-final held in Helsinki |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> From 2013, the public may also vote via a [[mobile app]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_song_contest_app_launched|title=Eurovision Song Contest app launched!|publisher=Eurovision.tv |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/static/app/|title=Download the official Eurovision app|publisher=Eurovision.tv |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe current method for ranking entries, introduced in 2016, is to sum together the points calculated from the [[televoting|telephone vote]] and the jury separately.<ref name=\"2016 voting\"/> Prior to this, the jury and televoting rankings were combined 50/50 before the number of points were calculated.<ref name=\"2010 voting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=11 October 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> It was first used in the final of the&nbsp;[[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 edition]], and extended the following year to the semi-finals.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1883&voter=MD |title=Full Splitt Results |date=May 2014 |work=European Broadcasting Union |publisher=eurovision.tv |accessdate=28 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126111421/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1883&voter=MD |archivedate=26 November 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1893&voter=GE |title=Full Splitt Results |date=May 2014 |work=European Broadcasting Union |publisher=eurovision.tv |accessdate=28 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111173206/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1893&voter=GE |archivedate=11 November 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSince 1964 the voting has been presided over by the EBU [[scrutineer]], who is responsible for ensuring that all points are allocated correctly and in turn.

Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]] or an Italian presenter might be seen with the [[Colosseum]] in the background.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO codes]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]'' |date=12 May 2004 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |title=Eurovision 2004 \u2013 Voting Briefing |accessdate=7 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507155415/http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |archivedate=7 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] one of the Swiss jurors made a great show of presenting his votes with flamboyant gestures. This system was retired the next year.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that Switzerland had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1956|work=Eurovision.tv}}</ref> From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical [[scoreboard]] to the side of the stage.

Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language.

In addition, only the jury points are announced by country.  The televoting results are announced in aggregate, from lowest-scoring country to highest. After the winner has been announced, the televoting points from the country where the contest is watched from are briefly seen on screen.\n\n==== Ties for first place ====\n\nIn {{ESCYr|1969}}, four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.<ref name=\"ESC1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ESC1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nUnder the current rules, in the event of more than one country scoring the same total number of points, a count is made of the numbers of countries who awarded points to each of the tied countries, and the one who received points from the most countries is declared the winner. If the numbers are still tied, it is counted how many sets of maximum points (12 points) each country received. If there is still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are compared\u2014and then the numbers of 8-point scores, all the way down the list. In the extremely unlikely event of there then ''still'' being a tie for first place, the song performed earliest in the running order is declared the winner. Since 2008, the same tie-break rule now applies to ties for all places.<ref name=\"2009rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/esc2009rules.pdf|title=Rules for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|format=PDF|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nAs of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in {{ESCYr|1991}}, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, the rules did not include counting the numbers of countries awarding any points to these countries' songs, but began with tallying up the numbers of 12-point scores awarded. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points. However, because Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current rule been in play, France would have won instead.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\n\nEach participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.<ref name=\"2009rules\"/> From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> Three major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999.

Several relegation or qualification systems have been tried to limit the number of countries participating in the contest at one time. Thus the 1993 Contest introduced two new features: first, a pre-selection competition was held in [[Ljubljana]] in which seven [[Eastern Bloc|new countries]] fought for three places in the international competition. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia took part in ''[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]''; and the three former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, qualified for a place in the international final.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1993|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Also to be introduced that year was \"relegation\": the lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were not invited in 1994, to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-selection into the 1994 Contest.

Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.\n\nThe total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.\n\nTo try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.<ref name=\"juryconfirmed\">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |title=EBU confirms 50/50 vote for Eurovision Song Contest |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=8 December 2008 |publisher=''ESCToday'' |accessdate=8 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002140/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df= }}</ref> This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"Countries\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive%3A+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|title=Exclusive: 39 countries to be represented in Oslo|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=31 December 2009|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Cyprus and Greece, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions. \n\nAn overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. Together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. Result of such a study are presented in, <ref name=\"Mantzaris et al 2018\">Mantzaris, Alexander V., Rein, Samuel R. and Hopkins, Alexander D. \"[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-018-0020-2 Preference and neglect amongst countries in the Eurovision Song Contest.]\", ''Journal of Computational Social Science''  2018.</ref>.

This includes atmospheric [[air]], which is approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases, primarily [[argon]].<ref name=Brubakk /><ref name=noaa /><ref name=dan /> In the usual application, [[underwater diving]], nitrox is normally distinguished from air and handled differently.<ref name=dan/> The most common use of nitrox mixtures containing oxygen in higher proportions than atmospheric air is in [[scuba diving]], where the reduced [[partial pressure]] of nitrogen is advantageous in reducing nitrogen uptake in the [[Tissue (biology)|body's tissues]], thereby extending the practicable underwater dive time by reducing the [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]] requirement, or reducing the risk of [[decompression sickness]] (also known as ''the bends'').<ref name=Lambertsen1994 />\n\nNitrox is used to a lesser extent in [[surface-supplied diving]], as these advantages are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of [[decompression illness]], usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous.<ref name=\"Treatment tables\" /> Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of [[oxygen toxicity]] and fire.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\nThough not generally referred to as nitrox, an oxygen-enriched air mixture is routinely provided at normal surface ambient pressure as [[oxygen therapy]] to patients with compromised respiration and circulation.\n\n==Physiological effects under pressure==\n===Decompression benefits===\n{{see also|Decompression (diving)|Decompression theory|Decompression practice}}\nReducing the proportion of nitrogen by increasing the proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of decompression sickness for the same dive profile, or allows extended dive times without increasing the need for [[decompression stop]]s for the same risk.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" /> The significant aspect of extended no-stop time when using nitrox mixtures is reduced risk in a situation where breathing gas supply is compromised, as the diver can make a direct ascent to the surface with an acceptably low risk of decompression sickness. The exact values of the extended no-stop times vary depending on the decompression model used to derive the tables, but as an approximation, it is based on the partial pressure of nitrogen at the dive depth. This principle can be used to calculate an equivalent air depth (EAD) with the same partial pressure of nitrogen as the mix to be used, and this depth is less than the actual dive depth for oxygen enriched mixtures. The equivalent air depth is used with air decompression tables to calculate decompression obligation and no-stop times.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" /> The [[Decompression theory#Goldman Interconnected Compartment Model|Goldman decompression model]] predicts a significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the PADI tables suggest).<ref name=\"Goldman 2013\" />\n\n===Nitrogen narcosis===\nControlled tests have not shown breathing nitrox to reduce the effects of [[nitrogen narcosis]], as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus one should not expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only to the use of nitrox.<ref name=\"Hesser1978\" /><ref name=Brubakk304 /><ref group=note>Oxygen has the potential to be 1.7 times more narcotic than nitrogen - see [[:File:Relative narcotic potency.gif|relevant narcotic potency of gases]]</ref> Nonetheless, there are people in the diving community who insist that they feel reduced narcotic effects at depths breathing nitrox. This may be due to a dissociation of the subjective and behavioural effects of narcosis.<ref name=\"Hamilton1995\" /> Although oxygen appears chemically more narcotic at the surface, relative narcotic effects at depth have never been studied in detail, but it is known that different gases produce different narcotic effects as depth increases. Helium has no narcotic effect, but results in [[High pressure nervous syndrome|HPNS]] when breathed at high pressures, which does not happen with gases that have greater narcotic potency. However, because of risks associated with [[Nitrox#Oxygen toxicity|oxygen toxicity]], divers do not usually use nitrox at greater depths where more pronounced narcosis symptoms are more likely to occur. For deep diving, [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] or [[heliox]] gases are typically used; these gases contain [[helium]] to reduce the amount of narcotic gases in the mixture.\n\n===Oxygen toxicity===\n{{main article|Oxygen toxicity}}\nDiving with and handling nitrox raise a number of potentially fatal dangers due to the high [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (ppO<sub>2</sub>).<ref name=noaa/><ref name=dan/> Nitrox is not a deep-diving gas mixture owing to the increased proportion of oxygen, which becomes [[oxygen toxicity|toxic]] when breathed at high pressure. For example, the maximum operating depth of nitrox with 36% oxygen, a popular [[recreational diving]] mix, is {{convert|29|m|ft}} to ensure a maximum ppO<sub>2</sub> of no more than {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}}. The exact value of the maximum allowed ppO<sub>2</sub> and [[maximum operating depth]] varies depending on factors such as the training agency, the type of dive, the breathing equipment and the level of surface support, with [[professional diving|professional divers]] sometimes being allowed to breathe higher ppO<sub>2</sub> than those recommended to [[recreational diving|recreational divers]].\n\nTo dive safely with nitrox, the diver must learn good [[buoyancy]] control, a vital part of scuba diving in its own right, and a disciplined approach to preparing, planning and executing a dive to ensure that the ppO<sub>2</sub> is known, and the maximum operating depth is not exceeded. Many dive shops, dive operators, and gas blenders require the diver to present a nitrox certification card before selling nitrox to divers.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSome training agencies, such as PADI and [[Technical Diving International]], teach the use of two depth limits to protect against oxygen toxicity. The shallower depth is called the \"maximum operating depth\" and is reached when the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas reaches {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}}.  The deeper depth, called the \"contingency depth\", is reached when the partial pressure reaches {{convert|1.6|bar|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Diving at or beyond this level exposes the diver to a greater risk of central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity. This can be extremely dangerous since its onset is often without warning and can lead to drowning, as the regulator may be spat out during convulsions, which occur in conjunction with sudden unconsciousness (general seizure induced by oxygen toxicity).\n\nDivers trained to use nitrox may memorise the [[acronym]] VENTID-C or sometimes ConVENTID, (which stands for '''V'''ision (blurriness), '''E'''ars (ringing sound), '''N'''ausea, '''T'''witching, '''I'''rritability,  '''D'''izziness, and '''C'''onvulsions). However, evidence from non-fatal oxygen convulsions indicates that most convulsions are not preceded by any warning symptoms at all.<ref name=\"bennett2003-375\" /> Further, many of the suggested warning signs are also symptoms of nitrogen narcosis, and so may lead to misdiagnosis by a diver. A solution to either is to ascend to a shallower depth.\n\n===Carbon dioxide retention===\nUse of nitrox may cause a reduced ventilatory response, and when breathing dense gas at the deeper limits of the usable range, this may result in carbon dioxide retention when exercise levels are high, with an increased risk of loss of consciousness.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\n===Other effects===\nThere is anecdotal evidence that the use of nitrox reduces post-dive fatigue,<ref name=scubaboardPoll /> particularly in older and or obese divers; however a double-blind study to test this found no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue.<ref name=Brubakk/><ref name=\"Harris et al 2003\" /> There was, however, some suggestion that post dive fatigue is due to sub-clinical decompression sickness (DCS) (i.e. micro bubbles in the blood insufficient to cause symptoms of DCS); the fact that the study mentioned was conducted in a dry chamber with an ideal decompression profile may have been sufficient to reduce sub-clinical DCS and prevent fatigue in both nitrox and air divers. In 2008, a study was published using wet divers at the same depth no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue was seen.<ref name=AAUS2008 />\n\nFurther studies with a number of different dive profiles, and also different levels of exertion, would be necessary to fully investigate this issue. For example, there is much better scientific evidence that breathing high-oxygen gases increases exercise tolerance, during aerobic exertion.<ref name=\"Anderson 2015\" /> Though even moderate exertion while breathing from the regulator is a relatively uncommon occurrence in recreational scuba, as divers usually try to minimize it in order to conserve gas, episodes of exertion while regulator-breathing do occasionally occur in recreational diving. Examples are surface-swimming a distance to a boat or beach after surfacing, where residual \"safety\" cylinder gas is often used freely, since the remainder will be wasted anyway when the dive is completed, and unplanned contingencies due to currents or buoyancy problems. It is possible that these so-far un-studied situations have contributed to some of the positive reputation of nitrox.\n\nA 2010 study using [[critical flicker fusion frequency]] and perceived fatigue criteria found that diver alertness after a dive on nitrox was significantly better than after an air dive.<ref name=\"Lafere et al 2010\" />\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Nitrox tables.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Enriched Air Nitrox diving tables, showing adjusted no-decompression times.]]\n\n===Underwater diving===\nEnriched Air Nitrox, nitrox with an oxygen content above 21%, is mainly used in [[scuba diving]] to reduce the proportion of nitrogen in the breathing gas mixture. The main benefit is reduced decompression risk.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" /> To a considerably lesser extent it is also used in surface supplied diving, where the logistics are relatively complex, similar to the use of other diving gas mixtures like [[heliox]] and [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]].\n\n===Therapeutic recompression===\n{{further|Hyperbaric treatment schedules|Therapeutic recompression}}\nNitrox50 is used as one of the options in the first stages of therapeutic recompression using the Comex CX 30 table for treatment of vestibular or general decompression sickness. Nitrox is breathed at 30&nbsp;msw and 24&nbsp;msw and the ascents from these depths to the next stop. At 18m the gas is switched to oxygen for the rest of the treatment.<ref name=\"Treatment tables\"/>\n\n===Medicine, mountaineering and unpressurised aircraft===\nThe use of oxygen at high altitudes or as [[oxygen therapy]] may be as supplementary oxygen, added to the inspired air, which would technically be a use of nitrox, blended on site, but this is not normally referred to as such, as the gas provided for the purpose is oxygen.\n\n==Terminology==\nNitrox is known by many names: Enriched&nbsp;Air&nbsp;Nitrox, Oxygen&nbsp;Enriched&nbsp;Air, Nitrox, EANx or Safe&nbsp;Air.<ref name=dan/><ref name=\"Elliott 1996\" /> Since the word is a compound contraction or coined word and not an acronym, it should not be written in all upper case characters as \"NITROX\",<ref name=\"dan\"/> but may be initially capitalized when referring to specific mixtures such as Nitrox32, which contains 68% nitrogen and 32% oxygen. When one figure is stated, it refers to the oxygen percentage, not the nitrogen percentage. The original convention, Nitrox68/32 became shortened as the first figure is redundant.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe term \"nitrox\" was originally used to refer to the breathing gas in a seafloor habitat where the oxygen has to be kept to a lower fraction than in air to avoid long term [[oxygen toxicity]] problems. It was later used by Dr Morgan Wells of NOAA for mixtures with an oxygen fraction higher than air, and has become a generic term for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen with any oxygen fraction,<ref name=\"dan\"/> and in the context of recreational and technical diving, now usually refers to a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with more than 21% oxygen.<ref name=dan/> \"Enriched Air Nitrox\" or \"EAN\", and \"Oxygen Enriched Air\" are used to emphasize richer than air mixtures.<ref name=dan/> In \"EANx\", the \"x\" was originally the x of nitrox,<ref name=noaa/><!--alternative interpretations have been suggested--> but has come to indicate the percentage of oxygen in the mix and is replaced by a number when the percentage is known; for example a 40% oxygen mix is called EAN40. The two most popular blends are EAN32 and EAN36, developed by NOAA for scientific diving, and also named Nitrox I and Nitrox II, respectively, or Nitrox68/32 and Nitrox64/36.<ref name=noaa/><ref name=dan/> These two mixtures were first utilized to the depth and oxygen limits for scientific diving designated by NOAA at the time.<ref name=Mastro1989 />\n\nThe term Oxygen Enriched Air (OEN) was accepted by the (American) scientific diving community, but although it is probably the most unambiguous and simply descriptive term yet proposed, it was resisted by the recreational diving community, sometimes in favour of less appropriate terminology.<ref name=\"dan\"/>\n\nIn its early days of introduction to non-technical divers, nitrox has occasionally also been known by detractors by less complimentary terms, such as \"devil gas\" or \"voodoo gas\" (a term now sometimes used with pride).<ref name=oxyhackers />\n\n[[American Nitrox Divers International]] (ANDI) uses the term \"SafeAir\", which they define as any oxygen-enriched air mixture with O<sub>2</sub> concentrations between 22% and 50% that meet their gas quality and handling specifications, and specifically claim that these mixtures are safer than normally produced breathing air.<ref name=\"SafeAir\" /> Considering the complexities and hazards of mixing, handling, analyzing, and using oxygen-enriched air, this name is considered inappropriate by those who consider that it is not inherently \"safe\", but merely has decompression advantages.<ref name=\"dan\"/>\n\nThe constituent gas percentages are what the [[gas blending|gas blender]] aims for, but the final actual mix may vary from the specification, and so a small flow of gas from the cylinder must be measured with an [[oxygen analyzer]], before the cylinder is used underwater.<ref name=\"Lippman and Mitchell 2005\" />\n\n===MOD===\n{{main article|Maximum operating depth}}\nMaximum Operating Depth (MOD) is the maximum safe depth at which a given nitrox mixture can be used. MOD depends on the allowed partial pressure of oxygen, which is related to exposure time and the acceptable risk assumed for central nervous system oxygen toxicity. Acceptable maximum ppO<sub>2</sub> varies depending on the application:<ref name=\"dan\" />\n*1.2 is often used in closed circuit rebreathers.\n*1.4 is recommended by several recreational training agencies for ordinary scuba diving.\n*1.5 is allowed for commercial diving in some jurisdictions.\n*1.6 is allowed for technical diving decompression stops, and is the recommended maximum according to NOAA<ref name=\"noaa\" />\nHigher values are used by commercial and military divers in special circumstances, often when the diver uses surface supplied breathing apparatus, or for treatment in a chamber, where the airway is relatively secure.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{see|Oxygen cleaning|Oxygen compatibility}}\n\n==Choice of mixture==\n{{See also|Scuba gas planning}}\n[[File:Decompression Dive-Preparation.JPG|300px|thumb|left|[[Technical diving|Technical divers]] preparing for a mixed-gas [[Decompression schedule|decompression dive]] in [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]]. Note the [[backplate and wing]] setup with [[Side mount diving|side mounted]] [[Diving cylinder#Purposes of diving cylinders|stage tanks]] containing EAN50 (left side) and pure [[oxygen]] (right side).]]\nThe two most common [[recreational diving]] nitrox mixes contain 32% and 36% oxygen, which have [[maximum operating depth]]s (MODs) of {{convert|34|m|ft}} and {{convert|29|m|ft}} respectively when limited to a maximum partial pressure of oxygen of {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on|lk=in}}. Divers may calculate an [[equivalent air depth]] to determine their decompression requirements or may use nitrox [[Dive tables|tables]] or a nitrox-capable [[dive computer]].<ref name=noaa/><ref name=dan/><ref name=\"Logan1961\" /><ref name=\"Berghage and McCraken 1979\" />\n\nNitrox with more than 40% oxygen is uncommon within recreational diving. There are two main reasons for this: the first is that all pieces of [[diving equipment]] that come into contact with mixes containing higher proportions of oxygen, particularly at high pressure, need special cleaning and servicing to reduce the risk of [[fire]].<ref name=noaa/><ref name=dan/> The second reason is that richer mixes extend the time the diver can stay underwater without needing [[decompression stop]]s far further than the duration permitted by the capacity of typical [[diving cylinder]]s. For example, based on the PADI nitrox recommendations, the maximum operating depth for EAN45 would be {{convert|21|m|ft}} and the maximum dive time available at this depth even with EAN36 is nearly 1 hour 15 minutes: a diver with a breathing rate of 20 litres per minute using twin 10-litre, 230-bar (about double 85 cu. ft.) cylinders would have completely emptied the cylinders after 1 hour 14 minutes at this depth.\n\nUse of nitrox mixtures containing 50% to 80% oxygen is common in [[technical diving]] as decompression gas, which by virtue of its lower partial pressure of inert gases such as nitrogen and helium, allows for more efficient (faster) elimination of these gases from the tissues than leaner oxygen mixtures.\n\nIn deep [[Scuba set#Types|open circuit]] technical diving, where [[Breathing gas#Oxygen|hypoxic]] gases are breathed during the bottom portion of the dive, a Nitrox mix with 50% or less oxygen called a \"travel mix\" is sometimes breathed during the beginning of the descent in order to avoid [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Normally, however, the most oxygen-lean of the diver's decompression gases would be used for this purpose, since descent time spent reaching a depth where bottom mix is no longer hypoxic is normally small, and the distance between this depth and the MOD of any nitrox decompression gas is likely to be very short, if it occurs at all.\n\n===Best mix===\nThe composition of a nitrox mix can be optimized for a given planned dive profile. This is termed \"Best mix\", for the dive, and provides the maximum no-decompression time compatible with acceptable oxygen exposure. An acceptable maximum partial pressure of oxygen is selected based on depth and planned bottom time, and this value is used to calculate the oxygen content of the best mix for the dive:<ref name=\"Becker\" />\n\n:<math>f_{\\text{O}_2,\\text{max}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{O}_2,\\text{max}}}{p} = \\frac{\\text{Maximum acceptable partial pressure of oxygen}}{\\text{Maximum ambient pressure of the dive}}</math>\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|Gas blending}}\n\nThere are several methods of production:<ref name=dan/><ref name=oxyhackers /><ref name=evil />  \n* Mixing by partial pressure: a measured pressure of [[oxygen]] is decanted into the cylinder and cylinder is \"topped up\" with air from the [[diving air compressor]]. This method is very versatile and requires relatively little additional equipment if a suitable compressor is available, but it is labour-intensive, and high partial pressures of oxygen are relatively hazardous.\n* Pre-mix decanting: the gas supplier provides large cylinders with popular mixes such as 32% and 36%. These may be further diluted with air to provide a larger range of mixtures.\n* Mixing by continuous blending: measured quantities of oxygen are introduced to air and mixed with it before it reaches the compressor inlet. The compressor and particularly the compressor oil, must be suitable for this service. If the resulting oxygen fraction is less than 40%, the cylinder and valve may not be required to be cleaned for oxygen service. Relatively efficient and quick compared to partial pressure blending, but requires a suitable compressor, and the range of mixes may be limited by the compressor specification.\n* Mixing by mass fraction: oxygen and air or nitrogen are added to a cylinder that is accurately weighed until the required mix is achieved. This method requires fairly large and highly accurate scales, otherwise it is similar to partial pressure blending, but insensitive to temperature variations.\n* [[Membrane method|Mixing by gas separation]]: a [[nitrogen]] permeable membrane is used to remove some of the smaller nitrogen molecules from low pressure air until the required mix is achieved. The resulting low pressure nitrox is then pumped into cylinders by a compressor. Limited range of mixes are possible, but the equipment is quick and easy to operate and relatively safe, as there is never high partial pressure oxygen involved.\n* [[Pressure swing adsorption]] requires relatively complex equipment, otherwise the advantages are similar to membrane separation.\n\n== Cylinder markings to identify contents ==\nAny [[diving cylinder]] containing a blend of gasses other than standard air is required by most diver training organizations, and some national governments,<ref name=SANS10019 /> to be clearly marked to indicate the current gas mixture. In practice it is common to use a printed adhesive label to indicate the type of gas (in this case nitrox), and to add a temporary label to specify the analysis of the current mix.\n\nTraining standards for nitrox certification suggest the composition must be verified by the diver by using an oxygen analyzer before use.\n\n==Regional standards and conventions==\n\n===European Union===\nWithin the EU, valves with M26x2 outlet thread are recommended for cylinders with increased oxygen content.<ref name=\"EN144\" /> Regulators for use with these cylinders require compatible connectors, and are not directly connectable with cylinders for compressed air.\n\n===Germany===\nA German standard specifies that any mixture with an oxygen content greater than atmospheric air must be treated as pure oxygen.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} A nitrox cylinder is specially cleaned and identified.<ref name=\"Becker\" /> The cylinder colour is overall white with the letter '''N''' on opposite sides of the cylinder.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The fraction of oxygen in the bottle is checked after filling and marked on the cylinder.\n\n=== South Africa ===\nSouth African National Standard 10019:2008 specifies the colour of all scuba cylinders as Golden yellow with French gray shoulder. This applies to all underwater breathing gases except medical oxygen, which must be carried in cylinders that are Black with a White shoulder. Nitrox cylinders must be identified by a transparent, self-adhesive label with green lettering, fitted below the shoulder.<ref name=SANS10019/> In effect this is green lettering on a yellow cylinder, with a gray shoulder. The composition of the gas must also be specified on the label. In practice this is done by a small additional self-adhesive label with the oxygen fraction, which is changed when a new mix is filled.\n\n=== USA ===\n[[File:Cylinder mod.jpg|thumb|right |Cylinder showing Nitrox band and sticker marked with MOD and O2%]]\nEvery nitrox cylinder should also have a sticker stating whether or not the cylinder is ''oxygen clean'' and suitable for partial pressure blending. Any oxygen-clean cylinder may have any mix up to 100% oxygen inside. If by some accident an oxygen-clean cylinder is filled at a station that does not supply gas to oxygen-clean standards it is then considered contaminated and must be re-cleaned before a gas containing more than 40% oxygen may again be added.<ref name=Butler1992 /> Cylinders marked as 'not oxygen clean' may only be filled with oxygen-enriched air mixtures from membrane or stick blending systems where the gas is mixed before being added to the cylinder, and to an oxygen fraction not exceeding 40% by volume.\n\n==Hazards==\n\n===Incorrect gas mix===\nUse of a gas mix which differs from the planned mix introduces an increased risk of decompression sickness or an increased risk of oxygen toxicity, depending on the error. It may be possible to simply recalculate the dive plan or set the dive computer accordingly, but in some cases the planned dive may not be practicable.\n\nMany training agencies such as [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]],<ref name=padi /> [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques|CMAS]], [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]] and [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the planned mix, the diver must either recalculate the dive plan with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under [[International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers|IANTD]] and [[American Nitrox Divers International|ANDI]] rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen fraction before taking delivery), and the calculated [[maximum operating depth]] for that mix. All of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations as each diver must use the specific cylinder they have checked out.\nIn South Africa, the national standard for handling and filling portable cylinders with pressurised gases (SANS 10019) requires that the cylinder be labelled with a sticker identifying the contents as nitrox, and specifying the oxygen fraction.<ref name=SANS10019/> Similar requirements may apply in other countries.\n\n===Fire and toxic cylinder contamination from oxygen reactions===\nPartial pressure blending using pure oxygen decanted into the cylinder before topping up with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the decanting process, which constitute a relatively high fire hazard. This procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and decanting equipment and cylinders which are clean for oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive.<ref name=oxyhackers /> Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen is often used to provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.\n\nAny gas which contains a significantly larger percentage of oxygen than air is a fire hazard, and such gases can react with hydrocarbons or lubricants and sealing materials inside the filling system to produce toxic gases, even if a fire is not apparent. Some organisations exempt equipment from oxygen-clean standards if the oxygen fraction is limited to 40% or less.<ref name=\"Rosales et al 2007\" />\n\nAmong recreational training agencies, only ANDI subscribes to the guideline of requiring oxygen cleaning for equipment used with more than 23% oxygen fraction. The USCG, NOAA, U.S. Navy, OSHA, and the other recreational training agencies accept the limit as 40% as no accident or incident has been known to occur when this guideline has been properly applied. Tens of thousands of recreational divers are trained each year and the overwhelming majority of these divers are taught the \"over 40% rule\".<ref name=noaa/><ref name=dan/><ref name=padi/> Most nitrox fill stations which supply pre-mixed nitrox will fill cylinders with mixtures below 40% without certification of cleanliness for oxygen service. <ref name=dan/> Luxfer cylinders specify oxygen cleaning for all mixtures exceeding 23.5% oxygen.<ref name=\"Luxfer 23.5%\" />\n\nThe following references for oxygen cleaning specifically cite the \"over 40%\" guideline that has been in widespread use since the 1960s, and consensus at the 1992 Enriched Air Workshop was to accept that guideline and continue the status quo.<ref name=\"dan\"/>\n*Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.430 (i) - Commercial Diving Operations\n*OSHA Oxygen Specifications 1910.420 (1)\n*NOAA Oxygen Specifications (appendix D)\n*U.S. Navy Oxygen Specifications U.S. MIL-STD-777E (SH) Note K-6-4, Cat. K.6\n*U.S. Coast Guard Oxygen Specifications Title 46: Shipping, revisions through 10-1-92. 197.452 Oxygen Cleaning 46 CFR 197.451\n\nMuch of the confusion appears to be a result of misapplying PVHO (pressure vessel for human occupancy) guidelines which prescribe a maximum ambient oxygen content of 25% when a human is sealed into a pressure vessel (chamber). The concern here is for a fire hazard to a living person who could be trapped in an oxygen-rich burning environment.<ref name=\"dan\"/>\n\nOf the three commonly applied methods of producing enriched air mixes - continuous blending, partial pressure blending, and membrane separation systems - only partial pressure blending would require the valve and cylinder components to be oxygen cleaned for mixtures with less than 40% oxygen. The other two methods ensure that the equipment is never subjected to greater than 40% oxygen content.\n\nIn a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder [[Amontons' Law|rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature]]. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically.  If the vessel contents are ignitable or a contaminant is present this event may result in a \"fireball\".<ref name=\"DAN\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1874, [[Henry Fleuss]] made what was possibly the first Nitrox dive using a rebreather.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\nIn 1911 [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Draeger]] of Germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a [[standard diving]] suit. This concept was produced and marketed as the DM20 oxygen rebreather system and the DM40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. The DM40 was rated for depths up to 40m.<ref name=\"Draegerwerk 1899\" />\n\n[[Christian J. Lambertsen]] proposed calculations for nitrogen addition to prevent oxygen toxicity in divers utilizing nitrogen-oxygen rebreather diving.<ref name=Lambertsen1941 />\n\nIn [[World War II]] or soon after, British commando [[frogman|frogmen]] and [[clearance diver]]s started occasionally diving with oxygen rebreathers adapted for semi-closed-circuit nitrox (which they called \"mixture\") diving by fitting larger cylinders and carefully setting the gas flow rate using a flow meter. These developments were kept secret until independently duplicated by civilians in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}<!--This is plausible, as it basically (badly) describes a semi-closed constant mass flow rebreather-->\n\nLambertson published a paper on nitrox in 1947.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\nIn the 1950s the [[United States Navy]] (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the US Navy Diving Manual.<ref name=usn />\n\nIn 1055, E. Lanphier described the use of nitrogen-oxygen diving mixtures, and the [[equivalent air depth]] method for calculating decompression from air tables.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, A. Galerne used on-line blending for commercial diving.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\nIn 1970, [[John Morgan Wells|Morgan Wells]], who was the first director of the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) Diving Center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. He introduced the concept of Equivalent Air Depth (EAD). He also developed a process for mixing oxygen and air which he called a continuous blending system.  For many years Wells' invention was the only practical alternative to [[partial pressure]] blending. In 1979 NOAA published Wells' procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual.<ref name=noaa/><ref name=dan/>\n\nIn 1985 [[Dick Rutkowski]], a former NOAA [[diving safety officer]], formed IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) and began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community.<ref name=Lang2006 />\n\nIn 1989, the Harbor Branch Oceanographic institution workshop addressed blending, oxygen limits and decompression issues.<ref name=\"Lang2006\" />\n\nIn 1991, Bove, Bennett and ''Skindiver'' magazine took a stand against nitrox use for recreational diving. The annual [[Diving Equipment Manufacturers Association|DEMA]] show (held in Houston, Texas that year) banned nitrox training providers from the show.  This caused a backlash, and when DEMA relented, a number of organizations took the opportunity to present nitrox workshops outside the show.<ref name=Lang2006 />\n\nIn 1992, the Scuba Diving Resources Group organised a workshop where some guidelines were established, and some misconceptions addressed.<ref name=Lang2006 />\n\nIn 1992 [[British Sub-Aqua Club|BSAC]] banned its members from using nitrox during BSAC activities.<ref name=\"BSACOK\" /> IAND's name was changed to the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers ([[IANTD]]), the T being added when the European Association of Technical Divers (EATD) merged with IAND.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the early 1990s, these agencies were teaching nitrox, but the main scuba agencies were not. Additional new organizations, including the [[American Nitrox Divers International]] (ANDI) - which invented the term \"Safe Air\" for marketing purposes - and [[Technical Diving International]] (TDI) were begun.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox.<ref name=NAUIhx />\n\nMeanwhile, diving stores were finding a purely economic reason to offer nitrox: not only was an entire new course and certification needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank fills with compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} With the new dive computers which could be programmed to allow for the longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the incentive for the sport diver to use the gas increased. \n\nIn 1993 ''Skin Diver'' magazine, the leading recreational diving publication at the time,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} published a three-part series arguing that nitrox was unsafe for sport divers.<ref group=note>A position which it would formally maintain until in 1995 magazine editor Bill Gleason was reported to say that nitrox was \"all right\".  ''Skin Diver'' would later go into bankruptcy.</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[DiveRite]] manufactured the first nitrox-compatible [[dive computer]], called the Bridge,<ref name=\"TDI manual\" /> the aquaCorps TEK93 conference was held in San Francisco, and a practicable oil limit of 0.1mg/m<sup>3</sup> for oxygen compatible air was set. The Canadian armed forces issued EAD tables with an upper PO<sub>2</sub> of 1.5 ATA.<ref name=Lang2006 />\n\nIn 1994 BSAC reversed its policy on Nitrox and announced BSAC nitrox training to start in 1995<ref name=BSACOK/>\n\nIn 1996, the [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors]] (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox.<ref name=padi/> While other mainline scuba organizations had announced their support of nitrox earlier,<ref name=BSACOK /> it was PADI's endorsement that established nitrox as a standard recreational diving option.<ref name=\"adc\" /><!--{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2015|reason=American Dive Center has no \"reputation for fact-checking and accuracy\" as needed for a reliable source; the statement is too strong to be based on the opinion of an unknown website}} Commented out, but left for reference.

Hamilton showed that over hundreds of thousands of nitrox dives, the DCS record is good. Nitrox had become popular with recreational divers, but not used much by commercial divers who tend to use surface supplied breathing apparatus. The OSHA accepted a petition for a variance from the commercial diving regulations for recreational scuba instructors.<ref name=Lang2006 /> \n\nThe 2001 edition of the ''NOAA Diving Manual'' included a chapter intended for Nitrox training.<ref name=Lang2006 />\n\n== In nature ==\nAt times in the geological past the Earth's atmosphere contained much more than 20% oxygen: e.g. up to 35% in the [[Upper Carboniferous]] period.

Erik was born at [[Honfleur]] in Normandy; his childhood home there is open to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musees-honfleur.fr/maison-satie.html|title=Maisons Satie|website=Musees-honfleur.fr|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref> When Satie was four years old, his family moved to Paris, his father having been offered a translator's job in the capital. After his mother's death in 1872, he was sent (at age 6), together with his younger brother, Conrad, back to Honfleur to live with his paternal grandparents. There he received his first music lessons from a local [[organist]]. In 1878, when he was 12 years old, his grandmother died, and the two brothers were reunited in Paris with their father, who remarried (a piano teacher) shortly afterwards. From the early 1880s onwards, Satie started publishing salon compositions by his step-mother and himself, among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.550305&catNum=550305&filetype=About+this+Recording&language=English|title=SATIE, E.: Piano Works (Selection) (K\u00f6rmendi)|website=Naxos.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Satie entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he was soon labelled untalented by his teachers.

After being sent home for two and a half years, he was readmitted to the Conservatoire at the end of 1885 (age 19), but was unable to make a much more favourable impression on his teachers than he had before, and, as a result, resolved to take up [[military service]] a year later. However, Satie's military career did not last very long; within a few months he was discharged after deliberately infecting himself with bronchitis.<ref> in: Mary E.

During their relationship, Satie composed the ''[[Danses gothiques]]'' as a means of calming his mind,<ref>Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'', Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 11, 157</ref> and Valadon painted a portrait of Satie, which she gave to him. After six months she moved away, leaving Satie broken-hearted. Afterwards, he said that he was left with \"nothing but an icy loneliness that fills the head with emptiness and the heart with sadness\".<ref name=\"F\u00f6reningen\"/> It is believed this was the only intimate relationship Satie ever had.<ref name=\"grove\" />\n\nIn 1893, Satie met the young [[Maurice Ravel]] for the first time,<ref>Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'', Cambridge University Press 1990, p. 250</ref> Satie's style emerging in the first compositions of the youngster. One of Satie's own compositions of that period, ''[[Vexations]]'', was to remain undisclosed until after his death. By the end of the year he had founded the {{Lang|fr|[[\u00c9glise M\u00e9tropolitaine d'Art de J\u00e9sus Conducteur]]}} (Metropolitan Art Church of Jesus the Conductor). As its only member, in the role of \"Parcier et Ma\u00eetre de Chapelle\", he started to compose a ''{{Lang|fr|Grande messe}}'' (later to become known as the ''[[Messe des pauvres]]''), and wrote a flood of letters, articles and pamphlets showing off his self-assuredness in religious and artistic matters. To give an example: he applied for membership in the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] twice, leaving no doubt in the application letter that the board of that organisation (presided over by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]) as much as owed him such membership. Such proceedings without doubt rather helped to wreck his popularity in the cultural [[The Establishment|establishment]].<ref>Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge University Press 1990 p.50</ref>  In 1895 he inherited some money, allowing him to have more of his writings printed, and to change from wearing a priest-like habit to being the \"Velvet Gentleman\".\n\n===Move to Arcueil===\n[[File:El bohemi by Ramon Casas.jpg|thumb|upright|''Satie, Moulin de la Galette'' (\"The Bohemian\"), [[Ramon Casas]], (1891)]]\nBy mid-1896, all of Satie's financial means had vanished, and he had to move to cheaper and much smaller lodgings, first at the {{Lang|fr|Rue Cortot}},<ref>{{openplaque|3265}}</ref> and two years later, after he had composed the two first sets of ''{{Lang|fr|[[Pi\u00e8ces froides]]}}'' in 1897, to [[Arcueil]], a suburb some five kilometres from the centre of Paris.<ref>Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge University Press 1990 p.6</ref>  During this period he re-established contact with his brother Conrad for numerous practical and financial matters, disclosing some of his inner feelings in the process. The letters to Conrad made it clear that he had set aside his religious ideas.\n\nFrom 1899 on, Satie started making money as a cabaret pianist, adapting over a hundred compositions of popular music for piano or piano and voice, adding some of his own. The most popular of these were ''{{Lang|fr|[[Je te veux]]}}'', text by Henry Pacory; ''{{Lang|fr|Tendrement}}'', text by Vincent Hyspa; ''{{Lang|fr|Poudre d'or}}'', a waltz; ''[[La Diva de l'Empire]]'', text by Dominique Bonnaud/Numa Bl\u00e8s; ''{{Lang|fr|Le Picadilly}}'', a march; ''{{Lang|fr|L\u00e9gende californienne}}'', text by Contamine de Latour (lost, but the music later reappears in ''{{Lang|fr|La belle excentrique}}''); and quite a few more, many of which have been lost. In his later years, Satie would reject all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature,<ref>Erik Satie in a 17 January 1911 letter to his brother Conrad, quoted in Volta 1989 and in Gillmor 1992 (Chronology p. xxix)</ref> but for the time being, it was an income.\n\nOnly a few compositions that Satie took seriously remain from this period: ''[[Jack in the Box (Satie)|Jack in the Box]]'', music to a [[pantomime]] by [[Jules Depaquit]] (called a \"{{Lang|fr|clownerie}}\" by Satie); ''{{Lang|fr|Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant}}'', a short comic opera on a serious theme, text by [[Patrice Contamine de Latour|\"Lord Cheminot\"]]; ''The Dreamy Fish'', piano music to accompany a lost tale by Cheminot;<ref>Steven Moore Whiting, ''Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall'', Oxford: Clarendon Press 1999, p.259</ref> and a few others that were mostly incomplete, hardly any of them staged, and none of them published at the time.\n\nBoth ''{{Lang|fr|Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant}}'' and ''The Dreamy Fish'' have been analysed by Ornella Volta as containing elements of competition with [[Claude Debussy]], of which Debussy was probably not aware, Satie not making this music public. Meanwhile, Debussy was having one of his first major successes with ''{{Lang|fr|[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]}}'' in 1902, leading a few years later to 'who-was-precursor-to-whom' debates between the two composers, in which Maurice Ravel would also get involved.\n\nIn October 1905, Satie enrolled in [[Vincent d'Indy]]'s [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]]<ref>Jane F. Fulcher, ''French Cultural Politics & Music: From the Dreyfus Affair to the First World War'', Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p.&nbsp;199.</ref> to study classical [[counterpoint]] while still continuing his cabaret work. Most of his friends were as dumbfounded as the professors at the Schola when they heard about his new plan to return to the classrooms, especially as d'Indy was an admiring pupil of [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], not particularly favoured by Satie. Satie would follow these courses at the Schola, as a respected pupil, for more than five years, receiving a first (intermediate) diploma in 1908. Some of his classroom counterpoint-exercises, such as the ''{{Lang|fr|D\u00e9sespoir agr\u00e9able}}'', were published after his death. Another summary, of the period prior to the Schola, also appeared in 1911: the ''[[Trois morceaux en forme de poire]]'', which was a kind of compilation of the best of what he had written up to 1903.\n\nSomething that becomes clear through these published compilations is that Satie did not so much reject [[Romanticism]] and its exponents like [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], but that he rejected certain aspects of it. From his first composition to his last, he rejected the idea of [[musical development]],<ref>John Williamson, ''Words and Music'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2005), p.&nbsp;161.</ref> in the strict definition of this term: the intertwining of different themes in a development section of a [[sonata form]]. As a result, his contrapuntal and other works were very short; the \"new, modern\" [[Fugue]]s do not extend further than the exposition of the theme(s). Generally, he would say that he did not think it permitted that a composer take more time from his public than strictly necessary.<ref>[https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/osu1299643553/] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pianonoise.com/Composer.Satie.htm|title=Satie|website=wianonoise.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref> Also [[Melodrama]], in its historical meaning of the then popular romantic genre of \"spoken words to a background of music\", was something Satie avoided. His 1913 ''[[Le pi\u00e8ge de M\u00e9duse]]'' could be seen as an absurdist spoof of that genre.\n\nIn the meantime, other changes had also taken place: Satie was a member of a radical socialist party (he later switched his membership to the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] in that area after December 1920),<ref>{{cite book|title=Satie the Composer|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521350372|page=233|author=Robert Orledge|quote=As Satie's career progressed, he moved further and further towards the left. As early as 1908 he was an active member of the Radical-Socialist Committee in Arcueil, and he joined the official Socialist Party on the day after the assassination of [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (31 July 1914), switching to the Communist Party after the Congress of Tours in December 1920.}}</ref> and had socialised with the Arcueil community: amongst other things, he had been involved in the \"{{Lang|fr|Patronage la\u00efque}}\" work for children.<ref>Vincent Lajoinie, ''Erik Satie: L'Age d'Homme''{{Full|date=October 2017}}<!--Place, publisher, ISBN needed.--> (1985) 443 S. 8\u00b0 p.110</ref> He also changed his appearance to that of the 'bourgeois functionary' with bowler hat, umbrella, etc. He channelled his medieval interests into a peculiar secret [[hobby]]: in a filing cabinet he maintained a collection of imaginary buildings, most of them described as being made out of some kind of metal, which he drew on little cards. Occasionally, extending the game, he would publish anonymous small announcements in local journals, offering some of these buildings, e.g., a \"castle in lead\", for sale or rent.\n\nA rare [[autochrome]] photograph of Satie exists that dates from 1911. It was reproduced on the cover of [[Robert Orledge]]'s second book on the composer, ''Satie Remembered'' (1995),<ref>{{cite book|author=Orledge, Robert|title=Satie Remembered|isbn=9781574670011|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date= August 28, 1995|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/satie-remembered-robert-orledge/1002046202?ean=9781574670011\n}}</ref> but where this autochrome was found has not been made known.\n\n=== Later life ===\n[[File:Satie autoportret Projet Buste 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketch for a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of himself, by Satie, 1913]]\nStarting in 1912, Satie's new humorous miniatures for piano became very successful, and he wrote and published many of these over the next few years (most of them premiered by the pianist [[Ricardo Vi\u00f1es]]). His habit of accompanying the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks was now well established, so that a few years later he had to insist that these not be read out during performances<!-- avoiding \"Melodrama\" genre! -->. He wrote in the first edition of ''Heures s\u00e9culaires et instantan\u00e9es'', \"To whom it may concern: 'I forbid anyone to read the text aloud during the musical performance. Ignorance of my instructions will incur my righteous indignation against the presumptuous culprit. No exception will be allowed.'\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=John|title=Words and music|publisher=Liverpool University Press|location=Liverpool|year=2005|isbn=9780853236191|page=176}}</ref> He had mostly stopped using [[barline]]s by this time. In some ways, these compositions were very reminiscent of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s compositions from the final years of his life,<ref>Robert Orledge, ''Satie the Composer'' (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990): p.&nbsp;235.</ref> grouped under the name [[P\u00e9ch\u00e9s de vieillesse]].\n\nHowever, the acceleration in Satie's life did not come so much from the success of his new piano pieces; it was Ravel who inadvertently triggered the characteristics of Satie's remaining years and thus influenced the successive progressive artistic and cultural movements that rapidly manifested themselves in Paris over the following years. Paris was seen as the artistic capital of the world, and the beginning of the new century appeared to have set many minds on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://girlsguidetoparis.com/french-culture-vive-la-belle-epoque/|title=French Culture: Vive la Belle Epoque|date=24 April 2014|website=Girlsguidetoparis.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref> In 1910 the \"{{Lang|fr|Jeunes Rav\u00ealites}}\", a group of young musicians around Ravel, proclaimed their preference for Satie's earlier work from before the Schola period, reinforcing the idea that Satie had been a precursor of Debussy.\n\nAt first, Satie was pleased that at least some of his works were receiving public attention, but when he realised that this meant that his more recent work was overlooked or dismissed, he looked for other young artists who related better to his more recent ideas, so as to have better mutual support in creative activity. Thus, young artists such as [[Alexis Roland-Manuel|Roland-Manuel]], and later [[Georges Auric]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], started to receive more of his attention than the \"{{Lang|fr|Jeunes}}\".\n\nAs a result of his contact with Roland-Manuel, Satie again began publicising his thoughts, with far more irony than he had done before (amongst other things, the ''{{Lang|fr|M\u00e9moires d'un amn\u00e9sique}}'' and ''{{Lang|fr|Cahiers d'un mammif\u00e8re}}'').<ref>English translations of these pieces were published in ''A Mammal's Notebook'', see [[#Sources|Sources]] section below.{{Failed verification|date=October 2017}}<!--Nothing of this title in the mentioned section, and it should be referenced by author, if any.--></ref>\n\nWith Jean Cocteau, whom he had first met in 1915,<ref>Elliott Antokoletz, ''A History of Twentieth-Century Music in a Theoretic-Analytical Context'', Routledge 2014 p.208</ref> Satie started work on incidental music for a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', resulting in the ''[[Cinq grimaces pour Le songe d'une nuit d'\u00e9t\u00e9]]''. From 1916, he and Cocteau worked on the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', which was premiered in 1917 by [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], with sets and costumes by [[Pablo Picasso]], and choreography by [[L\u00e9onide Massine]]. Through Picasso, Satie also became acquainted with other [[cubism|cubists]], such as [[Georges Braque]], with whom he would work on other, aborted, projects.\n\n[[File:Erik Satie composer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Erik Satie'', by Donald Sheridan]]\n\nWith [[Georges Auric]], [[Louis Durey]], [[Arthur Honegger]], and [[Germaine Tailleferre]], Satie formed the [[Les Six|Nouveaux jeunes]], shortly after writing ''Parade''. Later, the group was joined by [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Darius Milhaud]]. In September 1918, Satie&nbsp;\u2013 giving little or no explanation&nbsp;\u2013 withdrew from the {{Lang|fr|Nouveaux jeunes}}. Jean Cocteau gathered the six remaining members, forming the [[Les Six|Groupe des six]] (to which Satie would later have access, but later again would fall out with most of its members).\n\nFrom 1919, Satie was in contact with [[Tristan Tzara]], the initiator of the [[Dada]] movement. He became acquainted with other artists involved in the movement, such as [[Francis Picabia]] (later to become a [[surrealism|Surrealist]]), [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jean Hugo]] and [[Man Ray]], among others. On the day of his first meeting with Man Ray, the two fabricated the artist's first [[readymade]]: ''[[The Gift (sculpture)|The Gift]]'' (1921). Satie contributed writing to the Dadaist publication ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''. In the first months of 1922, he was surprised to find himself entangled in the argument between Tzara and [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] about the true nature of avant-garde art, epitomised by the failure of the Congr\u00e8s de Paris. Satie originally sided with Tzara, but managed to maintain friendly relations with most players in both camps. Meanwhile, an \"{{Lang|fr|Ecole d'Arcueil}}\" had formed around Satie, taking the name from the relatively remote district of Paris where Satie lived;<ref>Anderson, Keith, ''Sleeve Notes The Best of Erik Satie'', Naxos 8.556688</ref> it included young musicians such as [[Henri Sauguet]], [[Maxime Jacob]], [[Roger D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re]] and [[Henri Cliquet-Pleyel]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161223074200/http://classic-intro.net/introductionalamusique/vingtieme4-1.html] </ref>\n\n{{unref|list|date=June 2018}}\nOther work and episodes in this last period of Satie's life:\n* Since 1911 he had been on friendly terms with [[Igor Stravinsky]], about whom he would later write articles.\n* ''[[Le Pi\u00e8ge de M\u00e9duse|Le pi\u00e8ge de M\u00e9duse]]'' (1913) had a unique position in Satie's [[Work of art|oeuvre]], as it was a stage work conceived and composed seemingly without any collaboration with other artists.\n* ''[[Sports et divertissements]]'' was a kind of multi-media project, in which Satie provided piano music to drawings made by [[Charles Martin (artist)|Charles Martin]]. The work was composed in 1914, but not published or performed until the early 1920s. The individual pieces are characteristic Satie \"miniatures\": in all, there are twenty pieces - none over two minutes in length, and some as short as 15 seconds.\n* He got in trouble over an insulting postcard he had written to one of his critics shortly after the premiere of ''Parade''; he was condemned to a week of imprisonment, but was finally released as a result of the (financial) intercession of [[Winnaretta Singer]], Princess Edmond de Polignac.\n* Singer, who had learnt Ancient Greek when she was over 50, had commissioned a work on [[Socrates]] in October 1916; this would become his ''[[Vie de Socrate|Socrate]]'', which he presented early in 1918 to the Princess.\n* From 1917 Satie wrote five pieces of ''[[furniture music]]'' (\"Musique d'ameublement\") for different occasions.\n* From 1920, he was on friendly terms with the circles around [[Gertrude Stein]], amongst others, leading to the publication of some of his articles in ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'' (commissioned by Sibyl Harris).\n* Some works would originate under the patronage of the count Etienne de Beaumont, from 1922 onwards:\n** ''[[La statue retrouv\u00e9e]]'' (or \"Divertissement\"): another Satie-Cocteau-Picasso-Massine collaboration.\n** ''[[Ludions]]'': a setting of [[nonsense verse|nonsense rhyme]] by [[L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue]]\n** ''[[Mercure (ballet)|Mercure]]'': the subtitle of this piece (\"Poses plastiques\") suggests it might have been intended rather as an emulation of the [[tableau vivant]] genre than as an actual ballet, the \"tableaux\" being cubist, by Picasso (and Massine).\n* During his final years Satie travelled; for example, in 1924 to Belgium, invited by Paul Collaer, and to [[Monte Carlo]] for the premiere of a work on which he had collaborated.\n\nSatie's last compositions were two 1924 ballets. ''[[Mercure (ballet)|Mercure]]'' reunited him with Picasso and Massine for a mythological spoof produced by Count \u00c9tienne de Beaumont's Soir\u00e9es de Paris, and he wrote the \"{{Lang|fr|instantaneist}}\" ballet ''{{Lang|fr|[[Rel\u00e2che (ballet)|Rel\u00e2che]]}}'' in collaboration with Picabia, for the {{Lang|fr|[[Ballets su\u00e9dois]]}} of [[Rolf de Mar\u00e9]]. In a simultaneous project, Satie added music to the surrealist film ''{{Lang|fr|[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]}}'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], which was given as an intermezzo for ''{{Lang|fr|Rel\u00e2che}}''.\n\nAfter years of heavy drinking (including consumption of [[absinthe]]),<ref>{{cite book|title=Forgotten English|author=Jeffrey Kacirk|date=2009|isbn=978-0688166366|publisher=William Morrow Paperbacks}}</ref> Satie died at age 59, on 1 July 1925 from [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050225235640/http://humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=c&p=a&a=i&ID=753] </ref> He is buried in the cemetery in Arcueil.

They were first studied by [[Giulio Carlo de' Toschi di Fagnano|Giulio Fagnano]] and [[Leonhard Euler]] ({{Circa|1750}}).  Modern mathematics defines an \"elliptic integral\" as any [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}} which can be expressed in the form\n\n: <math> f(x) = \\int_{c}^{x} R \\left(t, \\sqrt{P(t)} \\right) \\, dt, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''R''}} is a [[rational function]] of its two arguments, {{math|''P''}} is a [[polynomial]] of degree 3 or 4 with no repeated roots, and {{math|''c''}} is a constant.\n\nIn general, integrals in this form cannot be expressed in terms of [[elementary function]]s. Exceptions to this general rule are when {{math|''P''}} has repeated roots, or when {{math|''R''(''x'',''y'')}} contains no odd powers of {{math|''y''}}.  However, with the appropriate [[Integration by reduction formulae|reduction formula]], every elliptic integral can be brought into a form that involves integrals over rational functions and the three [[Legendre form|Legendre canonical form]]s (i.e. the elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind).\n\nBesides the Legendre form given below, the elliptic integrals may also be expressed in [[Carlson symmetric form]]. Additional insight into the theory of the elliptic integral may be gained through the study of the [[Schwarz\u2013Christoffel mapping]]. Historically, [[elliptic functions]] were discovered as inverse functions of elliptic integrals.\n\n==Argument notation==\n''Incomplete elliptic integrals'' are functions of two arguments; ''complete elliptic integrals'' are functions of a single argument. These arguments are expressed in a variety of different but equivalent ways (they give the same elliptic integral). Most texts adhere to a canonical naming scheme, using the following naming conventions.\n\nFor expressing one argument:\n* {{math|''\u03b1''}}, the ''[[modular angle]]''\n* {{math|''k'' {{=}} sin ''\u03b1''}}, the ''elliptic modulus'' or ''[[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]''\n* {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''k''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} sin<sup>2</sup> ''\u03b1''}}, ''the parameter''\n\nEach of the above three quantities is completely determined by any of the others (given that they are non-negative). Thus, they can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe other argument can likewise be expressed as {{math|''\u03c6''}}, the ''amplitude'', or as {{math|''x''}} or {{math|''u''}},  where {{math|''x'' {{=}} sin ''\u03c6'' {{=}} sn ''u''}} and {{math|sn}} is one of the [[Jacobian elliptic functions]].\n\nSpecifying the value of any one of these quantities determines the others.  Note that {{math|''u''}} also depends on {{math|''m''}}.  Some additional relationships involving ''u'' include\n\n: <math>\\cos \\varphi = \\operatorname{cn} u, \\quad \\textrm{and} \\quad \\sqrt{1 - m \\sin^2 \\varphi} = \\operatorname{dn} u.</math>\n\nThe latter is sometimes called the ''delta amplitude'' and written as {{math|\u0394(''\u03c6'') {{=}} dn ''u''}}.  Sometimes the literature also refers to the ''complementary parameter'', the ''complementary modulus,'' or the ''complementary modular angle''. These are further defined in the article on [[quarter period]]s.\n\n==Incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind==\nThe '''incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind''' {{math|F}} is defined as\n\n: <math> F(\\varphi,k) = F\\left(\\varphi \\,|\\, k^2\\right) = F(\\sin \\varphi ; k) = \\int_0^\\varphi \\frac {d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - k^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}}.</math>\n\nThis is the trigonometric form of the integral; substituting {{math|''t'' {{=}} sin ''\u03b8''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} sin ''\u03c6''}}, one obtains [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]'s form:\n\n: <math> F(x ; k) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{\\left(1 - t^2\\right)\\left(1 - k^2 t^2\\right)}}.</math>\n\nEquivalently, in terms of the amplitude and modular angle one has:\n\n: <math> F(\\varphi \\setminus \\alpha) = F(\\varphi, \\sin \\alpha) = \\int_0^\\varphi \\frac{d \\theta}{\\sqrt{1-(\\sin \\theta \\sin \\alpha)^2}}.</math>\n\nIn this notation, the use of a vertical bar as delimiter indicates that the argument following it is the \"parameter\" (as defined above), while the backslash indicates that it is the modular angle. The use of a semicolon implies that the argument preceding it is the sine of the amplitude:\n\n: <math> F(\\varphi, \\sin \\alpha) = F\\left(\\varphi \\,|\\, \\sin^2 \\alpha\\right) = F(\\varphi \\setminus \\alpha) = F(\\sin \\varphi ; \\sin \\alpha).</math>\n\nThis potentially confusing use of different argument delimiters is traditional in elliptic integrals and much of the notation is compatible with that used in the reference book by [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] and that used in the integral tables by [[Gradshteyn and Ryzhik]].\n\nWith {{math|''x'' {{=}} sn(''u'',''k'')}} one has:\n\n: <math>F(x;k) = u;</math>\n\nthus, the [[Jacobian elliptic functions]] are inverses to the elliptic integrals.\n\n===Notational variants===\nThere are still other conventions for the notation of elliptic integrals employed in the literature. The notation with interchanged arguments, {{math|''F''(''k'',''\u03c6'')}}, is often encountered; and similarly {{math|''E''(''k'',''\u03c6'')}} for the integral of the second kind. [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] substitute the integral of the first kind, {{math|''F''(''\u03c6'',''k'')}}, for the argument {{math|''\u03c6''}} in their definition of the integrals of the second and third kinds, unless this argument is followed by a vertical bar: i.e. {{math|''E''(''F''(''\u03c6'',''k'') {{!}} ''k''<sup>2</sup>)}} for  {{math|''E''(''\u03c6'' {{!}} ''k''<sup>2</sup>)}}. Moreover, their complete integrals employ the ''parameter'' {{math|''k''<sup>2</sup>}} as argument in place of the modulus {{math|''k''}}, i.e. {{math|''K''(''k''<sup>2</sup>)}} rather than {{math|''K''(''k'')}}.

Churches had been planted in the Roman provinces of [[Galatia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaia]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. Paul, considering his task complete, wanted to preach the gospel in [[Early centers of Christianity#Seville|Spain]], where he would not \"build upon another man\u2019s foundation\".{{Bibleref2c|Rom|15:20|31}}<ref name=\"Bruce, 11-12\">Bruce, 11\u201312</ref> This allowed him to visit Rome on the way, a long-time ambition of his.

First, Paul was a [[Hellenistic Jew]] with a [[Pharisaic]] background (see [[Gamaliel]]), integral to his identity: see [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] for details. His concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter.

He appears to be responding to a \"heckler\" (probably an imaginary one based on Paul's encounters with real objections in his previous preaching), and the letter is structured as a series of arguments. In the flow of the letter, Paul shifts his arguments, sometimes addressing the Jewish members of the church, sometimes the Gentile membership and sometimes the church as a whole.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Purposes of writing ==\nTo review the current scholarly viewpoints on the purpose of Romans, along with a bibliography, see ''Dictionary of Paul and His Letters''.<ref>s.v. \"Romans, Letter to the\"</ref> For a 16th-century \"Lollard\" reformer view, see the work of [[William Tyndale]].

The sum and whole cause of the writings of this epistle, is, to prove that a man is justified by faith only: which proposition whoso denieth, to him is not only this epistle and all that Paul writeth, but also the whole scripture, so locked up that he shall never understand it to his soul's health.

We are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul's former writings against the [[Judaizers]] in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] and [[2&nbsp;Corinthians]], that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world (see also [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|Antinomianism in the New Testament]] and [[Supersessionism]]).

Paul hopes that all Israelites will come to realize the truth{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|9:1\u20135|KJV}} since he himself was also an Israelite,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|11:1|KJV}} and had in the past been a persecutor of [[Early Christians]]. In {{Bibleref2|Romans|9\u201311}} Paul talks about how the nation of Israel has been cast away, and the conditions under which Israel will be God's chosen nation again: when Israel returns to its faith, sets aside its unbelief.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|11:19\u201324|KJV}}\n\nIn {{Bibleref2|Romans|7:1|KJV}}, Paul says that humans are under the law while we live: \"Know ye not...that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?\" However, Jesus' death on the cross makes believers dead to the law ({{Bibleref2-nb|Rom|7:4|KJV}}, \"Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the [[body of Christ]]\"), according to [[Antinomianism#Pauline passages supporting antinomianism|an antinomistic interpretation]].\n\n===Transformation of believers ([[Romans 12|12]] [[Romans 15|\u201315:13]])===\nFrom chapter 12 through the first part of chapter 15, Paul outlines how the [[Gospel]] transforms believers and the behaviour that results from such a transformation. This transformation is described as a \"renewing of your mind\" (12:2),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&c=12&t=NASB#s=t_conc_1058002|title=Blue Letter Bible|work=Blue Letter Bible}}</ref> a transformation that [[Douglas J.

Christians are no longer under the law, that is, no longer bound by the law of Moses,<ref>[[Douglas J. Moo]], ''Romans: The NIV Application Commentary: From Biblical Text to Contemporary Life'' (Zondervan, 2000), 399.</ref> but under the grace of God, see [[Law and grace]]. We do not need to live under the law because to the extent our minds have been renewed, we will know \"almost instinctively\" what God wants of us. The law then provides an \"objective standard\" for judging progress in the \"lifelong process\" of our mind's renewal.<ref>Douglas J. Moo, ''The Epistle to the Romans'' (Eerdmans, 1996), 756\u2013758.</ref>\n\nTo the extent they have been set free from [[sin]] by renewed minds (Romans 6:18),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&c=6&t=NASB&ss=1#s=t_conc_1052018|title=Blue Letter Bible|work=Blue Letter Bible}}</ref> believers are no longer bound to sin. Believers are free to live in obedience to God and love everybody. As Paul says in Romans 13:10, \"love (\u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7) worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&c=13&t=KJV&ss=1#s=1059010|title=Blue Letter Bible|work=Blue Letter Bible}}</ref>\n\n==== Obedience to earthly powers (13:1\u20137) ====\nThe fragment in Romans 13:1\u20137 dealing with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some, for example James Kallas,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140424030124/http://www.swordandploughshare.com/main-blog/2010/9/30/romans-131-7-an-interpolation.html The Sword and the Ploughshare ''Romans 13:1\u20137 an Interpolation?'']</ref> to be an [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].<ref>[http://hodos.org/romans/Paul%20and%20Empire%20-%20book%20report.htm Review of the book ''Paul and Empire \u2013 Religion and Power in Roman Imperial Society'' (Edited by Richard A.

[[Paul Tillich]] accepts the historical authenticity of Romans 13:1\u20137, but claims it has been misinterpreted by churches with an anti-revolutionary bias:\n<blockquote>One of the many politico-theological abuses of biblical statements is the understanding of Paul\u2019s words [Romans 13:1\u20137] as justifying the anti-revolutionary bias of some churches, particularly the Lutheran. But neither these words nor any other New Testament statement deals with the methods of gaining political power.

One-third of the twenty-one Christians identified in the greetings are [[Paul the Apostle and women|women]], some of whom played an important role in the early church at Rome. Additionally, none of these Christians answer to the name [[Saint Peter|Peter]], although according to the [[History of the Catholic Church|Catholic tradition]], he had been ruling as [[Pope]] in Rome for about 25 years. Possibly related was the [[Incident at Antioch]] between Paul and Cephas.\n* Personal greetings ([[Romans 16|16:1\u201323]] [24])\n* Closing [[doxology]] ([[Romans 16|16:25\u201327]])\n\n== Hermeneutics ==\n{{Main|Biblical hermeneutics}}\n\n=== Catholic interpretation ===\n{{Main|Sola gratia}}\n\nRoman Catholics accept the necessity of faith for salvation but point to {{Bibleref2|Romans|2:5\u201311|KJV}} for the necessity of living a [[Good works|virtuous life]] as well:<ref>For an authoritative discussion of the Catholic viewpoint, see ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', s.v. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13156a.htm \"Epistle to the Romans\"]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nBut by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality.\n</blockquote>\n\nThroughout his writings, St. Augustine strongly affirms the Catholic understanding of this and other such Scriptural admonitions. In his sermons to his Catholic congregations, he is especially careful to warn them against an inordinate desire for a complete assurance of salvation. In his ''Exposition of Psalm 147'' for example, he states:<ref>''Works, Expositions of the Psalms (121\u2013150)'', 2004, New City Press, {{ISBN|1-56548-210-7}} {{ISBN|9781565482104}}, Part 3, volume, 20, p. 446.[https://books.google.com/books?id=pcwHg1EszuQC&pg=PA446&dq=%22ought+to+be+secure+only+when+they+have+dominated+this+world%E2%80%99s+lusts%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22ought%20to%20be%20secure%20only%20when%20they%20have%20dominated%20this%20world%E2%80%99s%20lusts%22&f=false]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The gospel warned us, \"Be on the watch for the last day, the day when the Son of Man will come,\" because it will spell disaster for those it finds secure as they are now \u2013 secure for the wrong reasons, I mean, secure in the pleasures of this world, when they ought to be secure only when they have ''dominated this world's lusts''. The apostle certainly prepares us for that future life in words of which I also reminded you on that occasion.</blockquote>\n\nAgain, in his ''Exposition of Psalm 85'', Augustine is perhaps even more specific:<ref>''Works, Expositions of the Psalms (73\u201398)'', 2002 John E.

When we do find ourselves wanting it, what we are looking for is bodily sluggishness rather than personal security.</blockquote>\n\nCatholics would also look to the passage in Romans 8:13 for evidence that justification by faith is only valid so long as it is combined with obedient cooperation with The Holy Spirit, and the passage in Romans 11:22 to show that the Christian can lose their justification if they turn away from cooperating with The Holy Spirit and reject Christ through mortal sin.\n\n=== Protestant interpretation ===\n{{Main|Sola fide}}\n\nIn the Protestant interpretation, the New Testament epistles (including Romans), describes salvation as coming from faith and not from righteous actions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Concerning_Christian_Liberty|title=Concerning Christian Liberty|last=Luther|first=Martin}}</ref> For example, Romans {{Bibleref2-nb|Romans|4:2\u20135|9}} (underlining added):\n\n: 2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath ''whereof''<!--italics in source--> to glory; but <u>not before God</u>. 3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham <u>believed</u> God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5 But to him that <u>worketh not, but believeth</u> on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted unto him for righteousness.\n\nThey also point out{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} that in Romans <span class=plainlinks>{{Bibleref2|Romans|2|9|chapter 2:9}}</span>, Paul says that God will reward those who follow the law and then goes on to say that ''no one'' follows the law perfectly (see also [[Sermon on the Mount#Interpretations|Sermon on the Mount: Interpretation]]) Romans {{Bibleref2-nb|Rom|2:21\u201325|9}}:\n\n:21 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? 23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. 25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.\n\n[[Martin Luther]] described Paul's letter to the Romans as \"the most important piece in the New Testament.

[[Kingdom of England|England]] (1154\u20131189) and [[Duchy of Aquitaine|duchess of Aquitaine]] [[suo jure|in her own right]] (1137\u20131204). As a member of the [[Ramnulfids]] (House of [[Poitiers]]) rulers in southwestern France, she was one of the most powerful and wealthiest women in western Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]]. She was [[patron]] of literary figures such as [[Wace]], [[Beno\u00eet de Sainte-Maure]], and [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. She led armies several times in her life and was a leader of the [[Second Crusade]].\n\nAs duchess of Aquitaine, Eleanor was the most eligible bride in Europe. Three months after becoming duchess upon the death of her father, [[William X, Duke of Aquitaine|William X]], she married King [[Louis VII of France]], son of her guardian, [[King Louis VI]]. As [[queen of France]], she participated in the unsuccessful Second Crusade. Soon afterwards, Eleanor sought an [[annulment]] of her marriage,{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=106}} but her request was rejected by [[Pope Eugene III]].{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=122}} However, after the birth of her second daughter [[Alix of France, Countess of Blois|Alix]], Louis agreed to an annulment, as 15 years of marriage had not produced a son.{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=}} The marriage was annulled on 21 March 1152 on the grounds of [[consanguinity]] within the fourth degree. Their daughters were declared legitimate, custody was awarded to Louis, and Eleanor's lands were restored to her.\n\nAs soon as the annulment was granted, Eleanor became engaged to the [[duke of Normandy]], who became King [[Henry II of England]] in 1154. Henry was her third cousin and 11 years younger. The couple married on [[Whitsun]], 18 May 1152, eight weeks after the annulment of Eleanor's first marriage, in [[Poitiers Cathedral]]. Over the next 13 years, she bore eight children: five sons, three of whom became kings; and three daughters. However, Henry and Eleanor eventually became estranged. Henry imprisoned her in 1173 for supporting their son [[Henry the Young King|Henry]]'s revolt against him. She was not released until 6 July 1189, when Henry died and their second son, [[Richard the Lionheart]], ascended the throne.\n\nAs [[queen dowager]], Eleanor acted as [[regent]] while Richard went on the [[Third Crusade]]; on his return, Richard was captured and held prisoner. Eleanor lived well into the reign of her youngest son, [[John, King of England|John]]. She outlived all her children except for John and [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]].\n\n==Early life==\nEleanor's year of birth is not known precisely: a late 13th-century genealogy of her family listing her as 13 years old in the spring of 1137 provides the best evidence that Eleanor was perhaps born as late as 1124.{{sfnp|Turner|2009|p=28}} On the other hand, some chronicles mention a fidelity oath of some lords of Aquitaine on the occasion of Eleanor's fourteenth birthday in 1136. This, and her known age of 82 at her death make 1122 more likely the year of birth.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=13}} Her parents almost certainly married in 1121. Her birthplace may have been [[Poitiers]], [[Bordeaux]], or [[Nieul-sur-l'Autise]], where her mother and brother died when Eleanor was 6 or 8.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://alienor-aquitaine.org/bio/01_heritiere.htm Biographie d'Ali\u00e9nor d'Aquitaine]</ref>\n\nEleanor (or Ali\u00e9nor) was the oldest of three children of [[William X, Duke of Aquitaine]], whose glittering ducal court was renowned in early 12th-century Europe, and his wife, [[Aenor de Ch\u00e2tellerault]], the daughter of [[Aimery I, Viscount of Ch\u00e2tellerault]], and [[Dangereuse de l'Isle Bouchard]], who was [[William IX, Duke of Aquitaine|William IX]]'s longtime [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] as well as Eleanor's maternal grandmother. Her parents' marriage had been arranged by Dangereuse with her paternal grandfather William{{nbsp}}IX.\n\nEleanor is said to have been named for her mother Aenor and called ''Ali\u00e9nor'' from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''alia Aenor'', which means ''the other Aenor''. It became ''El\u00e9anor'' in the ''[[langues d'o\u00efl]]'' of northern France and ''Eleanor'' in English.{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=}} There was, however, another prominent Eleanor before her\u2014[[Eleanor of Normandy]], an aunt of [[William the Conqueror]], who lived a century earlier than Eleanor of Aquitaine. In Paris as the queen of France she was called Helienordis, her honorific name as written in the Latin epistles.\n\nBy all accounts, Eleanor's father ensured that she had the best possible education.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Eleanor came to learn arithmetic, the constellations, and history.{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=}} She also learned domestic skills such as household management and the needle arts of embroidery, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving.{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=}} Eleanor developed skills in conversation, dancing, games such as backgammon, checkers, and chess, playing the harp, and singing.{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=}} Although her native tongue was [[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]], she was taught to read and speak [[Latin language|Latin]], was well versed in music and literature, and schooled in riding, hawking, and hunting.{{sfnp|Horton|Simmons|2007}} Eleanor was extroverted, lively, intelligent, and strong-willed. In the spring of 1130 her four-year-old brother William Aigret and their mother died at the castle of Talmont on Aquitaine's Atlantic coast. Eleanor became the [[heir presumptive]] to her father's domains. The Duchy of Aquitaine was the largest and richest province of France. Poitou, where Eleanor spent most of her childhood, and Aquitaine together were almost one-third the size of modern France. Eleanor had only one other legitimate sibling, a younger sister named Aelith, also called [[Petronilla of Aquitaine|Petronilla]]. Her half brother Joscelin was acknowledged by William{{nbsp}}X as a son, but not as his heir. That she had another half-brother, William, has been discredited.{{sfnp|Chadwick|24 March 2013}} Later, during the first four years of Henry{{nbsp}}II's reign, her siblings joined Eleanor's royal household.\n\n===Inheritance===\nIn 1137 Duke William X left Poitiers for [[Bordeaux]] and took his daughters with him. Upon reaching Bordeaux, he left them in the charge of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux|archbishop of Bordeaux]], one of his few loyal [[vassal]]s. The duke then set out for the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral#History|Shrine of Saint James of Compostela]] in the company of other [[pilgrim]]s. He died, however, on [[Good Friday]] of that year (9{{nbsp}}April).\n\nEleanor, aged 12 to 15, then became the duchess of Aquitaine, and thus the most eligible heiress in Europe. As these were the days when kidnapping an heiress was seen as a viable option for obtaining a title, William dictated a [[will (law)|will]] on the very day he died that bequeathed his domains to Eleanor and appointed King [[Louis VI of France]] as her guardian.{{sfnp|Weir|2008}} William requested of the king that he take care of both the lands and the duchess, and find her a suitable husband.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} However, until a husband was found, the king had the legal right to Eleanor's lands. The duke also insisted to his companions that his death be kept a secret until Louis was informed; the men were to journey from Saint James of Compostela across the [[Pyrenees]] as quickly as possible to call at Bordeaux to notify the archbishop, then to make all speed to Paris to inform the king.\n\nThe king of France, known as Louis the Fat, was also gravely ill at that time, suffering from a bout of [[dysentery]] from which he appeared unlikely to recover. Yet despite his impending death, Louis's mind remained clear. His heir, [[Louis VII of France|Prince Louis]], had originally been destined for [[cadet branch|the monastic life of a younger son]] but had become the [[heir apparent]] when his older brother, [[Philip of France (1116\u20131131)|Philip]], died from a riding accident in 1131.{{sfnp|Swabey|2004}}\n\nThe death of William, one of the king's most powerful vassals, made available the most desirable [[duchy]] in France. While presenting a solemn and dignified face to the grieving Aquitainian messengers, Louis exulted when they departed. Rather than act as guardian to the duchess and duchy, he decided to marry the duchess to his 17-year-old heir and bring Aquitaine under the control of the French crown, thereby greatly increasing the power and prominence of France and its ruling family, the [[House of Capet]]. Within hours, the king had arranged for Prince Louis to be married to Eleanor, with Abbot [[Suger]] in charge of the wedding arrangements. Prince Louis was sent to Bordeaux with an escort of 500 knights, along with Abbot Suger, [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]], and Count Ralph.\n\n==First marriage==\n[[File:Louis vii and alienor.jpg|thumb|At left, a 14th-century representation of the wedding of Louis and Eleanor; at right, Louis leaving on Crusade.]]\n[[File:Vase de cristal d'Ali\u00e9nor.jpg|thumb|180px|Eleanor's grandfather, [[William IX of Aquitaine]], gave her this rock crystal vase, which she gave to Louis as a wedding gift. He later donated it to the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]]. This is the only surviving artifact known to have belonged to Eleanor.]]\n\nOn 25 July 1137 [[Louis VII of France]] and Eleanor were married in the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint-Andr\u00e9]] in Bordeaux by the archbishop of Bordeaux.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Immediately after the wedding, the couple were enthroned as duke and duchess of Aquitaine.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} However, there was a catch: the land would remain independent of France until Eleanor's oldest son became both king of the Franks and duke of Aquitaine. Thus, her holdings would not be merged with France until the next generation. As a wedding present she gave Louis a [[rock crystal vase]] [[:fr:vase de cristal d'Ali\u00e9nor|'''{fr}''']], currently on display at the [[Louvre]].{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}}{{sfnp|Swabey|2004}}{{sfnp|Kelly|1978}} Louis gave the vase to the [[Basilica of St Denis]]. This vase is the only object connected with Eleanor of Aquitaine that still survives.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=25}}\n\nLouis's tenure as count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine and Gascony lasted only a few days. Although he had been invested as such on 8 August 1137, a messenger gave him the news that Louis VI had died of dysentery on 1 August while Prince Louis and Eleanor were making a tour of the provinces. Thus he became King Louis VII of France. He and Eleanor were [[anointment|anointed]] and [[coronation|crowned]] [[List of French monarchs|king and queen of the Franks]] on Christmas Day of the same year.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}}{{sfnp|Wheeler|Parsons|2008}}\n\nPossessing a high-spirited nature, Eleanor was not popular with the staid northerners; according to sources, Louis's mother [[Adelaide of Maurienne]] thought her flighty and a bad influence. She was not aided by memories of [[Constance of Arles]], the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] wife of [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], tales of whose immodest dress and language were still told with horror.{{efn|[Adelaide] perhaps [based] her preconceptions on another southerner, Constance of Provence&nbsp;... tales of her allegedly immodest dress and language still continued to circulate among the sober Franks.{{sfnp|Meade|1977}} }} Eleanor's conduct was repeatedly criticized by church elders, particularly [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and Abbot Suger, as indecorous. The king was madly in love with his beautiful and worldly bride, however, and granted her every whim, even though her behavior baffled and vexed him. Much money went into making the austere Cit\u00e9 Palace in [[Paris]] more comfortable for Eleanor's sake.{{sfnp|Swabey|2004}}\n\n===Conflict===\nAlthough Louis was a pious man, he soon came into a violent conflict with [[Pope Innocent II]]. In 1141, the [[Archbishopric of Bourges]] became vacant, and the king put forward as a candidate one of his chancellors, Cadurc, while vetoing the one suitable candidate, [[Pierre de la Chatre]], who was promptly elected by the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[consecration|consecrated]] by the Pope. Louis accordingly bolted the gates of Bourges against the new bishop. The Pope, recalling similar attempts by William X to exile supporters of Innocent from Poitou and replace them with priests loyal to himself, blamed Eleanor, saying that Louis was only a child and should be taught manners. Outraged, Louis swore upon relics that so long as he lived Pierre should never enter Bourges. An [[interdict]] was thereupon imposed upon the king's lands, and Pierre was given refuge by [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]].\n\nLouis became involved in a war with Count Theobald by permitting [[Raoul I, Count of Vermandois]] and [[seneschal]] of France, to repudiate his wife [[El\u00e9onore of Blois]], Theobald's sister, and to marry [[Petronilla of Aquitaine]], Eleanor's sister. Eleanor urged Louis to support her sister's marriage to Count Raoul. Theobald had also offended Louis by siding with the Pope in the dispute over Bourges. The war lasted two years (1142\u201344) and ended with the occupation of [[Champagne]] by the royal army. Louis was personally involved in the assault and burning of the town of [[Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois|Vitry]]. More than a thousand people who sought refuge in the church there died in the flames. Horrified, and desiring an end to the war, Louis attempted to make peace with Theobald in exchange for his support in lifting the interdict on Raoul and Petronilla. This was duly lifted for long enough to allow Theobald's lands to be restored; it was then lowered once more when Raoul refused to repudiate Petronilla, prompting Louis to return to Champagne and ravage it once more.\n\nIn June 1144, the king and queen visited the newly built monastic church at Saint-Denis. While there, the queen met with Bernard of Clairvaux, demanding that he use his influence with the Pope to have the excommunication of Petronilla and Raoul lifted, in exchange for which King Louis would make concessions in Champagne and recognise Pierre de la Chatre as archbishop of Bourges. Dismayed at her attitude, Bernard scolded Eleanor for her lack of penitence and interference in matters of state. In response, Eleanor broke down and meekly excused her behaviour, claiming to be bitter because of her lack of children. In response, Bernard became more kindly towards her: \"My child, seek those things which make for peace. Cease to stir up the king against the Church, and urge upon him a better course of action. If you will promise to do this, I in return promise to entreat the merciful Lord to grant you offspring.\" In a matter of weeks, peace had returned to France: Theobald's provinces were returned and Pierre de la Chatre was installed as archbishop of Bourges. In April 1145, Eleanor gave birth to a daughter, [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne|Marie]].\n\nLouis, however, still burned with guilt over the massacre at Vitry and wished to make a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] to atone for his sins. In autumn 1145, [[Pope Eugene III]] requested that Louis lead a [[Crusades|Crusade]] to the [[Middle East]] to rescue the [[Crusader states|Frankish Kingdoms]] there from disaster. Accordingly, Louis declared on Christmas Day 1145 at Bourges his intention of going on a crusade.\n\n===Crusade===\nEleanor of Aquitaine also formally took up the cross symbolic of the [[Second Crusade]] during a sermon preached by Bernard of Clairvaux. In addition, she had been corresponding with her uncle [[Raymond of Poitiers|Raymond]], prince of the Crusader kingdom of [[Antioch]], who was seeking further protection from the French crown against the Saracens. Eleanor recruited some of her royal ladies-in-waiting for the campaign as well as 300 non-noble Aquitainian vassals. She insisted on taking part in the Crusades as the feudal leader of the soldiers from her duchy. The story that she and her ladies dressed as [[Amazons]] is disputed by historians, sometimes confused with the account of King Conrad's train of ladies during this campaign in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. She left for the Second Crusade from [[V\u00e9zelay]], the rumored location of [[Mary Magdalene]]'s grave in June 1147.\n\nThe Crusade itself achieved little. Louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. In eastern Europe, the French army was at times hindered by [[Manuel I Comnenus]], the [[Byzantine Emperor]], who feared that the Crusade would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. Notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at [[Constantinople]], Louis was f\u00eated and Eleanor was much admired. She was compared with [[Penthesilea]], mythical queen of the [[Amazons]], by the Greek historian [[Nicetas Choniates]]. He added that she gained the epithet ''chrysopous'' (golden-foot) from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed her robe. Louis and Eleanor stayed in the [[Philopation]] palace just outside the city walls.\n\n[[File:2nd Crusade council at Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Second Crusade]] council: [[Conrad III of Germany]], Eleanor's husband [[Louis VII of France]], and [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]]]\n\nFrom the moment the Crusaders entered [[Asia Minor]], things began to go badly. The king and queen were still optimistic&nbsp;\u2014the Byzantine Emperor had told them that the [[Conrad III of Germany|German King Conrad]] had won a great victory against a Turkish army when in fact the German army had been massacred. However, while camping near Nicea, the remnants of the German army, including a dazed and sick King Conrad, staggered past the French camp, bringing news of their disaster. The French, with what remained of the Germans, then began to march in increasingly disorganized fashion towards Antioch. They were in high spirits on Christmas Eve, when they chose to camp in a lush valley near [[Ephesus]]. Here they were ambushed by a Turkish detachment, but the French proceeded to slaughter this detachment and appropriate their camp.\n\nLouis then decided to cross the Phrygian mountains directly in the hope of reaching Eleanor's [[Raymond of Poitiers|uncle Raymond]] in Antioch more quickly. As they ascended the mountains, however, the army and the king and queen were horrified to discover the unburied corpses of the previously German army slaughtered there.\n\nOn the day set for the crossing of Mount Cadmus, Louis chose to take charge of the rear of the column, where the unarmed pilgrims and the baggage trains marched. The vanguard, with which Queen Eleanor marched, was commanded by her Aquitainian vassal, [[Geoffrey de Rancon]]. Unencumbered by baggage, they reached the summit of Cadmus, where Rancon had been ordered to make camp for the night. Rancon, however, chose to continue on, deciding in concert with [[Amadeus III, Count of Savoy]], Louis's uncle, that a nearby plateau would make a better campsite. Such disobedience was reportedly common.\n\n{{main|Battle of Mount Cadmus}}\nAccordingly, by mid-afternoon, the rear of the column&nbsp;\u2014believing the day's march to be nearly at an end&nbsp;\u2014was dawdling. This resulted in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. At this point the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler [[William of Tyre]], writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.\n\nThe king, having scorned royal apparel in favour of a simple pilgrim's tunic, escaped notice, unlike his bodyguards, whose skulls were brutally smashed and limbs severed. He reportedly \"nimbly and bravely scaled a rock by making use of some tree roots which God had provided for his safety\" and managed to survive the attack. Others were not so fortunate: \"No aid came from Heaven, except that night fell.\"{{sfnp|Meade|1977|p=100}}\n\nOfficial blame for the disaster was placed on Geoffrey de Rancon, who had made the decision to continue, and it was suggested that he be hanged, a suggestion which the king ignored. Since Geoffrey was Eleanor's vassal, many believed that it was she who had been ultimately responsible for the change in plan, and thus the massacre. This suspicion of responsibility did nothing for her popularity in [[Christendom]]. She was also blamed for the size of the baggage train and the fact that her Aquitainian soldiers had marched at the front and thus were not involved in the fight. Continuing on, the army became split, with the commoners marching toward Antioch and the royalty traveling by sea. When most of the land army arrived, the king and queen had a dispute. Some, such as [[John of Salisbury]] and William of Tyre, say Eleanor's reputation was sullied by rumours of an affair with her uncle Raymond. However, this rumor may have been a ruse, as Raymond, through Eleanor, had been trying to induce Louis to use his army to attack the actual Muslim encampment at nearby [[Aleppo]], gateway to retaking [[Edessa]], which had all along, by papal decree, been the main objective of the Crusade. Although this was perhaps the better military plan, Louis was not keen to fight in northern Syria. One of Louis's avowed Crusade goals was to journey in pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], and he stated his intention to continue. Reputedly Eleanor then requested to stay with Raymond and brought up the matter of consanguinity&nbsp;\u2014the fact that she and her husband, King Louis, were perhaps too closely related. Consanguinity was grounds for annulment in the medieval period. But rather than allowing her to stay, Louis took Eleanor from Antioch against her will and continued on to Jerusalem with his dwindling army.{{sfnp|Hodgson|2007|pp=131\u2013134}}\n\nLouis's refusal and his forcing her to accompany him humiliated Eleanor, and she maintained a low profile for the rest of the crusade. Louis's subsequent assault on [[Damascus]] in 1148 with his remaining army, fortified by King Conrad and [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], achieved little. Damascus was a major wealthy trading centre and was under normal circumstances a potential threat, but the rulers of Jerusalem had recently entered into a truce with the city, which they then forswore. It was a gamble that did not pay off, and whether through military error or betrayal, the Damascus campaign was a failure. Louis's long march to Jerusalem and back north, which Eleanor was forced to join, debilitated his army and disheartened her knights; the divided Crusade armies could not overcome the Muslim forces, and the royal couple had to return home. The French royal family retreated to Jerusalem and then sailed to Rome and made their way back to Paris.\n\nWhile in the eastern Mediterranean, Eleanor learned about maritime conventions developing there, which were the beginnings of what would become [[admiralty law]]. She introduced those conventions in her own lands on the island of [[Oleron]] in 1160 (with the \"[[Rolls of Ol\u00e9ron]]\") and later in England as well. She was also instrumental in developing trade agreements with Constantinople and ports of trade in the Holy Lands.\n\n===Annulment===\nEven before the Crusade, Eleanor and Louis were becoming estranged, and their differences were only exacerbated while they were abroad.  Eleanor's purported relationship with her uncle Raymond,{{sfnp|Crawford|2012}} the ruler of Antioch, was a major source of discord. Eleanor supported her uncle's desire to re-capture the nearby [[County of Edessa]], the objective of the Crusade. In addition, having been close to him in their youth, she now showed what was considered to be \"excessive affection\" toward her uncle. Raymond had plans to abduct Eleanor, to which she consented.{{sfnp|Chambers|1941}} While many historians{{who|date=August 2011}} today dismiss this as normal affection between uncle and niece, noting their early friendship and his similarity to her father and grandfather, some of Eleanor's adversaries interpreted the generous displays of affection as an incestuous affair.\n\nHome, however, was not easily reached. Louis and Eleanor, on separate ships due to their disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanor's ship far to the south to the [[Barbary Coast]] and caused her to lose track of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanor's ship finally reached [[Palermo]] in Sicily, where she discovered that she and her husband had both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King [[Roger II of Sicily]], until the king eventually reached [[Calabria]], and she set out to meet him there. Later, at King Roger's court in [[Potenza]], she learned of the death of her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from [[Marseilles]], they went to see Pope Eugene III in [[Tusculum]], where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the [[Commune of Rome]].\n\nEugene did not, as Eleanor had hoped, grant an annulment. Instead, he attempted to reconcile Eleanor and Louis, confirming the legality of their marriage. He proclaimed that no word could be spoken against it, and that it might not be dissolved under any pretext. Eventually, he arranged events so that Eleanor had no choice{{clarify|date=February 2015}} but to sleep with Louis in a bed specially prepared{{how|date=February 2015}} by the Pope.<ref>''Historia Pontificalis'' of [[John of Salisbury]]</ref> Thus was conceived their second child&nbsp;\u2014not a son, but another daughter, [[Alix of France, Countess of Blois|Alix of France]].\n\nThe marriage was now doomed. Still without a son and in danger of being left with no male heir, facing substantial opposition to Eleanor from many of his barons and her own desire for annulment, Louis bowed to the inevitable. On 11 March 1152, they met at the royal castle of [[Beaugency]] to dissolve the marriage. Hugues de Toucy, [[archbishop of Sens]], presided, and Louis and Eleanor were both present, as were the archbishop of Bordeaux and Rouen. Archbishop [[Samson of Reims]] acted for Eleanor.\n\nOn 21 March, the four archbishops, with the approval of Pope Eugene, granted an annulment on grounds of [[consanguinity]] within the fourth degree; Eleanor was Louis' third cousin once removed, and shared common ancestry with [[Robert II of France]]. Their two daughters were, however, declared legitimate. Children born to a marriage that was later annulled were not at risk of being \"bastardized,\" because \"[w]here parties married in good faith, without knowledge of an impediment,&nbsp;... children of the marriage were legitimate.\"  [Berman 228.] {{why|date=February 2015}}) Custody of them was awarded to King Louis. Archbishop Samson received assurances from Louis that Eleanor's lands would be restored to her.\n\n==Second marriage==\n[[File:Henry II of England.jpg|thumb|right|Henry II of England]]\n[[File:France 12thC.jpg|thumb|right|The marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine to Henry of Anjou and Henry's subsequent succession to the throne of England created the [[Angevin empire]].]]\nAs Eleanor traveled to Poitiers, two lords&nbsp;\u2014[[Theobald V, Count of Blois]], and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes]], brother of [[Henry II of England|Henry II, Duke of Normandy]]&nbsp;\u2014tried to kidnap and marry her to claim her lands. As soon as she arrived in Poitiers, Eleanor sent envoys to Henry, duke of Normandy and future king of England, asking him to come at once to marry her. On 18 May 1152 ([[Whit Sunday]]), eight weeks after her annulment, Eleanor married Henry \"without the pomp and ceremony that befitted their rank.\"<ref>''Chronique de Touraine''{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEleanor was related to Henry even more closely than she had been to Louis: they were cousins to the third degree through their common ancestor Ermengarde of Anjou, wife of [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy]] and Geoffrey, Count of G\u00e2tinais, and they were also descended from King [[Robert the Pious|Robert II of France]]. A marriage between Henry and Eleanor's daughter Marie had earlier been declared impossible due to their status as third cousins once removed. It was rumored by some that Eleanor had had an affair with Henry's own father, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou]], who had advised his son to avoid any involvement with her.\n\nOn 25 October 1154, Henry became [[king of England]]. Eleanor was [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] [[List of English consorts|queen of England]] by the [[archbishop of Canterbury]] on 19 December 1154.{{sfnp|Wheeler|Parsons|2008}} She may not have been [[anointment|anointed]] on this occasion, however, because she had already been anointed in 1137.{{sfnp||Aurell|2007}} Over the next 13 years, she bore Henry five sons and three daughters: [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[John, King of England|John]], [[Matilda, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Leonora of Aquitaine|Eleanor]], and [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Sicily|Joan]]. John Speed, in his 1611 work ''History of Great Britain'', mentions the possibility that Eleanor had a son named Philip, who died young. His sources no longer exist, and he alone mentions this birth.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nEleanor's marriage to Henry was reputed to be tumultuous and argumentative, although sufficiently cooperative to produce at least eight pregnancies. Henry was by no means faithful to his wife and had a reputation for philandering. Henry fathered other, illegitimate children throughout the marriage. Eleanor appears to have taken an ambivalent attitude towards these affairs. [[Geoffrey (Archbishop of York)|Geoffrey of York]], for example, was an illegitimate son of Henry, but acknowledged by Henry as his child and raised at [[Westminster]] in the care of the queen.\n\nDuring the period from Henry's accession to the birth of Eleanor's youngest son John, affairs in the kingdom were turbulent: Aquitaine, as was the norm, defied the authority of Henry as Eleanor's husband and answered only to their duchess. Attempts were made to claim [[Toulouse]], the rightful inheritance of Eleanor's grandmother [[Philippa of Toulouse]], but they ended in failure. A bitter feud arose between the king and [[Thomas Becket]], initially his chancellor and closest adviser and later the archbishop of Canterbury. Louis of France had remarried and been widowed; he married for the third time and finally fathered a long-hoped-for son, Philip Augustus, also known as Dieudonne\u2014God-given). \"Young Henry,\" son of Henry and Eleanor, wed [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Marguerite of France]], daughter of Louis from his second marriage. Little is known of Eleanor's involvement in these events. It is certain that by late 1166, Henry's notorious affair with [[Rosamund Clifford]] had become known, and Eleanor's marriage to Henry appears to have become terminally strained.\n\nIn 1167, Eleanor's third daughter, Matilda, married [[Henry the Lion]] of Saxony. Eleanor remained in England with her daughter for the year prior to Matilda's departure for Normandy in September. In December, Eleanor gathered her movable possessions in England and transported them on several ships to [[Argentan]]. Christmas was celebrated at the royal court there, and she appears to have agreed to a separation from Henry. She certainly left for her own city of Poitiers immediately after Christmas. Henry did not stop her; on the contrary, he and his army personally escorted her there before attacking a castle belonging to the rebellious [[Lusignan]] family. Henry then went about his own business outside Aquitaine, leaving Earl Patrick, his regional military commander, as her protective custodian. When Patrick was killed in a skirmish, Eleanor, who proceeded to ransom his captured nephew, the young [[William Marshal]], was left in control of her lands.\n\n===The Court of Love in Poitiers===\n[[File:Poitiers - Palais de Justice 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Poitiers]], seat of the counts of Poitou and dukes of Aquitaine in the 10th through 12th centuries, where Eleanor's highly literate and artistic court inspired tales of Courts of Love.]]\n\nOf all her influence on culture, Eleanor's time in Poitiers between 1168 and 1173 was perhaps the most critical, yet very little is known about it. Henry II was elsewhere, attending to his own affairs after escorting Eleanor there.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Some believe that Eleanor's court in Poitiers was the \"Court of Love\" where Eleanor and her daughter Marie meshed and encouraged the ideas of [[troubadour]]s, [[chivalry]], and [[courtly love]] into a single court. It may have been largely to teach manners, something the French courts would be known for in later generations. Yet the existence and reasons for this court are debated.\n\nIn ''The Art of Courtly Love'', [[Andreas Capellanus]], Andrew the chaplain, refers to the court of Poitiers. He claims that Eleanor, her daughter Marie, [[Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne]], and [[Elisabeth, Countess of Vermandois|Isabelle of Flanders]] would sit and listen to the quarrels of lovers and act as a jury to the questions of the court that revolved around acts of romantic love. He records some twenty-one cases, the most famous of them being a problem posed to the women about whether true love can exist in marriage. According to Capellanus, the women decided that it was not at all likely.{{sfnp|Black|2009|p=389}}\n\nSome scholars believe that the \"court of love\" probably never existed since the only evidence for it is Andreas Capellanus' book. To strengthen their argument, they state that there is no other evidence that Marie ever stayed with her mother in Poitiers.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Andreas wrote for the court of the king of France, where Eleanor was not held in esteem. Polly Schoyer Brooks, the author of a non-academic biography of Eleanor, suggests that the court did exist, but that it was not taken very seriously, and that acts of courtly love were just a \"parlor game\" made up by Eleanor and Marie in order to place some order over the young courtiers living there.<ref>{{harvp|Brooks|1983}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere is no claim that Eleanor invented courtly love, since it was a concept that had begun to grow before Eleanor's court arose.  All that can be said is that her court at Poitiers was most likely a catalyst for the increased popularity of courtly love literature in the Western European regions.{{sfnp|Kelly|1937|pp=3\u201319}} Amy Kelly, in her article, \"Eleanor of Aquitaine and Her Courts of Love,\" gives a very plausible description of the origins of the rules of Eleanor's court: \"In the Poitevin code, man is the property, the very thing of woman; whereas a precisely contrary state of things existed in the adjacent realms of the two kings from whom the reigning duchess of Aquitaine was estranged.\"{{sfnp|Kelly|1937|p=12}}\n\n===Revolt and capture===\nIn March 1173, aggrieved at his lack of power and egged on by Henry's enemies, his son by the same name, the younger Henry, launched the [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174]]. He fled to Paris. From there, \"the younger Henry, devising evil against his father from every side by the advice of the French king, went secretly into [[Aquitaine]] where his two youthful brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, were living with their mother, and with her connivance, so it is said, he incited them to join him.\"<ref>William of Newburgh, Book II, Chapter 7{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref>  One source claimed that the queen sent her younger sons to France \"to join with him against their father the king.\"<ref name = \"fqsuxq\">Roger of Hoveden{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> Once her sons had left for Paris, Eleanor may have encouraged the lords of the south to rise up and support them.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}}\n\nSometime between the end of March and the beginning of May, Eleanor left Poitiers, but was arrested and sent to the king at [[Rouen]]. The king did not announce the arrest publicly; for the next year, the queen's whereabouts were unknown. On 8 July 1174, Henry and Eleanor took ship for England from [[Barfleur]]. As soon as they disembarked at [[Southampton]], Eleanor was taken either to [[Winchester Castle]] or [[Old Sarum|Sarum Castle]] and held there.\n\n===Years of imprisonment 1173\u20131189===\n[[File:EleanorAkvitanie1068.jpg|thumb|right|The obverse of Eleanor's seal. She is identified as ''Eleanor, by the Grace of God, Queen of the English, Duchess of the Normans''. The legend on the reverse calls her ''Eleanor, Duchess of the Aquitanians and Countess of the Angevins''.{{sfnp|Wheeler|Parsons|2008}}]]\n\nEleanor was imprisoned for the next 16 years, much of the time in various locations in England. During her imprisonment, Eleanor became more and more distant from her sons, especially from Richard, who had always been her favorite. She did not have the opportunity to see her sons very often during her imprisonment, though she was released for special occasions such as Christmas. About four miles from [[Shrewsbury]] and close by [[Haughmond Abbey]] is \"Queen Eleanor's Bower,\" the remains of a triangular castle which is believed to have been one of her prisons.\n\nHenry lost the woman reputed to be his great love, [[Rosamund Clifford]], in 1176. He had met her in 1166 and had begun their liaison in 1173, supposedly contemplating divorce from Eleanor. This notorious affair caused a monkish scribe to transcribe Rosamund's name in Latin to \"Rosa Immundi,\" or \"Rose of Unchastity.\" The king had many mistresses, but although he treated earlier liaisons discreetly, he flaunted Rosamund. He may have done so to provoke Eleanor into seeking an annulment, but if so, the queen disappointed him. Nevertheless, rumours persisted, perhaps assisted by Henry's camp, that Eleanor had poisoned Rosamund. It is also speculated that Eleanor placed Rosamund in a bathtub and had an old woman cut Rosamund's arms.{{sfnp|Chambers|1941}} Henry donated much money to [[Godstow Nunnery]], where Rosamund was buried.\n\nIn 1183, the young King Henry tried again to force his father to hand over some of his patrimony. In debt and refused control of Normandy, he tried to ambush his father at [[Limoges]]. He was joined by troops sent by his brother Geoffrey and [[Philip II of France]]. Henry II's troops besieged the town, forcing his son to flee. After wandering aimlessly through Aquitaine, Henry the Younger caught [[dysentery]]. On Saturday, 11 June 1183, the young king realized he was dying and was overcome with remorse for his sins. When his father's ring was sent to him, he begged that his father would show mercy to his mother, and that all his companions would plead with Henry to set her free. Henry II sent Thomas of Earley, [[Archdeacon of Wells]], to break the news to Eleanor at Sarum.{{efn|Ms. S. Berry, senior archivist at the Somerset Archive and Record Service, identified this \"archdeacon of Wells\" as Thomas of Earley, noting his family ties to Henry II and the Earleys' philanthropies.{{sfnp|Fripp|2006|loc=ch. 33, and endnote 40.}} }} Eleanor reputedly had had a dream in which she foresaw her son Henry's death. In 1193, she would tell [[Pope Celestine III]] that she was tortured by his memory.\n\nKing Philip II of France claimed that certain properties in Normandy belonged to his half-sister Margaret, widow of the young Henry, but Henry insisted that they had once belonged to Eleanor and would revert to her upon her son's death. For this reason Henry summoned Eleanor to Normandy in the late summer of 1183. She stayed in Normandy for six months. This was the beginning of a period of greater freedom for the still-supervised Eleanor. Eleanor went back to England probably early in 1184.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Over the next few years Eleanor often travelled with her husband and was sometimes associated with him in the government of the realm, but still had a custodian so that she was not free.\n\n==Widowhood==\nUpon the death of her husband Henry II on 6 July 1189, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] was the undisputed heir. One of his first acts as king was to send [[William Marshal]] to England with orders to release Eleanor from prison; he found upon his arrival that her custodians had already released her.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Eleanor rode to Westminster and received the oaths of fealty from many lords and prelates on behalf of the king. She ruled England in Richard's name, signing herself \"Eleanor, by the grace of God, Queen of England.\" On 13{{nbsp}}August 1189, Richard sailed from Barfleur to [[Portsmouth]] and was received with enthusiasm. Between 1190 and 1194, Richard was absent from England, engaged in the Third Crusade from 1190 to 1192 and then held in captivity by Henry{{nbsp}}VI, Holy Roman Emperor. During Richard's absence, royal authority in England was represented by a Council of Regency in conjunction with a succession of chief justiciars{{snd}}William de Longchamp (1190\u20131191), Walter de{{nbsp}}Coutances (1191\u20131193), and finally Hubert Walter. Although Eleanor held no formal office in England during this period, she arrived in England in the company of Coutances in June 1191, and for the remainder of Richard's absence, she exercised a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of England as well as the conduct of Prince John. Eleanor played a key role in raising the ransom demanded from England by Henry{{nbsp}}VI and in the negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor that eventually secured Richard's release.\n\nEleanor survived Richard and lived well into the reign of her youngest son, [[John, King of England|King John]]. In 1199, under the terms of a truce between King Philip{{nbsp}}II and King John, it was agreed that Philip's 12-year-old heir-apparent [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]] would be married to one of John's nieces, daughters of his sister Eleanor of England, queen of Castile. John instructed his mother to travel to Castile to select one of the princesses. Now 77, Eleanor set out from Poitiers. Just outside Poitiers she was ambushed and held captive by [[Hugh IX of Lusignan]], whose lands had been sold to Henry{{nbsp}}II by his forebears. Eleanor secured her freedom by agreeing to his demands. She continued south, crossed the Pyrenees, and travelled through the kingdoms of Navarre and Castile, arriving in Castile before the end of January 1200.\n\nKing [[Alfonso VIII]] and Eleanor's daughter, Queen Eleanor of Castile, had two remaining unmarried daughters, [[Urraca of Castile, Queen of Portugal|Urraca]] and [[Blanche of Castile|Blanche]]. Eleanor selected the younger daughter, Blanche. She stayed for two months at the Castilian court, then late in March journeyed with granddaughter Blanche back across the Pyrenees. She celebrated Easter in Bordeaux, where the famous warrior [[Mercadier]] came to her court. It was decided that he would escort the queen and princess north. \"On the second day in Easter week, he was slain in the city by a man-at-arms in the service of Brandin,\"<ref name = \"fqsuxq\"/> a rival mercenary captain. This tragedy was too much for the elderly queen, who was fatigued and unable to continue to Normandy. She and Blanche rode in easy stages to the valley of the Loire, and she entrusted Blanche to the archbishop of Bordeaux, who took over as her escort. The exhausted Eleanor went to [[Fontevraud]], where she remained. In early summer, Eleanor was ill, and John visited her at Fontevraud.\n\n[[File:Gisant alienor d aquitaine et henri2.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb effigies of Eleanor and Henry{{nbsp}}II at [[Fontevraud Abbey]]]]\nEleanor was again unwell in early 1201. When war broke out between John and Philip, Eleanor declared her support for John and set out from Fontevraud to her capital Poitiers to prevent her grandson [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany]], posthumous son of Eleanor's son Geoffrey and John's rival for the English throne, from taking control. Arthur learned of her whereabouts and besieged her in the castle of [[Mirebeau]]. As soon as John heard of this, he marched south, overcame the besiegers, and captured the 15-year-old Arthur. Eleanor then returned to Fontevraud where she took the veil as a nun.\n\nEleanor died in 1204 and was entombed in [[Fontevraud Abbey]] next to her husband Henry and her son Richard. Her tomb [[effigy]] shows her reading a Bible and is decorated with magnificent jewelry. By the time of her death she had outlived all of her children except for King John of England and Queen Eleanor of Castile.\n\n==Appearance==\nContemporary sources praise Eleanor's beauty.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}} Even in an era when ladies of the nobility were excessively praised, their praise of her was undoubtedly sincere. When she was young, she was described as ''perpulchra''{{snd}}more than beautiful. When she was around 30, [[Bernard de Ventadour]], a noted troubadour, called her \"gracious, lovely, the embodiment of charm,\" extolling her \"lovely eyes and noble countenance\" and declaring that she was \"one meet to crown the state of any king.\"{{sfnp|Weir|2008}}{{sfnp|Elvins|2006}} [[William of Newburgh]] emphasized the charms of her person, and even in her old age [[Richard of Devizes]] described her as beautiful, while [[Matthew Paris]], writing in the 13th{{nbsp}}century, recalled her \"admirable beauty.\"\n\nIn spite of all these words of praise, no one left a more detailed description of Eleanor; the colour of her hair and eyes, for example, are unknown. The effigy on her tomb shows a tall and large-boned woman with brown skin, though this may not be an accurate representation. Her seal of {{Circa}}1152 shows a woman with a slender figure, but this is likely an impersonal image.{{sfnp|Weir|1999|p=}}\n\n==Popular culture==\n\n===Art===\nJudy Chicago's artistic installation ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' features a place setting for Eleanor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings |title=Place Settings |website=Brooklyn Museum |access-date=2015-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Books and dramas===\nHenry and Eleanor are the main characters in [[James Goldman]]'s play ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'', which was [[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|made into a film]] in 1968 starring [[Peter O'Toole]] as Henry and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the role of Eleanor, for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress\u2014Motion Picture Drama]].\n\nThe character Queen Elinor appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', with other members of the family.

This is the earliest known fragment of the Epistle to Philemon.</div>}}\nThe '''Epistle of Paul to Philemon''', known simply as '''Philemon''', is one of the books of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]]. It is a [[Prison literature|prison letter]], co-authored by [[Paul the Apostle]] with [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], to [[Saint Philemon|Philemon]], a leader in the [[Colossae|Colossian]] church. It deals with the themes of [[forgiveness]] and [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]]. Paul does not identify himself as an apostle with authority, but as \"a prisoner for Jesus Christ\", calling Timothy \"our brother\", and addressing Philemon as \"fellow labourer\" and \"brother.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Philemon|1:1; 1:7; 1:20|9}}</ref> [[Onesimus]], a slave that had departed from his master Philemon, was returning with this epistle wherein Paul asked Philemon to receive him as a \"brother beloved.\"<ref>verse 1:16 in {{bibleref2|Philemon|1:9\u201317|9|Philemon 1:9\u201317}}</ref>\n\nPhilemon was a wealthy Christian, possibly a bishop<ref>[[Apostolic constitution|Const.

This letter is now generally regarded as one of the [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles#undisputed|undisputed works of Paul]]. It is the shortest of Paul's extant letters, consisting of only 335 words in the Greek text.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patzia|first1=A. G.|editor1-last=Hawthorne|editor1-first=Gerald F. et. al.|title=Dictionary of Paul and His Letters|date=1994|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0851106519|page=703|chapter=Philemon, Letter To}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Authorship===\nThe epistle of Philemon is attributed to the apostle Paul, and this attribution has rarely been questioned by scholars.{{sfn|Bruce|1984|p=191}} Along with six others, it is numbered among the \"undisputed letters\", which are widely considered to be authentically Pauline. The main challenge to the letter's authenticity came from a group of German scholars in the nineteenth century known as the [[T\u00fcbingen School]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=270}} Their leader, [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]], only accepted four New Testament epistles as genuinely written by Paul: [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[1 Corinthians|1]] and [[2 Corinthians]] and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]. Commenting on Philemon, Baur described the subject matter as \"so very singular as to arouse our suspicions,\"{{sfn|Baur|1875|p=81}} and concluded that it is perhaps a \"Christian romance serving to convey a genuine Christian idea.\"{{sfn|Baur|1875|p=84}}\n\nThe opening verse of the salutation also names [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] alongside Paul. This, however, does not mean that Timothy was the epistle's co-author. Rather, Paul regularly mentions others in the address if they have a particular connection with the recipient. In this case, Timothy may have encountered Philemon while accompanying Paul in his work in Ephesus.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=272}}\n\n===Occasion===\nAccording to the majority interpretation, Paul wrote this letter on behalf of Onesimus, a runaway slave who had wronged his owner Philemon. The details of the offence are unstated, although it is often assumed that Onesimus had fled after stealing money, as Paul states in verse 18 that if Onesimus owes anything, Philemon should charge this to Paul's account.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Sometime after leaving, Onesimus came into contact with Paul, although again the details are unclear. He may have been arrested and imprisoned alongside Paul. Alternatively, he may have previously heard Paul's name (as his owner was a Christian) and so travelled to him for help.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} After meeting Paul, Onesimus became a Christian believer. An affection grew between them, and Paul would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him. However, he considered it better to send him back to Philemon with an accompanying letter, which aimed to effect reconciliation between them as Christian brothers. The preservation of the letter suggests that Paul's request was granted.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=268}}\n\nOnesimus' status as a runaway slave was challenged by Allen Dwight Callahan in an article published in the ''Harvard Theological Review'' and in a later commentary. Callahan argues that, beyond verse 16, \"nothing in the text conclusively indicates that Onesimus was ever the chattel of the letter's chief addressee. Moreover, the expectations fostered by the traditional fugitive slave hypothesis go unrealized in the letter. Modern commentators, even those committed to the prevailing interpretation, have tacitly admitted as much.\"{{sfn|Callahan|1993|p=362}} Callahan argues that the earliest commentators on this work \u2013 the homily of [[Origen]] and the Anti-Marcion Preface \u2013 are silent about Onesimus' possible servile status, and traces the origins of this interpretation to [[John Chrysostom]], who proposed it in his ''Homiliae in epistolam ad Philemonem'', during his ministry in [[Antioch]], circa 386\u2013398.{{sfn|Callahan|1993|p=366}} In place of the traditional interpretation, Callahan suggests that Onesimus and Philemon are brothers both by blood and religion, but who have become estranged, and the intent of this letter was to reconcile the two men.{{sfn|Callahan|1993|pp=369ff}} [[Ben Witherington III]] has challenged Callahan's interpretation as a misreading of Paul's rhetoric.{{sfn|Witherington|2007|pp=62\u201363}} Further, Margaret M. Mitchell has demonstrated that a number of writers before Chrysostom either argue or assume that Onesimus was a runaway slave, including [[Athanasius]], [[Basil of Caesarea]] and [[Ambrosiaster]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1995|pp=145\u201346}}\n\nThe only extant information about Onesimus apart from this letter is found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians 4:7\u20139, where Onesimus is called \"a faithful and beloved brother\":\n\n{{quote|All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, ''who is'' a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; <sup>9</sup> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is ''one'' of you. They shall make known unto you all things which ''are done'' here.}}\n\n===Recipient===\nThe letter is addressed to [[Philemon (New Testament person)|Philemon]], Apphia and Archippus, and the church in Philemon's house. Philemon is described as a \"fellow worker\" of Paul. It is generally assumed that he lived in Colossae; in the letter to the Colossians, Onesimus (the slave who fled from Philemon) and Archippus (whom Paul greets in the letter to Philemon) are described as members of the church there.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=266}} Philemon may have converted to Christianity through Paul's ministry, possibly in [[Ephesus]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|pp=266-67}} Apphia in the salutation is probably Philemon's wife.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Some have speculated that Archippus, described by Paul as a \"fellow soldier\", is the son of Philemon and Apphia.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}}\n\nThe American John Knox proposed that Onesimus' owner was in fact Archippus, and the letter was addressed to him rather than Philemon. In this reconstruction, Philemon would receive the letter first and then encourage Archippus to release Onesimus so that he could work alongside Paul. This view, however, has not found widespread support.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} In particular, Knox's view has been challenged on the basis of the opening verses. According to O'Brien, the fact that Philemon's name is mentioned first, together with the use of the phrase \"in your house\" in verse 2, makes it unlikely that Archippus was the primary addressee.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Knox further argued that the letter was intended to be read aloud in the Colossian church in order to put pressure on Archippus. A number of commentators, however, see this view as contradicting the tone of the letter.{{sfn|Bruce|1984|pp=404\u201305}}{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=268}} [[J. B. Lightfoot]], for example, wrote: \"The tact and delicacy of the Apostle's pleading for Onesimus would be nullified at one stroke by the demand for publication.\"{{sfn|Lightfoot|1879|p=281}}\n\n==Content==\n\n===Greeting and introduction (1\u20133)===\nThe opening salutation follows a typical pattern found in other Pauline letters. Paul first introduces himself, with a self-designation as a \"prisoner of Jesus Christ,\" which in this case refers to a physical imprisonment. He also mentions his associate Timothy, as a valued colleague who was presumably known to the recipient. As well as addressing the letter to Philemon, Paul sends greetings to Apphia, Archippus and the church that meets in Philemon's house. Apphia is often presumed to be Philemon's wife and Archippus, a \"fellow labourer\", is sometimes suggested to be their son. Paul concludes his salutation with a prayerful wish for grace and peace.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=274}}\n\n===Thanksgiving and intercession (4\u20137)===\nBefore addressing the main topic of the letter, Paul continues with a paragraph of thanksgiving and intercession. This serves to prepare the ground for Paul's central request. He gives thanks to God for Philemon's love and faith and prays for his faith to be effective. He concludes this paragraph by describing the joy and comfort he has received from knowing how Philemon has shown love towards the Christians in Colossae.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=283}}\n\n===Paul's plea for Onesimus (8\u201320)===\nAs a background to his specific plea for Onesimus, Paul clarifies his intentions and circumstances. Although he has the boldness to command Philemon to do what would be right in the circumstances, he prefers to base his appeal on his knowledge of Philemon's love and generosity. He also describes the affection he has for Onesimus and the transformation that has taken place with Onesimus's conversion to the Christian faith. Where Onesimus was \"useless\", now he is \"useful\" \u2013 a wordplay, as Onesimus means \"useful\". Paul indicates that he would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him, but recognised that it was right to send him back. Paul's specific request is for Philemon to welcome Onesimus as he would welcome Paul, namely as a Christian brother. He offers to pay for any debt created by Onesimus' departure and expresses his desire that Philemon might refresh his heart in Christ.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=303}}\n\n===Conclusion and greetings (21\u201325)===\nIn the final section of the letter, Paul describes his confidence that Philemon would do even more than he had requested, perhaps indicating his desire for Onesimus to return to work alongside him. He also mentions his wish to visit and asks Philemon to prepare a guest room. Paul sends greetings from five of his co-workers and concludes the letter with a [[benediction]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=309}}\n\n==Themes==\nPaul uses slavery vs. freedom language more often in his writings as a metaphor.<ref>Foster, Paul. \"Philippians And Philemon: Sacra Pagina Commentary.\" p.174</ref> At this time slavery was common, and can be seen as a theme in the book of Philemon. Slavery was most commonly found in households. This letter, seemingly, provided alleviation of suffering of some slaves due to the fact that Paul placed pastoral focus on the issue.<ref>Foster, Paul. \"Philippians And Philemon: Sacra Pagina Commentary.\" p.176</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a main theme, Paul does not label slavery as negative or positive. Some scholars see it as unthinkable in the times to even question ending slavery. Because slavery was so ingrained into society that the \u201cabolitionist would have been at the same time an insurrectionist, and the political effects of such a movement would have been unthinkable.<ref name=\"Gaventa, Beverly Roberts 2010. p.894\">[[Beverly Roberts Gaventa|Gaventa, Beverly Roberts]], and David L. Petersen. The New Interpreter's Bible: One-Volume Commentary. Nashville: Abingdon, 2010. p.894</ref> Paul doesn\u2019t question it in this epistle. Paul may have envisioned slavery as a fixed institution. He was not questioning the \u201crightness or wrongness\u201d of it. Paul did however view slavery as a human institution, and believed that all human institutions were about to fade away.<ref name=\"Gaventa, Beverly Roberts 2010. p.894\"/> This may be because Paul had the perspective that Jesus would return soon. Paul viewed his present world as something that was swiftly passing away.<ref name=\"auto\"/> This is a part of [[Pauline Christianity]] and theology.\n\nWhen it comes to Onesimus and his circumstance as a slave, Paul felt that Onesimus should return to Philemon but not as a slave, but under a bond of familial love. Paul also was not suggesting that Onesimus be punished, but Roman law allowed the owner of a runaway slave nearly unlimited privileges of punishment, even execution.<ref name=\"auto\">Gaventa, Beverly Roberts, and David L. Petersen. The New Interpreter's Bible: One-Volume Commentary. Nashville: Abingdon, 2010. p.895</ref> This is a concern of Paul and a reason he is writing to Philemon, asking that Philemon accept Onesimus back in a bond of friendship, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Paul is trying to break through the social barriers dividing people.<ref name=\"auto\"/> We see this in many of Paul\u2019s other epistles, including his letters to the Corinthians, delivering the message of unity with others and unity with Christ \u2013 a change of identity. As written in Sacra Pagina Philippians and Philemon, the move from slave to freedman has to do with a shift in \u201cstanding under the lordship of Jesus Christ\u201d. So in short, Onesimus\u2019 honor and obedience is not claimed by Philemon, but by Christ.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nVerses 13\u201314 suggest that Paul wants Philemon to send Onesimus back to Paul (possibly freeing him for the purpose). Marshall, Travis and Paul write, \"Paul hoped that it might be possible for [Onesimus] to spend some time with him as a missionary colleague.... If that is not a request for Onesimus to join Paul\u2019s circle, I do not know what more would need to be said\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=I.

According to the [[Epistle to Diognetus]]: ''For the Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they observe... They are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. They pass their days on earth, but they are citizens of heaven. They obey the prescribed laws, and at the same time surpass the laws by their lives''.<ref>[http://biblehub.com/library/mathetes/the_epistle_of_mathetes_to_diognetus/chapter_v_the_manners_of_the.htm .

In fact Christianity was decisive to the virtual disappearance of slavery during the Middle Ages:\n\n{{quote|''Those who, as far as their civil status is concerned, stand in relation to one an other as masters and slaves, inasmuch as they are members of the one Church have become brothers and sisters\u2014this is how Christians addressed one another... Even if external structures remained unaltered, this changed society from within. When the Letter to the Hebrews says that Christians here on earth do not have a permanent homeland, but seek one which lies in the future (cf. Heb 11:13\u201316; Phil 3:20), this does not mean for one moment that they live only for the future: present society is recognized by Christians as an exile; they belong to a new society which is the goal of their common pilgrimage and which is anticipated in the course of that pilgrimage''.<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/es/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi.html Encyclical letter, Spe, Salvy of the Supreme Pontif Benedict XVI to the bishops priests and Deacons Men and Women Religious and all the Lay Faithful on Christian Hopes, Joseph Raztinger, Enciclical, City of Vatican, 2006]</ref>}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Epistle to Philemon|Textual variants in the Epistle to Philemon]]\n* [[Christian views on slavery]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Baur|first=Ferdinand Christian|title=Paul: His Life and Works|url=https://archive.org/details/paulapostlejesu00baurgoog|year=1875|edition=2nd|translator=Rev.

Indirectly, they can be used for [[encryption]] by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme. They are also used in several [[integer factorization]] [[algorithm]]s based on elliptic curves that have applications in cryptography, such as [[Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization]].\n\n== Rationale ==\nPublic-key cryptography is based on the [[Intractability (complexity)#Intractability|intractability]] of certain mathematical [[Computational hardness assumption|problems]]. Early public-key systems are secure assuming that it is difficult to [[Integer factorization|factor]] a large integer composed of two or more large prime factors. For elliptic-curve-based protocols, it is assumed that finding the [[discrete logarithm]] of a random elliptic curve element with respect to a publicly known base point is infeasible: this is the \"elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem\" (ECDLP). The security of elliptic curve cryptography depends on the ability to compute a [[elliptic curve point multiplication|point multiplication]] and the inability to compute the multiplicand given the original and product points. The size of the elliptic curve determines the difficulty of the problem.\n\nThe primary benefit promised by elliptic curve cryptography is a smaller [[key size]], reducing storage and transmission requirements, i.e. that an elliptic curve group could provide the same [[level of security]] afforded by an [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]]-based system with a large modulus and correspondingly larger key: for example, a 256-bit elliptic curve public key should provide comparable security to a 3072-bit RSA public key.\n\nThe U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has endorsed elliptic curve cryptography in its [[NSA Suite B|Suite B]] set of recommended algorithms, specifically [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (ECDH) for key exchange and [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] (ECDSA) for digital signature.  The U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) allows their use for protecting information classified up to [[Classified information in the United States|top secret]] with 384-bit keys.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml |title=Fact Sheet NSA Suite B Cryptography |work=U.S. National Security Agency |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207005135/http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml |archivedate=2009-02-07}}</ref> However, in August 2015, the NSA announced that it plans to replace Suite B with a new cipher suite due to concerns about [[quantum computing]] attacks on ECC.<ref name=nsaquantum />\n\nWhile the RSA patent expired in 2000, there may be [[ECC patents|patents in force covering certain aspects of ECC technology]].

Elliptic curve cryptography algorithms entered wide use in 2004 to 2005.\n\n== Theory ==\nFor current cryptographic purposes, an ''elliptic curve'' is a [[plane curve]] over a [[finite field]] (rather than the real numbers) which consists of the points satisfying the equation\n\n: <math>y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, \\, </math>\n\nalong with a distinguished [[point at infinity]], denoted \u221e. (The coordinates here are to be chosen from a fixed [[finite field]] of [[Characteristic (algebra)#Case of fields|characteristic]] not equal to 2 or 3, or the curve equation will be somewhat more complicated.)\n\nThis set together with the [[Elliptic curve#The group law|group operation of elliptic curves]] is an [[Abelian group]], with the point at infinity as identity element. The structure of the group is inherited from the [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor group]] of the underlying [[algebraic variety]].\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{Div}^0 (E) \\to \\mathrm{Pic}^0 (E) \\simeq E, \\, </math>\n\n== Cryptographic schemes ==\nSeveral [[discrete logarithm]]-based protocols have been adapted to elliptic curves, replacing the group <math>(\\mathbb{Z}_{p})^\\times</math> with an elliptic curve:\n* The [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (ECDH) key agreement scheme is based on the [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]] scheme,\n* The Elliptic Curve [[Integrated Encryption Scheme]] (ECIES), also known as Elliptic Curve Augmented Encryption Scheme or simply the Elliptic Curve Encryption Scheme,\n* The [[Elliptic Curve DSA|Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] (ECDSA) is based on the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]],\n* The deformation scheme using Harrison's p-adic Manhattan metric,\n* The [[EdDSA|Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] (EdDSA) is based on [[Schnorr signature]] and uses [[twisted Edwards curve]]s,\n* The [[ECMQV]] key agreement scheme is based on the [[Menezes\u2013Qu\u2013Vanstone|MQV]] key agreement scheme,\n* The [[Implicit certificate|ECQV]] implicit certificate scheme.\n\nAt the RSA Conference 2005, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) announced [[NSA Suite B|Suite B]] which exclusively uses ECC for digital signature generation and key exchange. The suite is intended to protect both classified and unclassified national security systems and information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/business/programs/elliptic_curve.shtml |title=The Case for Elliptic Curve Cryptography |work=NSA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117023500/http://www.nsa.gov/business/programs/elliptic_curve.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\nRecently, a large number of cryptographic primitives based on bilinear mappings on various elliptic curve groups, such as the [[Weil pairing|Weil]] and [[Tate pairing]]s, have been introduced. Schemes based on these primitives provide efficient [[identity-based encryption]] as well as pairing-based signatures, [[signcryption]], [[key agreement]], and [[proxy re-encryption]].\n\n== Implementation ==\nSome common implementation considerations include:\n\n=== Domain parameters ===\nTo use ECC, all parties must agree on all the elements defining the elliptic curve, that is, the ''domain parameters'' of the scheme. The field is defined by ''p'' in the prime case and the pair of ''m'' and ''f''<!--m and f are no longer defined before this in this article--> in the binary case. The elliptic curve is defined by the constants ''a'' and ''b'' used in its defining equation. Finally, the cyclic subgroup is defined by its ''generator'' (a.k.a. ''base point'') ''G''. For cryptographic application the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'', that is the smallest positive number ''n'' such that <math>n G = \\mathcal{O}</math> (the [[point at infinity]] of the curve, and the [[identity element]]), is normally prime. Since ''n'' is the size of a subgroup of <math>E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math> it follows from [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] that the number <math>h = \\frac{1}{n}|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|</math> is an integer. In cryptographic applications this number ''h'', called the ''cofactor'', must be small (<math>h \\le 4</math>) and, preferably, <math>h = 1</math>. To summarize: in the prime case, the domain parameters are <math>(p,a,b,G,n,h)</math>; in the binary case, they are <math>(m,f,a,b,G,n,h)</math>.\n\nUnless there is an assurance that domain parameters were generated by a party trusted with respect to their use, the domain parameters ''must'' be validated before use.<!--TBD: validation procedure-->\n\nThe generation of domain parameters is not usually done by each participant because this involves computing [[counting points on elliptic curves|the number of points on a curve]] which is time-consuming and troublesome to implement. As a result, several standard bodies published domain parameters of elliptic curves for several common field sizes. Such domain parameters are commonly known as \"standard curves\" or \"named curves\"; a named curve can be referenced either by name or by the unique [[object identifier]] defined in the standard documents:\n* [[NIST]], [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf Recommended Elliptic Curves for Government Use]\n* [[SECG]], [http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters]\n* ECC Brainpool (RFC 5639), [http://www.ecc-brainpool.org/download/Domain-parameters.pdf ECC Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation]\nSECG test vectors are also available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secg.org/download/aid-390/gec2.pdf |title=GEC 2: Test Vectors for SEC 1 |website=www.secg.org |format=PDF download |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606004254/http://www.secg.org/download/aid-390/gec2.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-06}}</ref> NIST has approved many SECG curves, so there is a significant overlap between the specifications published by NIST and SECG. EC domain parameters may be either specified by value or by name.\n\nIf one (despite the above) wants to construct one's own domain parameters, one should select the underlying field and then use one of the following strategies to find a curve with appropriate (i.e., near prime) number of points using one of the following methods:\n* Select a random curve and use a general point-counting algorithm, for example, [[Schoof's algorithm]] or [[Schoof\u2013Elkies\u2013Atkin algorithm]],\n* Select a random curve from a family which allows easy calculation of the number of points (e.g., [[Koblitz curve]]s), or\n* Select the number of points and generate a curve with this number of points using ''complex multiplication'' technique.<ref>{{Cite book |first=G. |last=Lay |first2=H. |last2=Zimmer |journal=Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium |year=1994 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=877 |issue= |pages=250\u2013263 |doi=10.1007/3-540-58691-1_64 |title=Constructing elliptic curves with given group order over large finite fields |isbn=978-3-540-58691-3 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral classes of curves are weak and should be avoided:\n* Curves over <math>\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}</math> with non-prime ''m'' are vulnerable to [[Weil descent]] attacks.<ref>{{cite book |first=S.

Inside the two biomes are plants that are collected from many diverse climates and environments. The project is located in a reclaimed [[china clay]] [[clay pit|pit]], located {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from the town of [[St Blazey]] and {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the larger town of [[St Austell]].<ref name=\"osexp1\">Ordnance Survey (2005). ''OS Explorer Map 107 \u2013 Fowey, Looe & Lostwithiel''. {{ISBN|0-319-23708-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant [[species]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/come-and-visit/whats-here/rainforest-biome/index.php | title = Rainforest Biome | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 11 October 2011 }}</ref> and each enclosure emulates a natural [[biome]]. The biomes consist of hundreds of [[hexagon]]al and [[pentagon]]al, inflated, plastic cells supported by steel frames. The largest of the two biomes simulates a [[rainforest]] environment and the second, a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean environment]]. The attraction also has an outside [[botanical garden]] which is home to many plants and wildlife native to Cornwall and the UK in general; it also has many plants that provide an important and interesting backstory, for example, those with a prehistoric heritage.\n\n== Design and construction ==\nThe project was conceived by [[Tim Smit]] and designed by architect [[Nicholas Grimshaw]] and engineering firm Anthony Hunt and Associates (now part of [[Sinclair Knight Merz]]). [[Davis Langdon]] carried out the project management, [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and [[Alfred McAlpine]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/our-history/index.php | title = Our history | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 27 September 2010 }}</ref> did the construction, [[Mero-Schmidlin|MERO]] designed and built the biomes, and [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] was the services engineer, economic consultant, environmental engineer and transportation engineer. [[Land use]] consultants led the masterplan and landscape design. The project took 2\u00bd years to construct and opened to the public on 17 March 2001.\n\n== Site ==\n\n[[File:Eden Project geodesic domes panorama.jpg|thumb|360px|Panoramic view of the geodesic biome domes at the Eden Project]]\n\n=== Layout ===\n[[File:The Bee (Eden Project).JPG|thumb|''The Bee'']]\nOnce into the attraction, there is a meandering path with views of the two biomes, planted landscapes, including vegetable gardens, and sculptures that include a giant [[bee]] and previously The [[WEEE]] Man (removed in 2016), a towering figure made from old electrical appliances and was meant to represent the average electrical waste used by one person in a lifetime.\n\n=== Biomes ===\nAt the bottom of the pit are two covered [[biome]]s:\n\nThe Tropical Biome, covers {{convert|1.56|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It is used for tropical plants, such as fruiting banana plants, [[Coffea|coffee]], rubber and giant [[bamboo]], and is kept at a tropical temperature and moisture level.\n[[File:The Tropical Biome.jpg|thumb|The Tropical Biome]]\n\nThe [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] Biome covers {{convert|0.654|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|135|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It houses familiar warm [[temperate]] and [[arid]] plants such as [[olive]]s and grape [[vine]]s and various sculptures.\n\nThe Outdoor Gardens represent the temperate regions of the world with plants such as tea, [[lavender]], [[hops]], [[hemp]] and [[sunflower]]s, as well as local plant species.\n\nThe covered biomes are constructed from a tubular steel (hex-tri-hex) with mostly hexagonal external cladding panels made from the thermoplastic [[ETFE]]. Glass was avoided due to its weight and potential dangers. The cladding panels themselves are created from several layers of thin [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-transparent ETFE [[Tensile structure|film]], which are sealed around their [[perimeter]] and inflated to create a large cushion. The resulting cushion acts as a thermal blanket to the structure. The ETFE material is resistant to most stains, which simply wash off in the rain. If required, cleaning can be performed by [[abseil]]ers. Although the ETFE is susceptible to punctures, these can be easily fixed with ETFE tape. The structure is completely self-supporting, with no internal supports, and takes the form of a [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] structure. The panels vary in size up to {{convert|9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} across, with the largest at the top of the structure.\n\nThe ETFE technology was supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]], which is also responsible for ongoing maintenance of the cladding. The steel spaceframe and cladding package (with Vector Foiltec as ETFE subcontractor) was designed, supplied and installed by MERO (UK) PLC, who also jointly developed the overall scheme geometry with the architect, Nicholas Grimshaw & Partners.\n\nThe entire build project was managed by McAlpine Joint Venture.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Eden Project Winter 2008 showing Bruce Munro field of Light.JPG|The Biomes and Link building showing [[Field of Light]] installation by [[Bruce Munro]]\nFile:Eden Project - tropical canopy.jpg|Inside the tropical Biome\nFile:The Eden Project, Cornwall.JPG|The Biomes (or eco domes) at The Eden Project in Cornwall.\nFile:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|The hexagonal structure looking from the inside\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Core ===\n[[File:The Core, Eden Project.JPG|thumb|The Core]]\nThe Core is the latest addition to the site and opened in September 2005. It provides the Eden Project with an education facility, incorporating classrooms and exhibition spaces designed to help communicate Eden's central message about the relationship between people and plants. Accordingly, the building has taken its inspiration from plants, most noticeable in the form of the soaring timber roof, which gives the building its distinctive shape.\n\nGrimshaw developed the geometry of the copper-clad roof in collaboration with a sculptor, Peter Randall-Page, and Mike Purvis of structural engineers [[Sinclair Knight Merz|SKM Anthony Hunts]]. It is derived from [[phyllotaxis]], which is the mathematical basis for nearly all plant growth; the \"opposing spirals\" found in many plants such as the seeds in a sunflower's head, [[pine cone]]s and [[pineapple]]s. The copper was obtained from traceable sources, and the Eden Project is working with [[Rio Tinto Group]] to explore the possibility of encouraging further traceable supply routes for metals, which would enable users to avoid metals mined unethically. The services and [[Acoustics|acoustic]], mechanical and electrical engineering design was carried out by [[Buro Happold]].\n\n==== Art at The Core ====\n[[File:The Seed at Eden Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=0.6|''Seed'' by Peter Randall-Page]]\nThe Core is also home to art exhibitions throughout the year. A permanent installation entitled ''Seed'', by [[Peter Randall-Page]], occupies the anteroom. ''Seed'' is a large, 70 tonne egg-shaped stone installation standing some {{convert|13|ft}} tall and displaying a complex pattern of protrusions that are based upon the [[Fibonacci number#In nature|geometric and mathematical principles that underlie plant growth]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Granite seed is 'planted' at Eden | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2007-06-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6738783.stm | access-date = 2018-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/visit/whats-here/seed-sculpture | title = Seed sculpture by Peter Randall-Page | publisher = Eden Project | access-date = 2018-02-25 | quote = Made out of a single piece of granite, its surface has been carved with 1,800 nodes in the pattern of a Fibonacci spiral \u2013 the growth pattern found across the natural world in things like sunflowers, pine cones and ammonites}}</ref>\n\n== Environmental aspects ==\n[[File:Cornwall, eden project tropical.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the tropical Biome]]\nThe domes provide diverse growing conditions, and many plants are on display.\n\nThe Eden Project includes [[environmental education]] focusing on the interdependence of plants and people; plants are labelled with their medicinal uses. The massive amounts of water required to create the humid conditions of the Tropical Biome, and to serve the toilet facilities, are all sanitised rain water that would otherwise collect at the bottom of the quarry. The only [[Public utility|mains]] water used is for hand washing and for cooking. The complex also uses Green Tariff Electricity \u2013 the energy comes from one of the many [[wind turbine]]s in Cornwall, which were among the first in Europe.\n\nControversially, one of the companies the Eden Project currently partners with is the British mining company Rio Tinto Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/media/mining-book-pr.php|title=New Eden Project book shows what can be done with disused mines|publisher=Eden project}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn December 2010 the Eden Project received permission to build a [[geothermal electricity]] plant which will generate approx 4MWe, enough to supply Eden and about 5000 households.<ref name=\"BBC Geotherm\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12026753|title=BBC News \u2013 Eden Project geothermal plant plans to go ahead |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 December 2010|date=18 December 2010}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Equus eden.jpg|thumb|Driftwood sculpture of a horse by Heather Jansch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heatherjansch.com/index.php|title=Heather Jansch Sculptor Bronze & Driftwood Horse|publisher=Heather Jansch}}</ref> from the main entrance]]\n[[File:Eden Project sculpture Made from the detritus of modern living - the teeth are computer mouses.JPG|thumb|Eden Project sculpture Made from the detritus of modern living\u2014the teeth are computer mice]]\n[[File:Grasswoman eden.jpg|thumb|''Eve'', by Sue and Pete Hill, shaped from the soil]]\n\nThe clay pit in which the project is sited was in use for over 160 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/about-us/our-story |title=Our Story |publisher=Eden Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712023922/http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/about-us/our-story |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 1981, the pit was used by the BBC as the planet surface of Magrathea in the 1981 TV series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/hitchhikers-guide-galaxy-douglas-adams | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jenny | last=Turner | title=Does the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy still answer the ultimate question? | date=3 October 2009}}</ref> By the mid-1990s the pit was all but exhausted.<ref name=\"edenproject.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/10th-birthday/10th-birthday-timeline|title=Eden story, educational charity \u2013 Eden Project, Cornwall|publisher=Eden Project}}</ref>\n\nThe initial idea for the project dates back to 1996, with construction beginning in 1998.

The first plants began arriving in September of that year,<ref name=\"edenproject.com\" /> and the full site opened on 17 March 2001.\n\nThe Eden Project was used as a filming location for the 2002 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Die Another Day]]''. On 2 July 2005 The Eden Project hosted the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|\"Africa Calling\" concert]] of the [[Live 8]] concert series.  It has also provided some plants for the [[British Museum]]'s Africa garden.\n\nIn 2005, the Project launched \"A Time of Gifts\" for the winter months, November to February.

The High Authority was the [[supranational]] administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg. In 1958, the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]] had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom). However their executives were called \"Commissions\" rather than \"High Authorities\".<ref name=\"ENA commission history\"/> The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].

It has put forward a large number of regulations based on a \"[[precautionary principle]]\". This means that pre-emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health: for example on tackling [[climate change]] and restricting [[genetically modified organisms]]. This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries. Owing to the size of the European market, this has made EU legislation an important influence in the global market.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Economist|date=20 September 2007|title=Brussels rules OK|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832900|accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nRecently the Commission has moved into creating [[Law of the European Union#Criminal law|European criminal law]].

However the more capable the candidate is, the more likely the Commission President will assign them a powerful portfolio, the distribution of which is entirely at his discretion. The President's team is then subject to hearings at the [[European Parliament]] which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole. If members of the team are found to be too inappropriate, the President must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole Commission being voted down. As Parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners there is usually a compromise whereby the worst candidates are removed but minor objections are put aside so the Commission can take office. Once the team is approved by parliament, it is formally put into office by the [[European Council]] ([[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|TEU Article 17:7]]).\n\nFollowing their appointment, the President appoints a number of [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-Presidents]] (the High Representative is mandated to be one of them) from among the commissioners. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he is away.<ref name=\"bbc examine\"/>\n\n===Dismissal===\nThe European Parliament can dissolve the Commission as a whole following a vote of no-confidence but only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the Council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).\n\n===Political styles===\nThe [[Barroso Commission]] took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style of control over the college, which earned him some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|publisher=EU Observer|title=EU commission sees civil servants' power grow|date=22 February 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/843/23553|accessdate=27 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under Barroso, the Commission began to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role.

A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the Commission and is used \"for justifying the EU and the commission\" increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves.

This results from systems composed solely of components (or digital algorithms) classified as having a linear response. Most filters implemented in [[analog electronics]], in [[digital signal processing]], or in mechanical systems are classified as [[causal]], [[time invariant]], and linear [[signal processing filter]]s.\n\nThe general concept of linear filtering is also used in [[statistics]], [[data analysis]], and [[mechanical engineering]] among other fields and technologies. This includes non-causal filters and filters in more than one dimension such as those used in image processing; those filters are subject to different constraints leading to different design methods.\n\n== Impulse response and transfer function ==\nA [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant]] (LTI) filter can be uniquely specified by its [[impulse response]] ''h'', and the output of any filter is mathematically expressed as the [[convolution]] of the input with that impulse response. The [[frequency response]], given by the filter's [[transfer function]] <math>H(\\omega)</math>, is an alternative characterization of the filter. Typical filter design goals are to realize a particular frequency response, that is, the magnitude of the transfer function <math>|H(\\omega)|</math>; the importance of the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the transfer function varies according to the application, inasmuch as the shape of a waveform can be distorted to a greater or lesser extent in the process of achieving a desired (amplitude) response in the frequency domain. The frequency response may be tailored to, for instance, eliminate unwanted frequency components from an input [[Signal (information theory)|signal]], or to limit an amplifier to signals within a particular band of frequencies.\n\nThe [[impulse response]] ''h'' of a linear time-invariant causal filter specifies the output that the filter would produce if it were to receive an input consisting of a single impulse at time 0. An \"impulse\" in a continuous time filter means a [[Dirac delta function]]; in a [[discrete time]] filter the [[Kronecker delta function]] would apply. The impulse response completely characterizes the response of any such filter, inasmuch as any possible input signal can be expressed as a (possibly infinite) combination of weighted delta functions. Multiplying the impulse response shifted in time according to the arrival of each of these delta functions by the amplitude of each delta function, and summing these responses together (according to the [[superposition principle]], applicable to all linear systems) yields the output waveform.\n\nMathematically this is described as the [[convolution]] of a time-varying input signal ''x(t)'' with the filter's [[impulse response]] ''h'', defined as:\n\n:<math>y(t) =  \\int_{0}^{T} x(t-\\tau)\\, h(\\tau)\\, d\\tau</math>\n:<math>y_k =  \\sum_{i=0}^{N} x_{k-i}\\, h_i </math>\n\nThe first form is the continuous-time form, which describes mechanical and analog electronic systems, for instance. The second equation is a discrete-time version used, for example, by digital filters implemented in software, so-called ''[[digital signal processing]]''. The impulse response ''h'' completely characterizes any linear time-invariant (or shift-invariant in the discrete-time case) filter. The input ''x'' is said to be \"[[convolved]]\" with the impulse response ''h'' having a (possibly infinite) duration of time ''T'' (or of ''N'' [[sampling period]]s).\n\nFilter design consists of finding a possible transfer function that can be implemented within certain practical constraints dictated by the technology or desired complexity of the system, followed by a practical design that realizes that transfer function using the chosen technology. The complexity of a filter may be specified according to the [[degree of a polynomial|order]] of the filter.\n\nAmong the time-domain filters we here consider, there are two general classes of filter transfer functions that can approximate a desired frequency response. Very different mathematical treatments apply to the design of filters termed [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) filters, characteristic of mechanical and analog electronics systems, and [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filters, which can be implemented by [[discrete time]] systems such as computers (then termed ''[[digital signal processing]]'').\n\n===Infinite impulse response filters ===\n\nConsider a physical system that acts as a linear filter, such as a system of springs and masses, or an analog electronic circuit that includes [[capacitor]]s and/or [[inductor]]s (along with other linear components such as [[resistor]]s and [[amplifier]]s). When such a system is subject to an impulse (or any signal of finite duration) it responds with an output waveform that lasts past the duration of the input, eventually decaying exponentially in one or another manner, but never completely settling to zero (mathematically speaking). Such a system is said to have an [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR). The convolution integral (or summation) above extends over all time: T (or N) must be set to infinity.\n\nFor instance, consider a damped harmonic oscillator such as a pendulum, or a resonant L-C [[tank circuit]]. If the pendulum has been at rest and we were to strike it with a hammer (the \"impulse\"), setting it in motion, it would swing back and forth (\"resonate\"), say, with an amplitude of 10&nbsp;cm. After 10 minutes, say, the pendulum would still be swinging but the amplitude would have decreased to 5&nbsp;cm, half of its original amplitude. After another 10 minutes its amplitude would be only 2.5&nbsp;cm, then 1.25&nbsp;cm, etc. However it would never come to a complete rest, and we therefore call that response to the impulse (striking it with a hammer) \"infinite\" in duration.\n\nThe complexity of such a system is specified by its order ''N''. N is often a constraint on the design of a transfer function since it specifies the number of reactive components in an analog circuit; in a digital IIR filter the number of computations required is proportional to N.\n\n===Finite impulse response filters ===\n\nA filter implemented in a computer program (or a so-called [[digital signal processor]]) is a discrete-time system; a different (but parallel) set of mathematical concepts defines the behavior of such systems. Although a [[digital filter]] can be an IIR filter if the algorithm implementing it includes [[feedback]], it is also possible to easily implement a filter whose impulse truly goes to zero after N time steps; this is called a [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter.\n\nFor instance, suppose one has a filter that, when presented with an impulse in a time series:\n: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ...\noutputs a series that responds to that impulse at time 0 until time 4, and has no further response, such as:\n: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.....\nAlthough the impulse response has lasted 4 time steps after the input, starting at time 5 it has truly gone to zero. The extent of the impulse response is ''finite'', and this would be classified as a fourth-order FIR filter.\nThe convolution integral (or summation) above need only extend to the full duration of the impulse response T, or the order N in a discrete time filter.\n\n=== Implementation issues ===\n\nClassical analog filters are IIR filters, and classical filter theory centers on the determination of transfer functions given by low order [[rational functions]], which can be synthesized using the same small number of reactive components.<ref>However, there are a few cases in which FIR filters directly process analog signals, involving non-feedback topologies and analog delay elements. An example is the discrete-time ''[[analog sampled filter]]'', implemented using a so-called [[bucket-brigade device]] clocked at a certain sampling rate, outputting copies of the input signal at different delays that can be combined with some weighting to realize an FIR filter. Electromechanical filters such as [[Electronic filter#SAW filters|SAW filters]] can likewise implement FIR filter responses; these operate in continuous time and can thus be designed for higher frequencies.</ref> Using digital computers, on the other hand, both FIR and IIR filters are straightforward to implement in software.\n\nA digital IIR filter can generally approximate a desired filter response using less computing power than a FIR filter, however this advantage is more often unneeded given the increasing power of digital processors. The ease of designing and characterizing FIR filters makes them preferable to the filter designer (programmer) when ample computing power is available. Another advantage of  FIR filters is that their impulse response can be made symmetric, which implies a response in the frequency domain that has [[linear phase|zero phase at all frequencies]] (not considering a finite delay), which is absolutely impossible with any IIR filter.<ref>Outside of trivial cases, stable IIR filters with zero phase response are possible if they are not causal (and thus are unusable in real-time applications) or implementing transfer functions classified as unstable or \"marginally stable\" such as a [[double integrator]].</ref>\n\n== Frequency response ==\n\nThe frequency response or [[transfer function]] <math>|H(\\omega)|</math> of a filter can be obtained if the impulse response is known, or directly through analysis using [[Laplace transform]]s, or in discrete-time systems the [[Z-transform]]. The frequency response also includes the phase as a function of frequency, however in many cases the phase response is of little or no interest. FIR filters can be made to have zero phase, but with IIR filters that is generally impossible. With most IIR transfer functions there are related transfer functions having a frequency response with the same magnitude but a different phase; in most cases the so-called [[minimum phase]] transfer function is preferred.\n\nFilters in the time domain are most often requested to follow a specified frequency response. Then, a mathematical procedure finds a filter transfer function that can be realized (within some constraints), and approximates the desired response to within some criterion. Common filter response specifications are described as follows:\n\n*A [[low-pass filter]] passes low frequencies while blocking higher frequencies.\n*A [[high-pass filter]] passes high frequencies.\n*A [[band-pass filter]] passes a band (range) of frequencies.\n*A [[band-stop filter]] passes high and low frequencies outside of a specified band.\n*A [[notch filter]] has a null response at a particular frequency. This function may be combined with one of the above responses.\n*An [[all-pass filter]] passes all frequencies equally well, but alters the phase relationship among them.\n*An equalization filter is not designed to fully pass or block any frequency, but instead to gradually vary the amplitude response as a function of frequency: filters used as [[pre-emphasis]] filters, [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]]s, or [[tone control]]s are good examples.\n\n===FIR transfer functions===\n\nMeeting a frequency response requirement with an FIR filter uses relatively straightforward procedures. In the most basic form, the desired frequency response itself can be sampled with a resolution of <math>\\Delta f</math> and Fourier transformed to the time domain. This obtains the filter coefficients ''h<sub>i</sub>'', which implements a zero phase FIR filter that matches the frequency response at the sampled frequencies used. To better match a desired response,  <math>\\Delta f</math> must be reduced. However the duration of the filter's impulse response, and the number of terms that must be summed for each output value (according to the above discrete time convolution) is given by  <math>N=1/(\\Delta f \\, T)</math> where ''T'' is the [[sampling period]] of the discrete time system (N-1 is also termed the ''order'' of an FIR filter). Thus the complexity of a digital filter and the computing time involved, grows inversely with <math>\\Delta f</math>, placing a higher cost on filter functions that better approximate the desired behavior. For the same reason, filter functions whose critical response is at lower frequencies (compared to the [[sampling frequency]] ''1/T'') require a higher order, more computationally intensive FIR filter. An IIR filter can thus be much more efficient in such cases.\n\nElsewhere the reader may find further discussion of design methods for [[FIR filter#Filter design|practical FIR filter design]].\n\n===IIR transfer functions===\n\nSince classical analog filters are IIR filters, there has been a long history of studying the range of possible transfer functions implementing various of the above desired filter responses in continuous time systems. Using [[Bilinear transform|transform]]s it is possible to convert these continuous time frequency responses to ones that are implemented in discrete time, for use in digital IIR filters. The complexity of any such filter is given by the ''order'' N, which describes the order of the [[rational function]] describing the frequency response. The order N is of particular importance in analog filters, because an N<sup>th</sup> order electronic filter requires N reactive elements (capacitors and/or inductors) to implement. If a filter is implemented using, for instance, [[Active filter|biquad stages]] using [[op-amp]]s, N/2 stages are needed. In a digital implementation, the number of computations performed per sample is proportional to N. Thus the mathematical problem is to obtain the best approximation (in some sense) to the desired response using a smaller N, as we shall now illustrate.\n\nBelow are the frequency responses of several standard filter functions that approximate a desired response, optimized according to some criterion. These are all fifth-order low-pass filters, designed for a cutoff frequency of .5 in normalized units. Frequency responses are shown for the  [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]], [[Chebyshev filter|Chebyshev]], [[chebyshev filter#Type II Chebyshev filters|inverse Chebyshev]], and [[elliptic filter]]s.\n\n[[Image:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]]\n\nAs is clear from the image, the elliptic filter is sharper than the others, but at the expense of [[ripple (filters)|ripples]] in both its passband and stopband. The Butterworth filter has the poorest transition but has a more even response, avoiding ripples in either the passband or stopband. A [[Bessel filter]] (not shown) has an even poorer transition in the frequency domain, but maintains the best phase fidelity of a waveform. Different applications emphasize different design requirements, leading to different choices among these (and other) optimizations, or requiring a filter of a higher order.\n\n[[Image:Sallen-Key Lowpass General.svg|thumb|300px|right|Low-pass filter implemented with a Sallen&ndash;Key topology]]\n\n==Example implementations==\n\nA popular circuit implementing a second order active R-C filter is the [[Sallen Key filter|Sallen-Key]] design, whose schematic diagram is shown here. This topology can be adapted to produce low-pass, band-pass, and high pass filters.\n\n[[File:FIR Filter.svg|thumb|300px|right|A discrete-time FIR filter of order ''N''. The top part is an ''N''-sample delay line; each delay step is denoted ''z''<sup>\u22121</sup>.]]\n\nAn N<sup>th</sup> order FIR filter can be implemented in a discrete time system using a computer program or specialized hardware in which the input signal is subject to N delay stages. The output of the filter is formed as the weighted sum of those delayed signals, as is depicted in the accompanying signal flow diagram. The response of the filter depends on the weighting coefficients denoted ''b<sub>0</sub>'', ''b<sub>1</sub>'', .... ''b<sub>N</sub>''. For instance, if all of the coefficients were equal to unity, a so-called [[boxcar function]], then it would implement a low-pass filter with a low frequency gain of N+1 and a frequency response given by the [[sinc function]]. Superior shapes for the frequency response can be obtained using coefficients derived from a more sophisticated design procedure.\n\n== Mathematics of filter design ==\n\n{{Linear analog electronic filter}}\n\n[[LTI system theory]] describes linear ''[[time-invariant]]'' (LTI) filters of all types. LTI filters can be completely described by their [[frequency response]] and [[phase response]], the specification of which uniquely defines their [[impulse response]], and ''vice versa''. From a mathematical viewpoint, continuous-time IIR LTI filters may be described in terms of linear [[differential equation]]s, and their impulse responses considered as [[Green's function]]s of the equation. Continuous-time LTI filters may also be described in terms of the [[Laplace transform]] of their impulse response, which allows all of the characteristics of the filter to be analyzed by considering the pattern of [[zeros and poles]] of their Laplace transform in the [[complex plane]].  Similarly, discrete-time LTI filters may be analyzed via the [[Z-transform]] of their impulse response.\n\nBefore the advent of computer filter synthesis tools, graphical tools such as [[Bode plot]]s and [[Nyquist plot]]s were extensively used as design tools. Even today, they are invaluable tools to understanding filter behavior.  Reference books<ref>A. Zverev, ''Handbook of Filter Synthesis'', John Wiley and Sons, 1967, {{ISBN|0-471-98680-1}}</ref> had extensive plots of frequency response, phase response, group delay, and impulse response for various types of filters, of various orders.  They also contained tables of values showing how to implement such filters as RLC ladders - very useful when amplifying elements were expensive compared to passive components.  Such a ladder can also be designed to have minimal sensitivity to component variation<ref>Normally, computing sensitivities is a very laborious operation.  But in the special case of an LC ladder driven by an impedance and terminated by a resistor, there is a neat argument showing the sensitivities are small.  In such as case, the transmission at the maximum frequency(s) transfers the maximal possible energy to the output load, as determined by the physics of the source and load impedances.  Since this point is a maximum, ''all'' derivatives with respect to ''all'' component values must be zero, since the result of changing ''any'' component value in ''any'' direction can only result in a reduction.  This result only strictly holds true at the peaks of the response, but is roughly true at nearby points as well.</ref> a property hard to evaluate without computer tools.\n\nMany different analog filter designs have been developed, each trying to optimise some feature of the system response. For practical filters, a custom design is sometimes desirable, that can offer the best tradeoff between different design criteria, which may include component count and cost, as well as filter response characteristics.\n\nThese descriptions refer to the ''mathematical'' properties of the filter (that is, the frequency and phase response). These can be ''implemented'' as analog circuits (for instance, using a [[Sallen Key filter]] topology, a type of [[active filter]]), or as algorithms in [[digital signal processing]] systems.\n\nDigital filters are much more flexible to synthesize and use than analog filters, where the constraints of the design permits their use. Notably, there is no need to consider component tolerances, and very high Q levels may be obtained.\n\nFIR digital filters may be implemented by the direct [[convolution]] of the desired impulse response with the input signal.\nThey can easily be designed to give a [[matched filter]] for any arbitrary pulse shape.\n\nIIR digital filters are often more difficult to design, due to problems including dynamic range issues, [[quantization noise]] and instability.\nTypically digital IIR filters are designed as a series of [[digital biquad filter]]s.\n\nAll low-pass second-order continuous-time filters have a [[transfer function]] given by\n\n: <math>H(s)=\\frac{K \\omega^{2}_{0}}{s^{2}+\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{Q}s+\\omega^{2}_{0}}.</math>\n\nAll band-pass second-order continuous-time filters have a transfer function given by\n\n: <math>H(s)=\\frac{K \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{Q}s}{s^{2}+\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{Q}s+\\omega^{2}_{0}}.</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''K'' is the gain (low-pass DC gain, or band-pass mid-band gain) (''K'' is 1 for passive filters)\n* ''Q'' is the [[Q factor]]\n* <math>\\omega_{0}</math> is the center frequency\n* <math>s=\\sigma+j\\omega</math> is the complex frequency\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Filter design]]\n* [[Laplace transform]]\n* [[Green's function]]\n* [[Prototype filter]]\n* [[Z-transform]]\n* [[System theory]]\n** [[LTI system theory]]\n* [[Nonlinear filter]]\n* [[Wiener filter]]\n* [[Gabor filter]]\n* [[Leapfrog filter]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Williams, Arthur B  |author2=Taylor, Fred J |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Electronic Filter Design Handbook|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1995|isbn=0-07-070441-4}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511220632/http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-779.pdf National Semiconductor AN-779] application note describing analog filter theory\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713191012/http://www.latticesemi.com/lit/docs/appnotes/pac/an6017.pdf Lattice AN6017] application note comparing and contrasting filters (in order of damping coefficient, from lower to higher values): Gaussian, Bessel, linear phase, Butterworth, Chebyshev, Legendre, elliptic.

Josephus' mention of the three-year duration of the Essene probation may be compared with the phased character of the entrance procedure in the Qumran Rule of the Community [1QS; at least two years plus an indeterminate initial catechetical phase, 1QS VI]. The provisional surrender of property required at the beginning of the last year of the novitiate derives from actual social experience of the difficulties of sharing property in a fully communitarian setting, cf.

They acknowledged Moses and believed that he had received laws\u2014not this law, however, but some other. And so, they were Jews who kept all the Jewish observances, but they would not offer sacrifice or eat meat. They considered it unlawful to eat meat or make sacrifices with it. They claim that these Books are fictions, and that none of these customs were instituted by the fathers.

Though it is different from the other six of these seven sects, it causes schism only by forbidding the books of Moses like the Nazarean.<ref name=\"panarion1-19\"/>}}\n\nIf it is correct to identify the community at Qumran with the Essenes (and claim that the community at Qumran are the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls), then according to the Dead Sea Scrolls the Essenes' community school was called \u201cYahad\u201d (meaning \u201ccommunity\u201d) in order to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Jews who are repeatedly labeled \u201cThe Breakers of the Covenant\u201d.\n\n== Scholarly discussion ==\n\n[[Josephus]] and [[Philo]] discuss the Essenes in detail. Most scholars believe that the community at Qumran that allegedly produced the Dead Sea Scrolls was an offshoot of the Essenes. However, this theory has been disputed by some; for example, [[Norman Golb]] argues that the primary research on the Qumran documents and ruins (by Father [[Roland de Vaux]], from the ''[[\u00c9cole Biblique|\u00c9cole Biblique et Arch\u00e9ologique de J\u00e9rusalem]]'') lacked scientific method, and drew wrong conclusions that comfortably entered the academic canon. For Golb, the amount of documents is too extensive and includes many different writing styles and calligraphies; the ruins seem to have been a fortress, used as a military base for a very long period of time\u2014including the 1st century\u2014so they therefore could not have been inhabited by the Essenes; and the large graveyard excavated in 1870, just {{convert|50|m}} east of the Qumran ruins, was made of over 1200 tombs that included many women and children; Pliny clearly wrote that the Essenes who lived near the Dead Sea \"had not one woman, had renounced all pleasure... and no one was born in their race\". Golb's book presents observations about de Vaux's premature conclusions and their uncontroverted acceptance by the general academic community. He states that the documents probably stemmed from various libraries in Jerusalem, kept safe in the desert from the Roman invasions.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Norman |last= Golb |authorlink=Norman Golb |title= Who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?: the search for the secret of Qumran |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location=New York City |year=1996 |isbn=0-684-80692-4 |oclc=35047608}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> Other scholars refute these arguments\u2014particularly since Josephus describes some Essenes as allowing marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Josephus|first= Flavius|title= Jewish War, Book II|location= Chapter 8, Paragraph 13}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue is the relationship between the ''Essaioi'' and Philo's ''[[Therapeutae]]'' and ''Therapeutrides''. He regarded the ''Therapeutae'' as a contemplative branch of the ''Essaioi'' who, he said, pursued an active life.<ref>[[Philo]]. ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html De Vita Contemplativa]''. I.1.</ref>\n\nOne theory on the formation of the Essenes suggests that the movement was founded by a Jewish high priest, dubbed by the Essenes the [[Teacher of Righteousness]], whose office had been usurped by [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]] (of priestly but not of [[Zadok]]ite lineage), labeled the \u201cman of lies\u201d or \u201cfalse priest\u201d.<ref name=time20090316/><ref name=\"elior-responds\"/> Others follow this line and a few argue that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran, but was also identical to the original Messianic figure about 150 years before the time of the Gospels.<ref name=Ellegard/> Fred Gladstone Bratton notes that\n{{quote|The Teacher of Righteousness of the Scrolls would seem to be a prototype of [[Jesus]], for both spoke of the [[New Covenant]]; they preached a similar gospel; each was regarded as a Savior or Redeemer; and each was condemned and put to death by reactionary factions...

See also WP policy [[WP:UNDUE]]--> directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. Based on [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s 1926 [[novella]] ''[[Dream Story|Traumnovelle]]'' (''Dream Story''), the story is transferred from early 20th-century Vienna to 1990s [[New York City]]. The film follows the sexually charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that she had contemplated having  an affair a year earlier. He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a massive masked [[orgy]] of an unnamed [[secret society]].\n\nKubrick obtained the filming rights for ''Dream Story'' in the 1960s, considering it a perfect text for a [[film adaptation]] about sexual relations. He revived the project only in the 1990s, when he hired writer [[Frederic Raphael]] to help him with the adaptation. The film, which was mostly shot in the [[United Kingdom]], apart from some exterior [[establishing shots]], includes a detailed recreation of exterior [[Greenwich Village]] street scenes made at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film's production, at 400 days, holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the longest continuous film shoot.\n\nKubrick died six days after showing his final cut to [[Warner Bros.]], making the film his final directorial effort.<ref name=\"Jan Harlan\">Jan Harlan, ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures''</ref> To ensure a theatrical [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R rating]] in the United States, Warner Bros. digitally altered several sexually explicit scenes during post-production.

The uncut version has since been released in [[DVD]], [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] formats.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Bill Harford ([[Tom Cruise|Cruise]]) and Alice ([[Nicole Kidman|Kidman]]) are a young married couple living in New York. They attend a Christmas party hosted by a wealthy patient, Victor Ziegler ([[Sydney Pollack|Pollack]]), where Bill is reunited with Nick Nightingale ([[Todd Field|Field]]), a medical school drop-out who now plays piano professionally. While a Hungarian man named Sandor Szavost ([[Sky du Mont|du Mont]]) attempts to seduce Alice, two young models attempt the same with Bill. He is interrupted by his host who had been having sex with Mandy ([[Julienne Davis|Davis]]), a young woman who has overdosed on a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]. Mandy recovers with Bill's aid.\n\nThe following evening at home, while smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], Alice asks him if he had sex with the two girls and Bill reassures her that he had not. She inquires if he is jealous of men who are attracted to her. He thinks women are more faithful than men. She tells him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had met on vacation. Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is called by the daughter ([[Marie Richardson|Richardson]])  of a patient who has just died. After visiting the home, he goes to a prostitute named Domino ([[Vinessa Shaw|Shaw]]), but Alice phones as Domino begins to kiss Bill. He then has a change of heart and leaves, \npaying Domino even though they had not done anything more than kissing. Meeting Nick at the jazz club, Bill learns that Nick has an engagement where he must play piano blindfolded. Bill learns that to gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask, and the password, which Nick had written down. Bill goes to a costume shop and offers the owner, Mr. Milich ([[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija|\u0160erbed\u017eija]]), a generous amount of money to rent a costume. In the shop, Milich catches his teenage daughter ([[Leelee Sobieski|Sobieski]]) with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of decency.\n\nBill takes a taxi to the country mansion mentioned by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a sexual ritual is taking place. A woman warns him he is in terrible danger. A porter then takes him to the ritual room, where a disguised red-cloaked master of ceremonies ([[Leon Vitali|Vitali]]) confronts Bill with a question about a second password. Bill says he has forgotten it. The masked woman who had tried to warn Bill intervenes and insists that she will redeem him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there.\n\nJust before dawn, Bill arrives home guilty and confused. He finds Alice laughing loudly in her sleep and awakens her. While crying, she tells him of a troubling dream in which she was having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them. Later that morning, Bill goes to Gillespie's Diner next door to the Sonata Cafe and asks a waitress there ([[Carmela Marner|Marner]]) if she happens to know Nick. She does but isn't forthcoming about his address. It's only when Bill intimates that he is Nick's doctor and that he has some test results that \"Nick would want to know about\" that the waitress directs him to Nick's hotel, where the desk clerk ([[Alan Cumming|Cumming]]) tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Bill goes to return the costume, but not the mask, which he has misplaced, and learns Milich has sold his daughter into prostitution.\n\nBill returns to the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by a man with a note warning him to cease his inquiries. After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy.  Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats.\n\nBill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd \"sacrificed\" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the \"punishment\" was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know whether Ziegler is telling the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further.\n\nWhen he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, \"Fuck.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Dr. William \"Bill\" Harford\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Alice Harford\n* [[Sydney Pollack]] as Victor Ziegler\n* [[Todd Field]] as Nick Nightingale\n* [[Marie Richardson]] as Marion Nathanson\n* [[Sky du Mont]] as Sandor Szavost\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Mr. Milich\n* [[Vinessa Shaw]] as Domino\n* [[Fay Masterson]] as Sally\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Hotel Desk Clerk\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Milich's daughter\n* [[Leon Vitali]] as Red Cloak\n* [[Julienne Davis]] as Mandy\n* [[Carmela Marner]] as Waitress at Gillespie's\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nWhile Stanley Kubrick was interested in making a film about sexual relations as early as 1962, during production of ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} the project only took off after he read Arthur Schnitzler's ''Dream Story'' in 1968, when he was seeking a work to follow ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Kubrick got interested in adapting the story, and with the help of then-journalist [[Jay Cocks]], bought the filming rights to the novel.<ref name=\"time\">{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,991414-1,00.html|title=All Eyes On Them|author=[[Richard Schickel|Schickel, Richard]]|first=|date=July 5, 1999|work=Time|accessdate=2018-02-18}}</ref> In the 1970s, Kubrick had thought of [[Woody Allen]] as the Jewish protagonist.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2005|p=222}} For the following decade, Kubrick even considered making his ''Dream Story'' adaptation a sex comedy \"with a wild and somber streak running through it\", starring [[Steve Martin]] in the main role.<ref name=vf>[[Michael Herr|Herr, Michael]]. [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/kubrick-199908 CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD: Kubrick], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (August 1999)</ref> The project was only revived in 1994, when Kubrick hired Frederic Raphael to work on the script, updating the setting from early 20th century Vienna to late 20th century New York City.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Kubrick invited [[Michael Herr]], a personal friend who helped write ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', for revisions, but Herr declined for fear that he would both be underpaid and would commit to an overlong production.<ref name=vf/>\n\n===Adaptation===\nArthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella ''Dream Story'' is set around [[Vienna]] shortly after the turn of the century. The main characters are a couple named Fridolin and Albertina; their home is a typical [[suburb]]an middle-class home, not the film's posh urban apartment. Schnitzler himself, like the protagonist of this novel, lived in Vienna, was Jewish, and a medical doctor, though Schnitzler eventually abandoned medicine for writing.\n\nWhile Fridolin and Albertina, the protagonist couple of ''Dream Story'', are sometimes implied to be [[Judaism|Jewish]], there is nothing in the novella which justifies this assumption, and neither Fridolin nor Albertina are typical Jewish names; whereas Nachtigall (Nightingale) is overtly identified as Jewish. Kubrick (himself of Jewish descent) frequently removed references to the Jewishness of characters in the novels he adapted.<ref name=cocks29>{{harvnb|Cocks|2004|p=29}}</ref> In the case of ''Eyes Wide Shut'', Frederic Raphael (who is also Jewish) wanted to keep the Jewish background of the protagonists, but Kubrick insisted that they should be \"vanilla\" Americans, without any details that would arouse any presumptions. The director added that Bill should be a \"[[Harrison Ford]]-ish [[Gentile|goy]]\" (though Ford's mother was Jewish), and created the surname of Harford as an allusion to the actor.{{sfn|Raphael|2000|p=59}} This is reflected in the way the film's Bill Harford is taunted by college students when going home in the morning. In the film, Bill is taunted with [[Homophobia|homophobic]] slurs. In the novella, these boys are recognized to be members of an [[anti-Semitic]] college fraternity.<ref name=cocks29/><ref>Lowenberg, Peter. \"Freud, Schnitzler, and Eyes Wide Shut,\" in ''[[#Depth|Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history]]'' (2006), pp.&nbsp;255\u2013279.</ref> Kubrick's co-screenwriter, Frederic Raphael, in an introduction to a Penguin Classics edition of ''Dream Story'', writes \"Fridolin is not declared to be a Jew, but his feelings of cowardice, for failing to challenge his aggressor, echo the uneasiness of Austrian Jews in the face of Gentile provocation.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Dream Story |last=Schnitzler |first=Arthur |authorlink= |author2=Fredric Raphael |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0-14-118224-5 |page=xiii |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe novella is set during the [[Carnival]], when people often wear masks to parties. The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a Carnival [[Masquerade ball]], whereas the film's story begins at Christmas time.\n\nCritic Randy Rasmussen suggests that the character of Bill is fundamentally more na\u00efve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2005|p=331}}</ref> For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits one of his own (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.\n\nIn the novella, the husband long suspected that his patient (Marion) was infatuated with him, while in the film it is a complete surprise and he seems shocked. He is also more overwhelmed by the orgy in the film than in the novella. Fridolin is socially bolder but less sexual with the prostitute (Mizzi in the novella, Domino in the film). Fridolin is also conscious of looking old in the novella, though he hardly does in the film.\n\nIn the novella, the party (which is sparsely attended) uses \"Denmark\" as the password for entrance; that is significant in that Albertina had her infatuation with her soldier in Denmark. The film's password is \"Fidelio\", from the Latin word for \"faithful\", and which is the title of [[Beethoven]]'s only opera (''[[Fidelio|Fidelio, or Married Love]]''). In early drafts of the screenplay, the password was \"Fidelio Rainbow\". Jonathan Rosenbaum noted that both passwords echo elements of one member of the couple's behaviour, though in opposite ways.<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. \"In Dreams Begin Responsibilities\"; in ''[[#Depth|Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history]]'' (2006), pp.&nbsp;245\u2013254</ref> The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing.\n\nIn the novella, the woman who \"redeems\" Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or monks; Fridolin himself used a monk costume. This aspect was retained in the film's original screenplay,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/eyeswshu.htm |title=Eyes Wide Shut original screenplay |publisher=Godamongdirectors.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> but was deleted in the filmed version.\n\nIn the novella, when the husband returns home, the wife's dream is an elaborate drama that concludes with him getting [[crucified]] in a village square after Fridolin refuses to separate from Albertina and become the paramour of the village princess, even though Albertina is now occupied with copulating with other men, and watches him \"without pity\". By being faithful, Fridolin thus fails to save himself from execution in Albertina's dream, although he was apparently spared by the woman's \"sacrifice\" at the masked sex party. In both the novella and film, the wife states that the laugh in her sleep just before she woke was a laugh of scornful contempt for her husband; although awake, she states this matter-of-factly. The novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together \"like mortal enemies\". It has been argued that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina's dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill's visit to the secret society's orgy, whose content is more shocking in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html |title=Rainer J. Kaus, ''Notes on Eyes Wide Shut'' |publisher=Clas.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>\n\nThe adaptation created a character with no counterpart in the novella: Ziegler, who represents both the high wealth and prestige to which Bill Harford aspires, and a connection between Bill's two worlds (his regular life, and the secret society organizing the ball).{{sfn|Chion|2002 |p= 21}} Critic Randy Rasmussen interprets Ziegler as representing Bill's worst self, much as in other Kubrick films; the title character in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' represents the worst of the American national security establishment, Charles Grady represents the worst of [[Jack Torrance]] in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', and Clare Quilty represents the worst of Humbert Humbert in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2005 |p= 332}}</ref>\n\nZiegler's presence allows Kubrick to change the mechanics of the story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Caf\u00e9. In the novella, the caf\u00e9 encounter with Nightingale is a delightful coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being the woman at the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.\n\nMore significantly, in the film, Ziegler gives a commentary on the whole story to Bill, including an explanation that the party incident, where Bill is apprehended, threatened, and ultimately redeemed by the woman's sacrifice, was staged. Whether this is to be believed or not, it is an exposition of Ziegler's view of the ways of the world as a member of the power elite.{{sfn|Cocks|2004 |p= 146}}\n\nThe novella explains why the husband's mask is on the pillow next to his sleeping wife, she having discovered it when it slipped out of his suitcase, and placing it there as a statement of understanding. This is left unexplained in the film and left to the viewer's interpretation.\n\n===Casting===\nWhen Warner Bros. president [[Terry Semel]] approved production, he asked Kubrick to cast a movie star, as \"you haven't done that since [[Jack Nicholson]] [in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'']\".<ref name=time/> Cruise was in England because his wife [[Nicole Kidman]] was there shooting ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'', and eventually Cruise decided to visit Kubrick's estate with Kidman.

Kubrick refused to use studio lighting, forcing Smith to use the available light sources visible in the shot, such as lamps and Christmas tree lights. When this was not adequate, Smith used Chinese paper ball lamps to softly brighten the scene. The color was enhanced by [[push processing]] the film reels, which helped bring out the intensity of color.<ref name=asc/>\n\nKubrick's perfectionism led him to oversee every visual element that would appear in a given frame, from props and furniture to the color of walls and other objects.<ref name=asc>{{cite journal|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct99/sword/pg1.htm|title=A Sword in the Bed|first=Stephen|last=Pizzella|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|issue=33|date=28 October 1999}}</ref> One such element were the masks used in the orgy, which were inspired by the masked Carnival balls visited by the protagonists of the novel. Costume designer Marit Allen explained that Kubrick felt they fit in that scene for being part of the imaginary world, and ended up \"creat[ing] the impression of menace, but without exaggeration\". Many masks as used in the Venetian carnival were sent to London, and Kubrick separated who would wear each piece.{{sfn|Ciment|2003|p. 177}} The paintings of Kubrick's wife Christiane and his daughter Katharina are featured on decoration.<ref>[http://sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/ornament/#b6 ''Eyes Wide Shut''], ''[[Senses of Cinema]]''</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=James|first=Nick|date=September 1999|title=At Home with the Kubrick's|url=|magazine=[[Sight and Sound]]|volume=9|issue=9|page=12|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter shooting completed, Kubrick entered a prolonged post-production process.

The previous DVD release used a 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. It is also the first American home video release to feature the uncut version. Although the earliest American DVD of the uncut version states on the cover that it includes both the R-rated and unrated editions, in actuality only the unrated edition is on the DVD.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Debate over the film's state of completion===\nThough Warner Bros. insisted that Kubrick had turned in his final cut before his death, the film was still in the final stages of post-production, which was therefore completed by the studio in collaboration with Kubrick's estate.  Some have argued that the work which remained was minor and exclusively technical in nature, allowing the estate to faithfully complete the film based on the director's notes.  However, decisions regarding sound mixing, scoring and color-correction would have necessarily been made without Kubrick's input.  Furthermore, Kubrick had a history of continuing to edit his films up until the last minute, and in some cases even after initial public screenings, as had been the case with ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''The Shining''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allman|first=Marshall|title=Kubrick's Final Film Reimagined|url=https://www.eyeswidecut.com/inspiration/|accessdate=2018-08-24}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''Vanity Fair'', Kubrick collaborator Michael Herr recalled a phone call from the director regarding the cut that would be screened for the Warner Bros. executives four days before his death:\n\n{{quote|text=... there was looping to be done and the music wasn't finished, lots of small technical fixes on color and sound; would I show work that wasn't finished?

But the truth is that&nbsp; ... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more completely subservient and prostrate themselves at the feet of a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about [[R. Lee Ermey]] for ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because there is no reason to do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.</blockquote>\n\nIn a [[reddit]] \"Ask Me Anything\" session, Stanley Kubrick's daughter, Katharina Kubrick, claimed that her father was very proud of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134rvs/stanley_kubricks_daughter_katharina_kubrick_and/c70tgdp |title=littleroom comments on Stanley Kubrick's daughter Katharina Kubrick, and grandson Joe.

In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] from one generation to another. Education can also be defined as the process of becoming an educated person.<ref>Don, Berg. \"Definition of Education.\" teach-kids-attitude-1st.com. N.p., n.d.

The basic concept launched was that all the things we see in this world are actually the copy not original.  What ever we produce here becomes an idea in our mind. So whatever we work to create something is first takes shape in ideas and minds, so the true reality is Idealism.They both supported an education which provides the opportunity to develop mental faculties and make student think properly to find any reality.\n** [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] \u2013 Aristotle, the pupil of Plato was the person who got the concept of Realism and argued that the Idealism is not the only reality, but there are many natural things which are the part of our atmosphere and we come across those things. Whatever we observe is very important to work on and find the realities using empirical evidences. So the education that is based on experience and observable realities will guide the students to find out the reality. The same has relevance to the philosophy of Positivism.\n** [[Educational perennialism|Perennialism]] \u2013 This concept was introduced by Robert Hutchins who was of a view that the education should have ever-lasting impact on the students and therefore the only ever-last ideas should be taught. for that he supported the religious concepts to be incorporated in the curriculum.\n** [[Existentialism]] \u2013 Kierkegaard argued that all the philosophers are of a view to inculcate into the students which is something outdoor with reference to the students. He told that realities are subjective and they are with the individuals themselves. The education should work on individuals to harness the inner realities.\n** [[Theism]] \u2013 Thomas Aquinas introduced the church doctrine in education and emphasized that reason and faith are complimentary so the both ideas should be the base of education and the students should go by the reasons introduced by the faith, church or religion.\n** [[Essentialism]] \u2013 The education philosophies were taking many turns in the twentieth century when William Bagley raised his voice to attract the attention of the theoreticians telling that the education should have a core basics of the culture and heritage. The students should be given choice of study the said core subject and they should go to the 1930s education where the same was used to teach.\n** [[Pragmatism]] \u2013 John Dewey was the person who told that in education a democratic view is to be implemented. Students should be given a chance to explore themselves and they should go by their own instinctive drives.\n** [[Critical thinking]] \u2013 There was a team of German theoreticians like Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas who gave the concept of Critical Theory and argued that the education which provides the students and prepare them to analyze the things under discussion, is the basic requirement of education.\n** [[Social education]] \u2013 In his book, Social Education, Applied Perspective, Muhammad Zahid Azeem Zahid has argued that the education which provides the opportunity to the students to find their space in society and the education should be in line with the societal need not only individually but holistically as well. The Social Education Model is to be implemented in the third world countries as there is a big need to join the individual and society. An educated person can become a good professional and can lead a good life individually, but the need of the day is that he or she should keep his profession and the lifestyle favorable to the society as well....\n\n==Branches of education==\n\n===Education by level or stage===\n\n* [[Early childhood education]]\n* [[Primary education]]\n* [[Secondary education]]\n* [[Higher education]]\n** [[Vocational education]]\n** [[Tertiary education]]\n\n===Education by sector===\n\n* [[Academia]]\n* [[Adult education]]\n* [[Alternative education]]\n* [[Autodidacticism]]\n* [[Homeschooling]]\n* [[Public education]]\n* [[Private education]]\n\n===Education by specialization or department===\n\n* [[Inclusive education]]\n* [[Madrasa education]]\n* [[Woman education]]\n* [[Early childhood education]]\n* [[Teacher education]]\n* [[Agricultural education]]\n* [[Art education]]\n* [[Business education]]\n* [[Career and technical education]]\n* [[Chemistry education]]\n* [[Computer science education]]\n* [[Cultural studies]]\n* [[Dance education]]\n* [[Distance education]]\n* [[Economics education]]\n* [[Engineering education]]\n* [[Environmental education]]\n* [[Gifted education]]\n* [[Health education]]\n* [[International studies]]\n* [[Journalism education]]\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Legal education]]\n* [[Management education]]\n* [[Maritime education]]\n* [[Mathematics education]]\n* [[Medical education]]\n* [[Military education and training]]\n* [[Museum education]]\n* [[Music education]]\n* [[Peace education]]\n* [[Performing arts education]]\n* [[Philosophy education]]\n* [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]\n* [[Physical education]]\n* [[Physics education]]\n* [[Relationship education]]\n* [[Religious education]]\n* [[Science education]]\n* [[Sex education]]\n* [[Special education]]\n* [[Vocational education]]\n\n===Academic disciplines===\n{{Main article|List of academic disciplines}}\n\n== Educational certifications (for students) ==\n\n* [[School leaving qualification]]\n* [[Diploma]]\n* [[Academic degree]] \u2013 an academic rank, title or award, including:\n** [[Foundation degree]]\n** [[Associate's degree]]\n** [[Bachelor's degree]]\n** [[Master's degree]]\n** [[Doctorate]]\n** [[Engineer's degree]]\n** [[Specialist degree]]\n** [[Ad eundem degree]]\n** [[Honorary degree]]\n** [[Lambeth degree]]\n** [[External degree]]\n**[[Microdegree]]\n* [[Vocational degree]] \u2013 award in vocational education\n\n== Educational qualifications (for teachers) ==\n* [[Bachelor of Education]]\n* [[Master of Education]]\n* [[Doctor of Education]]\n\n==History of education==\n\n[[History of education]]\n* [[Academia#History|History of academia]]\n* [[Classics|Classical education]]\n* [[History of education in China]]\n* [[History of education in India]]\n* [[History of education in Japan]]\n* [[History of education in the United States]]\n* [[Popular education]]\n\n== Educational organizations ==\n* [[Students' union]]\n* [[Parent-Teacher Association]]\n\n=== Libraries ===\n \n* [[Library]] \u2013 collection, or institution that provides a collection, of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.

However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].

has been attributed by modern scholars to the collective of two [[Medieval Iceland]]ic literary works: what is now known as the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and an older collection of poems without an original title now known as the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. The term historically referred only to the ''Prose Edda'', but this since has fallen out of use because of the confusion with the other work. Both works were written down in [[medieval Iceland|Iceland]] during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the [[Viking Age]]. The books are the main sources of medieval [[skald]]ic tradition in Iceland and [[Norse mythology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are several hypotheses concerning the origins of the word ''edda''. One hypothesis holds that it is identical to a word that means \"great-grandmother\" appearing in the Eddic poem ''R\u00edgs\u00feula.''<ref>Snorri Sturluson.  ''The Prose Edda: Tales from Norse Mythology'', translated by Jean I. Young (University of California Press, 1964), p. 8.</ref> Another hypothesis holds that ''edda'' derives from Old Norse ''\u00f3\u00f0r'', \"poetry\".  A third, proposed in 1895 by Eir\u00edkr Magn\u00fasson, is that it derives from the Icelandic place name ''[[Oddi]]'', site of the church and school where students, including [[Snorri Sturluson]], were educated.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Liberman | first1 = Anatoly | year = 1996 | title = Ten Scandinavian and North English Etymologies | url = | journal = Alv\u00edssm\u00e1l | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 63\u201398 }}</ref> A fourth hypothesis\u2014the derivation of the word ''Edda'' as the name of Snorri Sturluson\u2019s treatise on poetry from the Latin ''edo'', \"I compose (poetry)\", by analogy with ''kredda'', \"superstition\", from Latin ''credo'', \"creed\"\u2014is now widely accepted, though this acceptance may stem from its agreement with modern usage rather than historical accuracy.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages'' (2010) under \"Snorri Sturluson\"</ref>\n\n==The ''Poetic Edda''==\n{{main|Poetic Edda}}\nThe ''Poetic Edda'', also known as ''S\u00e6mundar Edda'' or the ''Elder Edda'', is a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems from the [[Iceland]]ic medieval [[manuscript]] [[Codex Regius]] (\"Royal Book\"). Along with the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the ''Poetic Edda'' is the most expansive source on Norse mythology. The first part of the Codex Regius preserves poems that narrate the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Old Norse mythological world as well as individual myths about gods concerning [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse deities]]. The poems in the second part narrate legends about [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse heroes and heroines]], such as [[Sigurd]], [[Brynhildr]] and [[Gunnar]].\n\nThe Codex Regius was written in the 13th century, but nothing is known of its whereabouts until 1643, when it came into the possession of [[Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson]], then the [[Church of Iceland]]'s Bishop of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]]. At that time, versions of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' were well known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another ''Edda''\u2014an ''Elder Edda''\u2014which contained the [[Norse paganism|pagan]] poems Snorri quotes in his book. When the Codex Regius was discovered, it seemed that this speculation had proven correct. Brynj\u00f3lfur attributed the manuscript to [[Saemund|S\u00e6mundr the Learned]], a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest. While this attribution is rejected by modern scholars, the name ''S\u00e6mundar Edda'' is still sometimes encountered.\n\nBishop Brynj\u00f3lfur sent the Codex Regius as a present to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], hence the name ''Codex Regius''. For centuries it was stored in the [[Royal Library, Copenhagen|Royal Library]] in [[Copenhagen]] but in 1971 it was returned to Iceland.\n\n==The ''Prose Edda''==\n{{main|Prose Edda}}\nThe ''Prose Edda'', sometimes referred to as the ''Younger Edda'' or ''Snorri's Edda'', is an [[Iceland]]ic manual of poetics which also contains many mythological stories. Its purpose was to enable [[Iceland]]ic poets and readers to understand the subtleties of [[alliterative verse]], and to grasp the mythological allusions behind the many ''[[kenning]]s'' that were used in [[skaldic poetry]].\n\nIt was written by the Icelandic scholar and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] around 1220. It survives in four known manuscripts and three fragments, written down from about 1300 to about 1600.<ref name=\"Wanner2008\">{{cite book| author=Kevin J.

The intent was to define a uniform time (as far as was then feasible) based on Newtonian theory (see below: [[#Definition of ephemeris time (1952)|Definition of ephemeris time (1952)]]).  Ephemeris time was a first application of the concept of a [[dynamical time scale]], in which the time and time scale are defined implicitly, inferred from the observed position of an astronomical object via the dynamical theory of its motion.<ref>[[#refGuin1988|B Guinot and P K Seidelmann (1988)]], at p.304-5.</ref>\n# a modern relativistic coordinate time scale, implemented by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] ephemeris time argument T<sub>eph</sub>, in a series of numerically integrated [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Development Ephemerides]].

The time scale represented by T<sub>eph</sub> is closely related to, but distinct (by an offset and constant rate) from, the [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]] time scale currently adopted as a standard by the [[IAU]] (see below: [[#JPL ephemeris time argument Teph|JPL ephemeris time argument Teph]]).<ref name=EMS1998>[[#refEMS1998|E M Standish (1998)]].</ref>\n\nMost of the following sections relate to the ephemeris time of the 1952 standard.\n\nAn impression has sometimes arisen that ephemeris time was in use from 1900:  this probably arose because ET, though proposed and adopted in the period 1948\u20131952, was defined in detail using formulae that made retrospective use of the epoch date of 1900 [[January 0]] and of [[Simon Newcomb|Newcomb]]'s [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|Tables of the Sun]].<ref name=NewcSun>[[#refNewcSun|S Newcomb (1895)]].</ref><ref>For the components of the definition including its retrospective aspect, see [[#refClem1948|G M Clemence (1948)]], esp. p.172, and [[#refESAE|'ESAE 1961': 'Explanatory Supplement (1961)]], esp. pages 69 and 87.</ref>\n\nThe ephemeris time of the 1952 standard leaves a continuing legacy, through its ephemeris second which became closely duplicated in the length of the current standard SI [[second]] (see below: [[#Redefinition of the second|Redefinition of the second]]).\n\n==History (1952 standard)==\n'''Ephemeris time''' ('''ET'''), adopted as standard in 1952, was originally designed as an approach to a uniform time scale, to be freed from the effects of irregularity in the rotation of the earth, \"for the convenience of astronomers and other scientists\", for example for use in [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] of the Sun (as observed from the Earth), the Moon, and the planets.  It was proposed in 1948 by [[Gerald Maurice Clemence|G M Clemence]].<ref name=Clemence1948>[[#refClem1948|G M Clemence (1948)]].</ref>\n\nFrom the time of [[John Flamsteed]] (1646\u20131719) it had been believed that the Earth's daily rotation was uniform.  But in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with increasing precision of astronomical measurements, it began to be suspected, and was eventually established, that the rotation of the Earth (''i.e.'' the length of the [[day]]) showed irregularities on short time scales, and was slowing down on longer time scales.  The evidence was compiled by [[Willem de Sitter|W de Sitter]] (1927)<ref>[[#refSitter1927|W de Sitter (1927)]].</ref> who wrote \"If we accept this hypothesis, then the 'astronomical time', given by the earth's rotation, and used in all practical astronomical computations, differs from the 'uniform' or 'Newtonian' time, which is defined as the independent variable of the equations of celestial mechanics\".  De Sitter offered a correction to be applied to the mean solar time given by the Earth's rotation to get uniform time.\n\nOther astronomers of the period also made suggestions for obtaining uniform time, including [[Andre Danjon|A Danjon]] (1929), who suggested in effect that observed positions of the Moon, Sun and planets, when compared with their well-established gravitational ephemerides, could better and more uniformly define and determine time.<ref name=Clemence1971>[[#refClem1971|G M Clemence (1971)]].</ref>\n\nThus the aim developed, to provide a new time scale for astronomical and scientific purposes, to avoid the unpredictable irregularities of the [[Solar time#Mean solar time|mean solar time]] scale, and to replace for these purposes [[Universal Time]] (UT) and any other time scale based on the rotation of the Earth around its axis, such as [[sidereal time]].\n\n[[Gerald Maurice Clemence|G M Clemence]] (1948)<ref name=\"Clemence1948\" /> made a detailed proposal of this type based on the results of [[Harold Spencer Jones|H Spencer Jones]] (1939).<ref name=HSJ1939>[[#refHSJ1939|H Spencer Jones (1939)]].</ref>  Clemence (1948) made it clear that his proposal was intended \"for the convenience of astronomers and other scientists only\" and that it was \"logical to continue the use of mean solar time for civil purposes\".<ref>[[#refClem1948|Clemence (1948)]], at p. 171.</ref>\n\nDe Sitter and Clemence both referred to the proposal as 'Newtonian' or 'uniform' time. [[Dirk Brouwer|D Brouwer]] suggested the name 'ephemeris time'.<ref name=ESAAp79>[[#refESAA|ESAA (1992)]], see [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&pg=PA79 page 79].</ref>\n\nFollowing this, an astronomical conference held in Paris in 1950 recommended \"that in all cases where the mean solar second is unsatisfactory as a unit of time by reason of its variability, the unit adopted should be the sidereal year at 1900.0, that the time reckoned in this unit be designated ''ephemeris time''\", and gave Clemence's formula (see [[#Definition of ephemeris time (1952)|Definition of ephemeris time (1952)]]) for translating mean solar time to ephemeris time.\n\nThe [[International Astronomical Union]] approved this recommendation at its 1952 general assembly.<ref name=ESAAp79 /><ref>At the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] meeting in Rome 1952: see [[#refESAE|ESAE (1961)]] at sect.1C, p. 9;  also [[#refClem1971|Clemence (1971)]].</ref>  Practical introduction took some time (see [[#Use of ephemeris time in official almanacs and ephemerides|Use of ephemeris time in official almanacs and ephemerides]]);  ephemeris time (ET) remained a standard until superseded in the 1970s by further time scales (see [[#Revision of time scales|Revision]]).\n \nDuring the currency of ephemeris time as a standard, the details were revised a little. The unit was redefined in terms of the tropical year at 1900.0 instead of the sidereal year;<ref name=ESAAp79 /> and the standard second was defined first as 1/31556925.975 of the tropical year at 1900.0,<ref name=ESAAp79 /><ref>ESAA 1992, p. 79: citing decision of [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM), Sept 1954.</ref> and then as the slightly modified fraction 1/31556925.9747 instead,<ref>[[#refESAA|ESAA (1992)]], see [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&pg=PA80 page 80], citing CIPM recommendation Oct 1956, adopted 1960 by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM).</ref> finally being redefined in 1967/8 in terms of the cesium atomic clock standard (see below).\n\nAlthough ET is no longer directly in use, it leaves a continuing legacy.  Its successor time scales, such as TDT, as well as the atomic time scale [[International Atomic Time|IAT (TAI)]], were designed with a relationship that \"provides continuity with ephemeris time\".<ref name=ESAAp42>[[#refESAA|ESAA (1992)]], at [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&pg=PA42 page 42].</ref>  ET was used for the calibration of atomic clocks in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Mark1958\" />  Close equality between the ET second with the later [[Second#International second|SI second]] (as defined with reference to the cesium atomic clock) has been verified to within 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup>.<ref name=\"refMark1988\">[[#refMark1988|Wm Markowitz (1988)]].</ref>\n\nIn this way, decisions made by the original designers of ephemeris time influenced the length of today's [[Second#International second|standard SI second]], and in turn, this has a continuing influence on the number of [[leap second]]s which have been needed for insertion into current broadcast time scales, to keep them approximately in step with [[Solar time#Mean solar time|mean solar time]].\n\n==Definition (1952)==\nEphemeris time was defined in principle by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun,<ref name=ESAAp79 /> (but its practical implementation was usually achieved in another way, see below).\n\nIts detailed definition depended on [[Simon Newcomb]]'s [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|Tables of the Sun]] (1895),<ref name=NewcSun /> interpreted in a new way to accommodate certain observed discrepancies:\n\nIn the introduction to [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]] (1895) the basis of the tables (p.&nbsp;9) includes a formula for the Sun's mean longitude, at a time indicated by interval T (in Julian centuries of 36525 mean solar days<ref>The unit of _mean solar_ day is left implicit on p.9 but made explicit on p.20 of [[#refNewcSun|Newcomb (1895)]].</ref>) reckoned from Greenwich Mean Noon on 0 January 1900:\n\n: Ls = 279\u00b0 41' 48\".04 + 129,602,768\".13T +1\".089T<sup>2</sup> . . . . . (1)\n\nSpencer Jones' work of 1939<ref name=\"HSJ1939\" /> showed that the positions of the Sun actually observed, when compared with those obtained from Newcomb's formula, show the need for the following correction to the formula to represent the observations:\n\n: &Delta;Ls = + 1\".00  + 2\".97T  + 1\".23T<sup>2</sup>  + 0.0748B\n\n(where \"the times of observation are in Universal time, not corrected to Newtonian time\", and 0.0748B represents an irregular fluctuation calculated from lunar observations<ref name=Clem1948-172>[[#refClem1948|Clemence (1948)]], p.172, following [[#refHSJ1939|Spencer Jones (1939)]].</ref>).\n\nThus a conventionally corrected form of Newcomb's formula, to incorporate the corrections on the basis of mean solar time, would be the sum of the two preceding expressions:\n\n: Ls =\t279\u00b0 41' 49\".04 + 129,602,771\".10T +2\".32T<sup>2</sup> +0.0748B . . . . . (2)\n\nClemence's 1948 proposal did not adopt a correction of this kind in terms of mean solar time:  instead, the same numbers were used as in Newcomb's original uncorrected formula (1), but now in a reverse sense, to define the time and time scale implicitly, based on the real position of the Sun:\n\n: Ls =\t279\u00b0 41' 48\".04 + 129,602,768\".13E +1\".089E<sup>2</sup> . . . . . (3)\n\nwhere the time variable, here represented as E, now represents time in ephemeris centuries of 36525 ephemeris days of 86400 ephemeris seconds.  The 1961 official reference put it this way: \"The origin and rate of ephemeris time are defined to make the Sun's mean longitude agree with Newcomb's expression\"<ref>[[#refESAE|ESAE (1961)]] at p.70.</ref>\n\nFrom the comparison of formulae (2) and (3), both of which express the same real solar motion in the same real time but on different time scales, Clemence arrived at an explicit expression, estimating the difference in seconds of time between ephemeris time and mean solar time, in the sense (ET-UT):\n\n: <math> \\delta t = +24^s.349 + 72^s.3165T +29^s.949T^2 + 1.821B</math> . . . . . (4)<ref name=Clem1948-172 />\n\nClemence's formula, now superseded by more modern estimations, was included in the original conference decision on ephemeris time. In view of the fluctuation term, practical determination of the difference between ephemeris time and UT depended on observation.  Inspection of the formulae above shows that the (ideally constant) unit of ephemeris time such as the ephemeris second has been for the whole of the twentieth century very slightly shorter than the corresponding (but not precisely constant) unit of mean solar time (which besides its irregular fluctuations tends gradually to increase), consistently also with the modern results of Morrison and Stephenson<ref name=morr3>[[#morrste2004|L V Morrison & F R Stephenson (2004)]]; also [[#stemorr84|F R Stephenson, L V Morrison (1984)]], and [[#stemorr95|F R Stephenson, L V Morrison (1995)]].</ref> (see article [[delta T|&Delta;T]]).\n\n==Implementations==\n\n===Secondary realizations by lunar observations===\nAlthough ephemeris time was defined in principle by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun,<ref>[[#refClem1948|Clemence (1948)]], at pp.171-3.</ref> it was usually measured in practice by the orbital motion of the Moon around the Earth.<ref>[[#refMark1955|W Markowitz & others (1955)]]; [[#refMark1959|W Markowitz (1959)]]; also [[#refMark1958|W Markowitz, R G Hall, L Essen, J V L Parry (1958)]].</ref>  These measurements can be considered as secondary realizations (in a [[metrology|metrological]] sense) of the primary definition of ET in terms of the solar motion, after a calibration of the mean motion of the Moon with respect to the mean motion of the Sun.<ref name=guin88>\n[[#refGuin1988|B Guinot & P K Seidelmann (1988)]], at p.305.</ref>\n\nReasons for the use of lunar measurements were practically based: the Moon moves against the background of stars about 13 times as fast as the Sun's corresponding rate of motion, and the accuracy of time determinations from lunar measurements is correspondingly greater.\n\nWhen ephemeris time was first adopted, time scales were still based on astronomical observation, as they always had been.  The accuracy was limited by the accuracy of optical observation, and corrections of clocks and time signals were published in arrear.\n\n===Secondary realizations by atomic clocks===\nA few years later, with the invention of the [[atomic clock|cesium atomic clock]], an alternative offered itself.  Increasingly, after the calibration in 1958 of the cesium atomic clock by reference to ephemeris time,<ref name=\"Mark1958\" /> cesium atomic clocks running on the basis of ephemeris seconds began to be used and kept in step with ephemeris time.  The atomic clocks offered a further secondary realization of ET, on a quasi-real time basis<ref name=guin88 /> that soon proved to be more useful than the primary ET standard: not only more convenient, but also more precisely uniform than the primary standard itself. Such secondary realizations were used and described as 'ET', with an awareness that the time scales based on the atomic clocks were not identical to that defined by the primary ephemeris time standard, but rather, an improvement over it on account of their closer approximation to uniformity.<ref>[[#tr32-1306|W G Melbourne & others, 1968]], section II.E.4-5, pages 15-16, including footnote 7, noted that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft tracking and data reduction programs of that time (including the Single Precision Orbit Determination Program) used, as ET, the current US atomic clock time A.1 offset by 32.25 seconds. The discussion also noted that the usage was \"inaccurate\" (the quantity indicated was not identical with any of the other realizations of ET such as ET0, ET1), and that while A.1 gave \"certainly a closer approximation to uniform time than ET1\" there were no grounds for considering either the atomic clocks or any other measures of ET as (perfectly) uniform. Section II.F, pages 18-19, indicates that an improved time measure of (A.1 + 32.15 seconds), applied in the JPL Double Precision Orbit Determination Program, was also designated ET.</ref> The atomic clocks gave rise to the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time scale]], and to what was first called Terrestrial Dynamical Time and is now [[Terrestrial Time]], defined to provide continuity with ET.<ref name=ESAAp42 />\n\nThe availability of atomic clocks, together with the increasing accuracy of astronomical observations (which meant that relativistic corrections were at least in the foreseeable future no longer going to be small enough to be neglected),<ref>[[#refWink1977|G M R Winkler and T C van Flandern (1977)]].</ref> led to the eventual replacement of the ephemeris time standard by more refined time scales including [[terrestrial time]] and [[barycentric dynamical time]], to which ET can be seen as an approximation.\n\n==Revision of time scales==\nIn 1976 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] resolved that the theoretical basis for its current (1952) standard of Ephemeris Time was non-relativistic, and that therefore, beginning in 1984, Ephemeris Time would be replaced by two relativistic timescales intended to constitute [[Dynamical time scale|dynamical timescales]]: [[Terrestrial Time#History|Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT)]] and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)]].<ref>[[#refIAU1976|IAU resolutions (1976)]]; see also ESAA (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&pg=PA41 at p.41].</ref>  Difficulties were recognized, which led to these being in turn superseded in the 1990s by time scales [[Terrestrial Time|Terrestrial Time (TT)]], [[Geocentric Coordinate Time|Geocentric Coordinate Time GCT(TCG)]] and [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|Barycentric Coordinate Time BCT(TCB)]].<ref name=ESAAp42 />\n\n== JPL ephemeris time argument T<sub>eph</sub> ==\nHigh-precision [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] of sun, moon and planets were developed and calculated at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) over a long period, and the latest available were adopted for the ephemerides in the [[Astronomical Almanac]] starting in 1984. Although not an IAU standard, the ephemeris time argument T<sub>eph</sub> has been in use at that institution since the 1960s. The time scale represented by T<sub>eph</sub> has been characterized as a [[principle of relativity|relativistic]] coordinate time that differs from [[Terrestrial Time]] only by small periodic terms with an amplitude not exceeding 2 milliseconds of time: it is linearly related to, but distinct (by an offset and constant rate which is of the order of 0.5&nbsp;s/a) from the [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]] time scale adopted in 1991 as a standard by the [[IAU]]. Thus for clocks on or near the [[geoid]], T<sub>eph</sub> (within 2 milliseconds), but not so closely TCB, can be used as approximations to Terrestrial Time, and via the standard ephemerides T<sub>eph</sub> is in widespread use.<ref name=\"EMS1998\"/>\n\nPartly in acknowledgement of the widespread use of T<sub>eph</sub> via the JPL ephemerides, IAU resolution 3 of 2006<ref>[http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2006_Resol3.pdf IAU 2006 resolution 3]</ref> (re-)defined [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]] (TDB) as a current standard. As re-defined in 2006, TDB is a linear transformation of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]]. The same IAU resolution also stated (in note 4) that the \"independent time argument of the JPL ephemeris [[DE405]], which is called T<sub>eph</sub>\" (here the IAU source cites<ref name=\"EMS1998\"/>), \"is for practical purposes the same as [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]] defined in this Resolution\". Thus the new TDB, like T<sub>eph</sub>, is essentially a more refined continuation of the older ephemeris time ET and (apart from the {{nowrap|< 2 ms}} periodic fluctuations) has the same mean rate as that established for ET in the 1950s.\n\n==Use in official almanacs and ephemerides==\nEphemeris time based on the standard adopted in 1952 was introduced into the Astronomical Ephemeris (UK) and the [[American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac]], replacing UT in the main ephemerides in the issues for 1960 and after.<ref>[[#refESAA|ESAA 1992]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&pg=PA612 at p.612].</ref>  (But the ephemerides in the Nautical Almanac, by then a separate publication for the use of navigators, continued to be expressed in terms of UT.)  The ephemerides continued on this basis through 1983 (with some changes due to adoption of improved values of astronomical constants), after which, for 1984 onwards, they adopted the [[JPL]] ephemerides.\n\nPrevious to the 1960 change, the 'Improved Lunar Ephemeris' had already been made available in terms of ephemeris time for the years 1952-1959<ref>\"Improved Lunar Ephemeris\", US Government Printing Office, 1954.</ref> (computed by [[Wallace John Eckert|W J Eckert]] from [[Ernest William Brown|Brown]]'s theory with modifications recommended by Clemence (1948)).\n\n==Redefinition of the second==\nSuccessive definitions of the unit of ephemeris time are mentioned above ([[#History of ephemeris time (1952 standard)|History]]).  The value adopted for the 1956/1960 standard second:\n\n:the fraction 1/31 556 925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 [[January 0]] at 12 hours ephemeris time.\n\nwas obtained from the linear time-coefficient in Newcomb's expression for the solar mean longitude (above), taken and applied with the same meaning for the time as in formula (3) above.  The relation with Newcomb's coefficient can be seen from:\n\n:1/31 556 925.9747 = 129 602 768.13 / (360&times;60&times;60&times;36 525&times;86 400).\n\n[[Caesium]] [[atomic clocks]] became operational in 1955, and quickly confirmed the evidence that the rotation of the earth fluctuated randomly.  This confirmed the unsuitability of the mean solar second of Universal Time as a measure of time interval for the most precise purposes.  After three years of comparisons with lunar observations, [[William Markowitz|Markowitz]] et al. (1958) determined that the ephemeris second corresponded to 9 192 631 770 \u00b1 20 cycles of the chosen cesium resonance.<ref name=Mark1958>[[#refMark1958|W Markowitz, R G Hall, L Essen, J V L Parry (1958)]]</ref>\n\nFollowing this, in 1967/68, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) replaced the definition of the [[Second#International second|SI second]] by the following:\n<blockquote>The second is the duration of 9&thinsp;192&thinsp;631&thinsp;770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.\n</blockquote>\nAlthough this is an independent definition that does not refer to the older basis of ephemeris time, it uses the same quantity as the value of the ephemeris second measured by the cesium clock in 1958.  This [[Second#International second|SI second referred to atomic time]] was later verified by Markowitz (1988) to be in agreement, within 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup>, with the second of ephemeris time as determined from lunar observations.<ref name=\"refMark1988\"/>\n\nFor practical purposes the length of the ephemeris second can be taken as equal to the length of the second of [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)]] or [[Terrestrial Time|Terrestrial Time (TT)]] or its predecessor TDT.\n\nThe difference between ET and UT is called [[\u0394T]]; it changes irregularly, but the long-term trend is [[parabola|parabolic]], decreasing from ancient times until the nineteenth century,<ref name=morr3 /> and increasing since then at a rate corresponding to an increase in the solar day length of 1.7&nbsp;ms per century (see [[leap second]]s).\n\n[[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) was set equal to [[Universal Time|UT2]] at 1 January 1958 0:00:00 .  At that time, \u0394T was already about 32.18 seconds.  The difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) (the successor to ephemeris time) and atomic time was later defined as follows:\n\n:1977 January 1.000 3725 TT = 1977 January 1.000 0000 TAI, ''i.e.''\n\n:TT \u2212 TAI = 32.184 seconds\n\nThis difference may be assumed constant\u2014the rates of TT and TAI are designed to be identical.\n\n==Notes and references==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n<!-- *<cite id=dum1> --><!-- needed for redirect to 1st real item to work ok--> <!-- </cite> -->\n\n*<cite id=refClem1948>[[Gerald Maurice Clemence|G M Clemence]], [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1948AJ.....53..169C \"On the System of Astronomical Constants\"], ''Astronomical Journal'', vol.53(6) (1948), issue #1170, pp 169\u2013179.</cite>\n*<cite id=refClem1971>[[Gerald Maurice Clemence|G M Clemence]] (1971), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1971JHA.....2...73C \"The Concept of Ephemeris Time\"], ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', vol.2 (1971), pp. 73\u201379.</cite>\n*<cite id=refGuin1988>B Guinot and P K Seidelmann (1988), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988A%26A...194..304G \"Time scales \u2013 Their history, definition and interpretation\"], ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', vol. 194 (nos. 1\u20132) (April 1988), pp.304\u2013308.</cite>\n*<cite id=refESAA>'ESAA (1992)': P K Seidelmann (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C \"Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac\"], University Science Books, CA, 1992 ; {{ISBN|0-935702-68-7}}.</cite>\n*<cite id=refESAE>'ESAE 1961': \"Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\" ('prepared jointly by the Nautical Almanac Offices of the United Kingdom and the United States of America', HMSO, London, 1961).</cite>\n*<cite id=refIAU1976>[[IAU]] resolutions (1976): [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf Resolutions adopted by the IAU in 1976 at Grenoble].</cite>\n*<cite id=refILE>\"Improved Lunar Ephemeris\", US Government Printing Office, 1954.</cite>\n*<cite id=refMark1955>[[William Markowitz|W Markowitz]], R G Hall, S Edelson (1955), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1955AJ.....60R.171M \"Ephemeris time from photographic positions of the moon\"], ''Astronomical Journal'', vol. 60 (1955), p.171.</cite>\n*<cite id=refMark1958>[[William Markowitz|W Markowitz]], R G Hall, L Essen, J V L Parry (1958), [http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf \"Frequency of cesium in terms of ephemeris time\"], Physical Review Letters, vol.1 (1958), 105\u2013107.</cite>\n*<cite id=refMark1959>[[William Markowitz|W Markowitz]] (1959), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1959AJ.....64..106M \"Variations in the Rotation of the Earth, Results Obtained with the Dual-Rate Moon Camera and Photographic Zenith Tubes\"], ''Astronomical Journal'', vol.64 (1959), pp. 106\u2013113.</cite>\n*<cite id=refMark1988>[[William Markowitz|Wm Markowitz]] (1988), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1988IAUS..128..413M \"Comparisons of ET(Solar), ET(Lunar), UT and TDT\"], in A K Babcock & G A Wilkins (eds.), ''The Earth's Rotation and Reference Frames for Geodesy and Geophysics'', IAU Symposia #128 (1988), pp 413\u2013418.</cite>\n*<cite id=tr32-1306>W G Melbourne, J D Mulholland, W L Sjogren, F M Sturms (1968), \"Constants and Related Information for Astrodynamic Calculations\", NASA Technical Report 32-1306, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, July 15, 1968.</cite>\n*<cite id=morrste2004>L V Morrison, F R Stephenson (2004), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004JHA....35..327M \"Historical values of the Earth's clock error &Delta;T and the calculation of eclipses\"],  ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' ({{ISSN|0021-8286}}), vol. 35(3) (2004), #120, pp. 327\u2013336 (with addendum at [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005JHA....36..339M vol.36, p.339]).</cite>\n*<cite id=refNewcSun>[[Simon Newcomb]] (1895), ''[[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|Tables of the Sun]]'' (\"Tables of the Motion of the Earth on its Axis and Around the Sun\", in \"Tables of the Four Inner Planets\", vol. 6, part 1, of ''Astronomical Papers prepared for the use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' (1895), at pages 1\u2013169).</cite>\n*<cite id=refSitter1927>[[Willem de Sitter|W de Sitter]] (1927), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1927BAN.....4...21D \"On the secular accelerations and the fluctuations of the longitudes of the moon, the sun, Mercury and Venus\"], ''Bull.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life.

Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring \"flash, trash, and melodrama\" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name=\"20years\" />\n\nOnce they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC.

This theme encompasses the whole Square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator [[Tony Holland]] was from a large East End family, and such families have typified ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"Insidestory p49\" /> The first central family was the combination of the [[Fowler family]], consisting of [[Pauline Fowler]], her husband [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]], and teenage children [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] and [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]]. Pauline's family, the [[Beale family|Beales]], consisted of Pauline's twin brother [[Pete Beale]], his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] and their teenage son [[Ian Beale|Ian]]. Pauline and Pete's domineering mother [[Lou Beale]] lived with Pauline and her family.

The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female Slater clan, before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the [[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carters]]. The Beales are the show's longest running family, having been in ''EastEnders'' since it began in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Key people involved in the production of ''EastEnders'' have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.<ref name=\"Insidestory p49\" /> [[Peggy Mitchell]], in particular, is notorious for her ceaseless repetition of such statements as \"You're a Mitchell!\" and \"It's all about family!\" Pauline Fowler is also known for her insistence on family and mentioning her brother and husband to instill loyalty from family members. Her mother Lou Beale is renowned for her family meetings and traditional approach to family. More recently, [[Derek Branning]] regularly expresses the importance of a strong family unit. As the eldest sibling, he is constantly asserting his position as head of his family and reminding everyone to pull together in times of trouble. Additionally, Derek commonly refers to himself, [[Max Branning]] and [[Jack Branning]] as \"the Branning brothers.\"\n\n''EastEnders'' has an emphasis on strong family [[matriarch]]s, with examples including [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Peggy Mitchell]], helping to attract a female audience. [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]], then the BBC's head of drama production, put this down to Tony Holland's \"gay sensibility, which showed a love for strong women\".<ref name=\"Lifeblood\" /> The matriarchal role is one that has been seen in various reincarnations since the programme's inception, often depicted as the centre of the family unit.<ref name=\"20years p55\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=55}}</ref> The original matriarch was Lou Beale, though later examples include [[Mo Harris]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/eastenders/|title=EastEnders|last=Dougan|first=John|date=19 August 2002|website=PopMatters|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Pat Butcher]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/entertainment/eastenders-matriarch-for-xmas-exit-525722.html|title='EastEnders' matriarch for Xmas exit|date=25 October 2011|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Zainab Masood]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2248900/Nina-Wadia-quits-EastEnders-years-playing-Zainab-Masood.html|title=Nina Wadia quits EastEnders after five years of playing Zainab Masood|last=Sanders|first=Louise|date=16 December 2012|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=18 January 2013|location=London}}</ref> and [[Cora Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood |title=Exclusive: Q&A with Bryan Kirkwood |date=20 June 2011 |publisher=Walford Web |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930053732/http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood |archivedate=30 September 2012 }}</ref> These characters are seen as being loud and interfering but most importantly, responsible for the well-being of the family<ref name=\"redpepper\" /> and usually stressing the importance of family, reflecting on the past.\n\nThe show often includes strong, brassy, long-suffering women who exhibit [[diva]]-like behaviour and stoically battle through an array of tragedy and misfortune.<ref name=\"redpepper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archivedate=29 December 2006 |title=Square deal|publisher=Redpepper|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> Such characters include [[Angie Watts]], [[Kathy Beale]], [[Sharon Watts]], Pat Butcher, [[Denise Fox]] and [[Tanya Branning]].

For its 25th anniversary in February 2010, a [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] was broadcast in which [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) was revealed as [[Archie Mitchell]]'s ([[Larry Lamb]]) killer. Turner was told only 30&nbsp;minutes before the live episode and to maintain suspense, she whispers this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found out at the same time as the public, when the episode was broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a177337/live-ep-for-eastenders-25th-anniversary/|title=Live ep for 'EastEnders' 25th anniversary|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> On 23 July 2012, a segment of [[Episode 4466|that evening's episode]] was screened live as [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) carried the [[Olympic Flame]] around Walford in preparation for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nickie |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/11/the-olympic-flame-comes-to-wal.shtml |title=EastEnders: The Olympic flame comes to Walford! |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> In February 2015, for the soap's 30th anniversary, [[EastEnders Live Week|five episodes in a week]] featured live inserts throughout them.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name=\"First10Years p143\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

Since 2001, it has been broadcast at 7:30{{nbsp}}pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 8{{nbsp}}pm on Monday and Friday. ''EastEnders'' was originally broadcast twice weekly at 7:00{{nbsp}}pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 19 February 1985. However, in September 1985 the two episodes were moved to 7:30{{nbsp}}pm as [[Michael Grade]] did not want the soap running in direct competition with ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]'', and this remained the same until 7 April 1994. The BBC had originally planned to take advantage of the 'summer break' that ''Emmerdale Farm'' usually took to capitalise on ratings, but [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV1]] added extra episodes and repeats so that ''Emmerdale Farm'' was not taken off the air over the summer. Realising the futility of the situation, Grade decided to move the show to the later 7:30{{nbsp}}pm slot, but to avoid tabloid speculation that it was a \"panic move\" on the BBC's behalf, they had to \"dress up the presentation of that move in such a way as to protect the show\" giving \"all kinds of reasons\" for the move.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n''EastEnders'' output then increased to three times a week on Mondays, Tuesday and Thursdays from 11 April 1994 until 2 August 2001.<ref name=\"edures\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/howcani/howcani_content/howcani_0011.shtml |title= Educational resource (part one) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403175032/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/howcani/howcani_content/howcani_0011.shtml |archivedate=3 April 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\nFrom 10 August 2001, ''EastEnders'' then added its fourth episode (shown on Fridays).<ref name=\"edures\" /> This caused some controversy as it clashed with ''[[Coronation Street]]'', which at the time was moved to 8{{nbsp}}pm to make way for an hour-long episode of rural soap ''Emmerdale'' at 7{{nbsp}}pm.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Morgan]] and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]]. As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

It has frequently been referred to in many different media, including songs and television programmes.\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{further information|EastEnders books}}\nMany books have been written about ''EastEnders''. Notably, from 1985 to 1988, author and television writer Hugh Miller wrote 17 novels, detailing the lives of many of the show's original characters before 1985, when events on screen took place.\n\nKate Lock also wrote four novels centred on more recent characters; [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]], [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], [[Bianca Jackson]] and [[Tiffany Mitchell]]. Lock also wrote a character guide entitled ''Who's Who in EastEnders'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-55178-2}}) in 2000, examining main characters from the first 15 years of the show.\n\nShow creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland also wrote a book about the show in 1987, entitled ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-20601-9}}), telling the story of how the show made it to screen. Two special anniversary books have been written about the show; ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-37057-4}}) by Colin Brake in 1995 and ''EastEnders: 20 Years in

[[Akhaltsikhe]].]]\n\n'''Embroidery''' is the [[craft]] of decorating [[Textile|fabric]] or other materials using a [[sewing needle|needle]] to apply [[yarn|thread or yarn]].\n\nEmbroidery may also incorporate other materials such as [[pearl]]s, [[bead]]s, [[quill]]s, and  [[sequin]]s. In modern days, embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, and [[golf shirt]]s. Embroidery is available with a wide variety of [[yarn|thread or yarn]] color.\n\nSome of the basic techniques or [[Embroidery stitch|stitches]] of the earliest embroidery are [[chain stitch]], [[buttonhole stitch|buttonhole or blanket stitch]], [[running stitch]], [[satin stitch]], [[cross stitch]]. Those stitches remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kazakh rug chain stitch embroidery.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional embroidery in chain stitch on a [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] rug, contemporary.]]\n[[File:17.17-37-1969-Kaukasisk-broderi.jpg|thumbnail|[[Caucasus|Caucasian]] embroidery]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe process used to tailor, patch, mend and reinforce cloth fostered the development of sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led to the art of embroidery.<ref>Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 12</ref> Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:\n\n{{blockquote|It is a striking fact that in the development of embroidery ... there are no changes of materials or techniques which can be felt or interpreted as advances from a primitive to a later, more refined stage. On the other hand, we often find in early works a technical accomplishment and high standard of craftsmanship rarely attained in later times.<ref>Marie Schuette and Sigrid Muller-Christensen, ''The Art of Embroidery'' translated by Donald King, Thames and Hudson, 1964, quoted in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, p. 2</ref>}}\n\nThe art of embroidery has been found worldwide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the [[Warring States period]] (5th\u20133rd century BC).<ref>Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 178</ref> In a garment from [[Migration period]] Sweden, roughly 300\u2013700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whip-stitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.<ref name=\"Coatsworth\">Coatsworth, Elizabeth: \"Stitches in Time: Establishing a History of Anglo-Saxon Embroidery\", in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, p. 2</ref>\n\nAncient [[Greek mythology]] has credited the goddess [[Athena]] with passing down the art of embroidery along with [[weaving]], leading to the famed competition between herself and the mortal [[Arachne]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Art of Embroidery: History of Style and Technique|last=Synge|first=Lanto|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=2001|isbn=9781851493593|location=Woodbridge, England|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical applications and techniques ===\nDepending on time, location and materials available, embroidery could be the domain of a few experts or a widespread, popular technique. This flexibility led to a variety of works, from the royal to the mundane.\n\nElaborately embroidered clothing, religious objects, and household items often were seen as a mark of wealth and status, as in the case of [[Opus Anglicanum]], a technique used by professional workshops and guilds in medieval [[England]].<ref>Levey and King 1993, p. 12</ref> In 18th-century England and its colonies, samplers employing fine silks were produced by the daughters of wealthy families.

Examples include [[Hardanger]] from Norway, [[Drawn thread work#Poltava-style drawnwork|Merezhka]]  from [[Ukraine]], [[Mountmellick embroidery]] from Ireland,  [[Nakshi kantha]] from [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], and [[Brazilian embroidery]].

The 17th-century [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] called it the \"craft of the two hands\". Because embroidery was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it became widely popular. In cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]], embroidery was visible on [[handkerchief]]s, uniforms, flags, [[calligraphy]], shoes, [[robe]]s, tunics, horse trappings, slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on [[leather]] [[Belt (clothing)|belts]]. Craftsmen embroidered items with [[gold]] and [[silver]] thread. Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.skill.of.the.two.hands.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :The Skill of the Two Hands|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, in the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], his chronicler [[Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] wrote in the famous [[Ain-i-Akbari]]:\n\"His majesty (Akbar) pays much attention to various stuffs; hence [[Iran]]i, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Mongolia]]n articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of ''Nakshi'', ''Saadi'', ''Chikhan'', ''Ari'', ''Zardozi'', ''Wastli'', ''Gota'' and ''Kohra''. The imperial workshops in the towns of [[Lahore]], [[Agra]], [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur]] and [[Ahmedabad]] turn out many masterpieces of workmanship in fabrics, and the figures and patterns, knots and variety of fashions which now prevail astonish even the most experienced travelers.

Contemporary.]]\nEmbroidery can be classified according to what degree the design takes into account the nature of the base material and by the relationship of stitch placement to the fabric. The main categories are free or surface embroidery, counted embroidery, and needlepoint or canvas work.<ref>{{ cite web|url =http://www.needlenthread.com/2016/10/needlework-terminology-surface-embroidery.html|title =Needlework Terminology: Surface Embroidery|last =Corbet|first =Mary|date =October 3, 2016|access-date =November 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn free or surface embroidery, designs are applied without regard to the weave of the underlying fabric.  Examples include [[crewel embroidery|crewel]] and traditional Chinese and Japanese embroidery.\n\n[[Counted-thread embroidery]] patterns are created by making stitches over a predetermined number of threads in the foundation fabric. Counted-thread embroidery is more easily worked on an [[even-weave]] foundation fabric such as embroidery [[canvas]], [[aida cloth]], or specially woven [[cotton]] and [[linen]] fabrics . Examples include [[cross-stitch]] and some forms of [[blackwork embroidery]].\n\nWhile similar to counted thread in regards to technique, in [[canvas work]] or [[needlepoint]], threads are stitched through a fabric mesh to create a dense pattern that completely covers the foundation fabric.<ref>Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 198</ref> Examples of canvas work include [[Bargello (needlework)|bargello]] and [[Berlin wool work]].\n\nEmbroidery can also be classified by the similarity of appearance. In [[drawn thread work]] and [[cutwork]], the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in the same color as the foundation fabric. When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as [[whitework]].<ref>Readers Digest 1979, pp. 74\u201391</ref> However, whitework can either be counted or free. [[Hardanger embroidery]] is a counted embroidery and the designs are often geometric.<ref>{{cite book|author= Yvette Stanton|title= Early Style Hardanger|publisher=Vetty Creations|isbn=978-0-9757677-7-1}}</ref> Conversely, styles such as [[Broderie anglaise]] are similar to free embroidery, with floral or abstract designs that are not dependent on the weave of the fabric.<ref>{{cite book|author=Catherine Amoroso Leslie|title=Needlework Through History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEiGeSLKLjMC&pg=PA58|accessdate=13 September 2013|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33548-8|pages=34, 226, 58}}</ref>\n[[File:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|thumb|Tea-cloth, [[Hungary]], mid-20th century]]\n\n== Materials ==\n[[File:Patiala Phulkari.jpg|thumb| [[Phulkari]] from the [[Punjab region]] of India.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], 11th century.]]\n\nThe fabrics and yarns used in traditional embroidery vary from place to place. [[Wool]], [[linen]], and [[silk]] have been in use for thousands of years for both fabric and yarn. Today, [[embroidery thread]] is manufactured in [[cotton]], [[rayon]], and [[novelty yarn]]s as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk.  [[Ribbon]] embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/[[organza]] blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.<ref>van Niekerk 2006</ref>\n\nSurface embroidery techniques such as chain stitch and [[couching]] or laid-work are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for [[Goldwork (embroidery)|goldwork]]. Canvas work techniques, in which large amounts of yarn are buried on the back of the work, use more materials but provide a sturdier and more substantial finished textile.<ref name=\"RDCW\">Readers Digest 1979, pp. 112\u2013115</ref>\n\nIn both canvas work and surface embroidery an [[embroidery hoop]] or frame can be used to stretch the material and ensure even stitching tension that prevents pattern distortion. Modern canvas work tends to follow symmetrical counted stitching patterns with designs emerging from the repetition of one or just a few similar stitches in a variety of hues. In contrast, many forms of surface embroidery make use of a wide range of stitching patterns in a single piece of work.<ref>Readers Digest 1979, pp. 1\u201319, 112\u2013117</ref>\n\n== Machine ==\n[[File:Machine chain stitch.jpg|right|thumb|Commercial machine embroidery in [[chain stitch]] on a [[voile]] curtain, China, early 21st century.]]\n\nContemporary embroidery is stitched with a [[computer]]ized embroidery machine using patterns digitized with [[embroidery software]]. In [[machine embroidery]], different types of \"fills\" add texture and design to the finished work. [[Machine embroidery]] is used to add [[logo]]s and [[monogram]]s to business shirts or jackets, gifts, and team apparel as well as to decorate household linens, draperies, and decorator fabrics that mimic the elaborate hand embroidery of the past.\n\nThere has also been a development in free hand machine embroidery, new machines have been designed that allow for the user to create free-motion embroidery which has its place in textile arts, quilting, dressmaking, home furnishings and more.<ref>{{cite web |title=Using logo embroidery|url=http://www.schilder-pixner.at/stickerei/ |publisher=Oekaki Renaissance |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> Users can use the embroidery software to digitize the digital embroidery designs.

Like other Tonalists, his style and predominantly [[pastoral]] subject matter were drawn from his admiration for [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]] and the French [[Barbizon School]].\n\n[[File:2011.1.5 PS6.jpg|thumb|Edward Mitchell Bannister (American, 1828-1901). ''Untitled'', ca. 1885. Brooklyn Museum, 2011.]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Edward Mitchell Bannister - Landscape - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Landscape]]\nBannister was born in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick]] and moved to [[New England]] in the late 1840s, where he remained for the rest of his life. Bannister was well known in the artistic community of his adopted home of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and admired within the wider East Coast art world: he won a [[bronze medal]] for his large oil \"Under the Oaks\" at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia Centennial]]. But he was largely forgotten for almost a century for various reasons, principally [[Racism|racial prejudice]]. Bannister began his official career as an artist when an article in the 1867 ''[[New York Herald]]'' belittled both him and his work, stating \"... ''the negro has an appreciation for art while being manifestly unable to produce it''.\" Prior to working as a painter, Bannister worked as barber and [[Tinted photograph|tinted photos]]. In the late 1850s he attended lectures given by D. William Rimmer, a sculptor noted for his accuracy in rendering the human figure. Over the course of his career, Bannister was inspired by the [[Barbizon school]]-inspired paintings of [[William Morris Hunt]] who had studied in Europe and held numerous public exhibitions in Boston around the 1860s.\n\nWith the ascendency of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1970s, his work was again celebrated and collected. In 1978, [[Rhode Island College]] dedicated its Art Gallery in Bannister's name with the exhibition: \"Four From Providence ~ Alston, Bannister, Jennings & Prophet\". This event was attended and commented on by numerous notable political figures of the time, and supported by the Rhode Island Committee for Humanities and the [[Rhode Island Historical Society]]. Events like this, across the entire cultural landscape, have ensured that his artwork and life will not be again forgotten. Although committed to freedom and equal rights for [[African Americans|Afro-Americans]], he chose not to inject those issues into his work, adopting instead a spiritual philosophy and individually expressive style which represented harmony and liberty on a more universal plane.\n\nAlthough primarily known for his idealised [[Landscape art|landscapes]] and [[seascapes]], Bannister also executed [[portrait]]s, biblical and mythological scenes, and [[Genre works|genre]] scenes. An intellectual [[autodidacticism|autodidact]], his tastes in literature were typical of an educated [[Victorian era|Victorian]] painter, including [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[Virgil]], [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], from whose works much of his iconography can be traced. His work was stunning, oftentimes reflecting the composition, mood, and influences of French Barbizon painters [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny]]. He had an affinity for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] thought which was reflected in the spirituality of his work. Progressively his understanding for color/color mixing improved and the quality of work increased, really digging into naturalistic territory.\n\nBannister died of a heart attack in 1901 while attending a prayer meeting at his church, Elmwood Avenue Free Baptist Church. He is buried in the [[North Burial Ground]] in Providence.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe historian Anne Louise Avery is currently compiling the first [[Catalogue raisonn\u00e9|Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9]] and major biography of Bannister's work. See the [http://ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research] for further details.\n\nE. M. Bannister Gallery at [[Rhode Island College]] is named after Bannister.<ref name= \"gallbio\">{{cite news |last= |first= |url= http://www.ric.edu/bannister/about_emb.php |title=Edward Mitchell Bannister |work=[[Rhode Island College]] |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}</ref>\n\nAs his career matured, Banister accumulated many honors, several from the [[Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association|Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association]]. His two biggest support systems were his mother, who was the catalyst from the very beginning for his passion for the arts, and his wife, who also was an activist. Both strong supporters of [[Abolitionism|abolition]], wife Christina lobbied for equal pay for black soldiers during the Civil War and also organized the soldiers\u2019 relief fair in 1864. In 1880 a group of professional artists, amateurs, and art collectors founded the [[Providence Art Club]] to stimulate the appreciation of art in the community, one of those people was Edward Mitchell Bannister. Bannister was the only major African American artist of the late nineteenth century who developed his talents without the benefit of European exposure,\n\n==House==\nThe house at 93 Benevolent Street in Providence, where Bannister lived between 1884 and 1899, was owned by [[Brown University]] until 2016.

[[Hans Eysenck|H. J.

His theories dominated psychiatry at the start of the 20th century and, despite the later [[psychodynamic]] influence of [[Sigmund Freud]] and his disciples, enjoyed a revival at century's end.  While he proclaimed his own high clinical standards of gathering information \"by means of expert analysis of individual cases\", he also drew on reported observations of officials not trained in psychiatry.

In it, he argued that psychiatry was a branch of medical science and should be investigated by observation and experimentation like the other natural sciences. He called for research into the physical causes of mental illness, and started to establish the foundations of the modern classification system for mental disorders. Kraepelin proposed that by studying case histories and identifying specific disorders, the progression of mental illness could be predicted, after taking into account individual differences in personality and patient age at the onset of disease.<ref name=Alic2001/>\n\nIn 1884 he became senior physician in the Prussian provincial town of [[Leubus]], [[Silesia Province]], and the following year he was appointed director of the Treatment and Nursing Institute in [[Dresden]].

He rejected psychoanalytical theories that posited innate or early sexuality as the cause of mental illness, and he rejected philosophical speculation as unscientific. He focused on collecting clinical data and was particularly interested in [[neuropathology]] (e.g., diseased tissue).<ref name=Alic2001/>\n\nIn the later period of his career, as a convinced champion of [[social Darwinism]], he actively promoted a policy and research agenda in racial hygiene and eugenics.<ref name=Engstrom2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Engstrom EJ, Weber MM, Burgmair W |title=Emil Wilhelm Magnus Georg Kraepelin (1856\u20131926)|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97097|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=October 2006|volume=163|issue=10|pages=1710|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.10.1710|pmid=17012678}}.</ref>\n\nKraepelin retired from teaching at the age of 66, spending his remaining years establishing the Institute.

This turned out to be his paradigm-setting synthesis of the hundreds of mental disorders classified by the 19th century, grouping diseases together based on classification of [[syndrome]]\u2014common ''patterns'' of symptoms over time\u2014rather than by simple similarity of major symptoms in the manner of his predecessors. Kraepelin described his work in the 5th edition of his textbook as a \"decisive step from a symptomatic to a clinical view of insanity. . . . The importance of external clinical signs has . . . been subordinated to consideration of the conditions of origin, the course, and the terminus which result from individual disorders. Thus, all purely symptomatic categories have disappeared from the nosology\".<ref name=decker/>\n\n=== Psychosis and mood ===\nKraepelin is specifically credited with the classification of what was previously considered to be a [[Unitary psychosis|unitary concept of psychosis]], into two distinct forms (known as the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]]):\n\n* [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]] (now seen as comprising a range of mood disorders such as [[clinical depression|recurrent major depression]] and [[bipolar disorder]]), and\n* [[dementia praecox]].\n\nDrawing on his long-term research, and using the criteria of course, outcome and prognosis, he developed the concept of [[dementia praecox]], which he defined as the \"sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age\".  When he first introduced this concept as a diagnostic entity in the fourth German edition of his ''Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie'' in 1893, it was placed among the degenerative disorders alongside, but separate from, [[catatonia]] and [[dementia paranoides]]. At that time, the concept corresponded by and large with [[Ewald Hecker]]'s [[hebephrenia]]. In the sixth edition of the ''Lehrbuch'' in 1899 all three of these clinical types are treated as different expressions of one disease, dementia praecox.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained a Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the cardinal principles of his method was the recognition that any given symptom may appear in virtually any one of these disorders; e.g., there is almost no single symptom occurring in dementia praecox which cannot sometimes be found in manic depression. What distinguishes each disease symptomatically (as opposed to the underlying pathology) is not any particular (pathognomonic) symptom or symptoms, but a specific pattern of symptoms. In the absence of a direct physiological or genetic test or marker for each disease, it is only possible to distinguish them by their specific pattern of symptoms. Thus, Kraepelin's system is a method for pattern recognition, not grouping by common symptoms.\n\nKraepelin also demonstrated specific patterns in the genetics of these disorders and specific and characteristic patterns in their course and outcome.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebert|first1=Andreas|title=Emil Kraepelin: A pioneer of scientific understanding of psychiatry and psychopharmacology|journal=US National Library of Medicine|date=April 2010|issue=Apr/Jun 2010|pages=191\u2013192|pmc=2927892|accessdate=|pmid=20838510|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.64591|volume=52}}</ref> Generally speaking, there tend to be more schizophrenics among the relatives of schizophrenic patients than in the general population, while manic depression is more frequent in the relatives of manic depressives. Though, of course, this does not demonstrate genetic linkage, as this might be a socio-environmental factor as well.\n\nHe also reported a pattern to the course and outcome of these conditions. Kraepelin believed that schizophrenia had a deteriorating course in which mental function continuously (although perhaps erratically) declines, while manic-depressive patients experienced a course of illness which was intermittent, where patients were relatively symptom-free during the intervals which separate acute episodes. This led Kraepelin to name what we now know as schizophrenia, dementia praecox (the [[dementia]] part signifying the irreversible mental decline). It later became clear that dementia praecox did not necessarily lead to mental decline and was thus renamed [[schizophrenia]] by [[Eugen Bleuler]] to correct Kraepelin's misnomer.\n\nIn addition, as Kraepelin accepted in 1920, \"It is becoming increasingly obvious that we cannot satisfactorily distinguish these two diseases\"; however, he maintained that \"On the one hand we find those patients with irreversible dementia and severe cortical lesions. On the other are those patients whose personality remains intact\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berrios GE, Luque R, Villagran JM | year = 2003 | title = Schizophrenia: a conceptual history | url = http://www.ijpsy.com/volumen3/num2/60/schizophrenia-a-conceptual-history-esquizofrenia-EN.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111\u2013140 }}</ref> Nevertheless, overlap between the diagnoses and neurological abnormalities (when found) have continued, and in fact a diagnostic category of [[schizoaffective disorder]] would be brought in to cover the intermediate cases.\n\nKraepelin devoted very few pages to his speculations about the etiology of his two major insanities, dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity. However, from 1896 to his death in 1926 he held to the speculation that these insanities (particularly dementia praecox) would one day probably be found to be caused by a gradual systemic or \"whole body\" disease process, probably metabolic, which affected many of the organs and nerves in the body but affected the brain in a final, decisive cascade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Noll|first=Richard|title=Whole Body Madness|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/2104852|publisher=Psychiatric Times|accessdate=26 September 2012}}.</ref>\n\n=== Psychopathic personalities ===\nIn the first through sixth edition of Kraepelin's influential psychiatry textbook, there was a section on [[moral insanity]], which meant then a disorder of the emotions or moral sense without apparent delusions or hallucinations, and which Kraepelin defined as \"lack or weakness of those sentiments which counter the ruthless satisfaction of egotism\". He attributed this mainly to degeneration. This has been described as a psychiatric redefinition of [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s theories of the \"born criminal\", conceptualised as a \"[[moral]] defect\", though Kraepelin stressed it was not yet possible to recognise them by physical characteristics.<ref name=Wetzell2000>Richard F. Wetzell (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGW7QLJmuwoC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Inventing the criminal: a history of German criminology, 1880\u20131945] from p 59 & 146, misc.</ref>\n\nIn fact from 1904 Kraepelin changed the section heading to \"The born criminal\", moving it from under \"Congenital feeble-mindedness\" to a new chapter on \"Psychopathic personalities\". They were treated under a theory of degeneration. Four types were distinguished: born criminals (inborn delinquents), [[pathological liars]], [[querulous]] persons, and Triebmenschen (persons driven by a basic compulsion, including [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], [[spendthrifts]], and [[dipsomaniacs]]). The concept of \"[[psychopathic]] inferiorities\" had been recently popularised in Germany by [[Julius Ludwig August Koch]], who proposed congenital and acquired types. Kraepelin had no evidence or explanation suggesting a congenital cause, and his assumption therefore appears to have been simple \"[[biologism]]\". Others, such as [[Gustav Aschaffenburg]], argued for a varying combination of causes. Kraepelin's assumption of a moral defect rather than a positive drive towards crime has also been questioned, as it implies that the moral sense is somehow inborn and unvarying, yet it was known to vary by time and place, and Kraepelin never considered that the moral sense might just be different. [[Kurt Schneider]] criticized Kraepelin's nosology for appearing to be a list of behaviors that he considered undesirable, rather than medical conditions, though Schneider's alternative version has also been criticised on the same basis. Nevertheless, many essentials of these diagnostic systems were introduced into the diagnostic systems, and remarkable similarities remain in the DSM-IV and ICD-10.<ref name=Wetzell2000/> The issues would today mainly be considered under the category of [[personality disorders]], or in terms of Kraepelin's focus on [[psychopathy]].\n\nKraepelin had referred to psychopathic conditions (or \"states\") in his 1896 edition, including compulsive insanity, impulsive insanity, [[homosexuality]], and mood disturbances. From 1904, however, he instead termed those \"original disease conditions, and introduced the new alternative category of psychopathic personalities. In the eighth edition from 1909 that category would include, in addition to a separate \"dissocial\" type, the excitable, the unstable, the Triebmenschen driven persons, eccentrics, the liars and swindlers, and the quarrelsome. It has been described as remarkable that Kraepelin now considered mood disturbances to be not part of the same category, but only attenuated (more mild) phases of manic depressive illness; this corresponds to current classification schemes.<ref>Henning Sass & Alan Felthous (2008) Chapter 1: History and Conceptual Development of Psychopathic Disorders in [https://books.google.com/books?id=8WhcGo-1MkYC&dq=kurt+schneider+psychopaths&source=gbs_navlinks_s International Handbook on Psychopathic Disorders and the Law].

Kraepelin was confident that it would someday be possible to identify the pathological basis of each of the major psychiatric disorders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Eugenics ===\nUpon moving to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the [[University of Munich]] in 1903, Kraepelin increasingly wrote on social policy issues.

He appears to have held [[Lamarckian]] concepts of evolution, such that cultural deterioration could be inherited. He was a strong ally and promoter of the work of fellow psychiatrist (and pupil and later successor as director of the clinic) [[Ernst R\u00fcdin]] to clarify the mechanisms of genetic inheritance as to make a so-called \"[[empirical]] genetic [[prognosis]]\".<ref name=Engstrom2007/>\n\nMartin Brune has pointed out that Kraepelin and R\u00fcdin also appear to have been ardent advocates of a [[self-domestication]] theory, a version of [[social Darwinism]] which held that modern culture was not allowing people to be weeded out, resulting in more mental disorder and deterioration of the gene pool. Kraepelin saw a number of \"symptoms\" of this, such as \"weakening of viability and resistance, decreasing fertility, proletarianisation, and moral damage due to \"penning up people\" [''Zusammenpferchung'']. He also wrote that \"the number of idiots, epileptics, psychopaths, criminals, prostitutes, and tramps who descend from alcoholic and syphilitic parents, and who transfer their inferiority to their offspring, is incalculable\". He felt that \"the well-known example of the [[Jews]], with their strong disposition towards nervous and mental disorders, teaches us that their extraordinarily advanced domestication may eventually imprint clear marks on the race\". Brune states that Kraepelin's [[nosological]] system was \"to a great deal, built on the degeneration [[paradigm]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Br\u00fcne|first=Martin|title=On human self-domestication, psychiatry, and eugenics|journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-21|pmid=17919321|pmc=2082022|url=http://www.peh-med.com/content/2/1/21}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nKraepelin's great contribution in classifying schizophrenia and manic depression remains relatively unknown to the general public, and his work, which had neither the literary quality nor paradigmatic power of Freud's, is little read outside scholarly circles. Kraepelin's contributions were also to a large extent marginalized throughout a good part of the 20th century during the success of Freudian etiological theories. However, his views now dominate many quarters of psychiatric research and academic psychiatry. His fundamental theories on the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders form the basis of the major diagnostic systems in use today, especially the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSM-IV]] and the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD]] system, based on the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] and earlier [[Feighner Criteria]] developed by espoused \"neo-Kraepelinians\", though [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] and others in the DSM committees were keen not to include assumptions about causation as Kraepelin had.<ref name=decker>{{cite journal | author = Decker Hannah S | year =  2007| title = How Kraepelinian was Kraepelin?

But when competing science museums opened in other cities, the number of visitors began to decline. After several years of losing money, the original museum closed down in 1989 and the Evoluon was converted into a conference centre, opening in 1998.\n\nIn the [[UK]] the Evoluon is chiefly remembered from [[Bert Haanstra]]'s wordless short film entitled simply ''Evoluon'', commissioned by Philips to publicise the museum, and shown as a [[trade test colour films|trade test colour film]] on [[BBC]] television from 1968 to 1972.\n\nIn October 2013 the Evoluon was used to stage four 3D-concerts by the German electronic band [[Kraftwerk]], each before an audience of 1,200 spectators. Key band member [[Ralf H\u00fctter]] handpicked the venue for its [[retro-futuristic]] look.

In this philosophical school of thought, the aim is to instill students with the \"essentials\" of academic knowledge, enacting a back-to-basics approach. Essentialism ensures that the accumulated wisdom of our civilization as taught in the traditional academic disciplines is passed on from teacher to student. Such disciplines might include [[Reading (process)|Reading]], [[Writing]], [[Literature]], [[Foreign language|Foreign Languages]], [[History]], [[Mathematics]], [[Science]], [[Art]], and [[Music]]. Moreover, this traditional approach is meant to train the mind, promote reasoning, and ensure a common culture.\n\n==Principles of essentialism==\n\nEssentialism is a relatively [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance to education that strives to teach students the knowledge of a society and civilization through a core curriculum. This core curriculum involves such areas that include the study of the surrounding environment, basic [[natural law]]s, and the disciplines that promote a happier, more educated living.<ref>{{cite book|last=Howick|first=William H.|title=Philosophies of Western Education|year=1971|page=49}}</ref> Other non-traditional areas are also integrated as well in moderation to balance the education. Essentialists' goals are to instill students with the \"essentials\" of [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic knowledge]], [[patriotism]], and [[Moral character|character development]] through traditional (or back-to-basic) approaches. This is to promote reasoning, train the mind, and ensure a common culture for all citizens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sadker|first=David Miller|title=Teacher-Centered Philosophies|url=http://www.education.com/reference/article/Ref_Teacher_Centered|work=Teachers, Schools, and Society: A Brief Introduction to Education}}</ref>\n\nEssentialism is the most typically enacted philosophy in [[United States|American]] classrooms today. Traces of this can be found in the organized learning centered on [[teacher]]s and [[textbook]]s, in addition to the regular assignments and evaluations.\n\n===Essentialism as a teacher-centered philosophy===\n\nThe role of the teacher as the leader of the classroom is a very important tenet of Educational essentialism. The teacher is the center of the [[classroom]], so they should be rigid and disciplinary. Establishing order in the classroom is crucial for student learning; effective teaching cannot take place in a loud and disorganized environment. It is the teacher's responsibility to keep order in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Essentialism In Education|url=http://www.excite.com/education/education/essentialism-in-education|work=Excite Education|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>  The teacher must interpret essentials of the learning process, take the [[leadership]] position and set the [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of the classroom. These needs require an educator who is academically well-qualified with an appreciation for learning and development. The teacher must control the students with distributions of rewards and penalties.<ref>{{cite book|last=Howick|first=William H|title=Philosophies of Western Education|year=1971|page=51}}</ref>\n\n==History of essentialism==\nThe Essentialist movement first began in the [[United States]] in the year 1938. In [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], a group met for the first time called \"The Essentialist's Committee for the Advancement of Education.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Howick|first=William H|title=Philosophies of Western Education|year=1971|page=50}}</ref> Their emphasis was to reform the educational system to a [[rationality]]-based system.\n\nThe term essentialist first appeared in the book ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education'' which was written by Michael John Demiashkevich.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Null|first=James Wesley|date=2007|title=William C. Bagley and the Founding of Essentialism: An Untold Story in American Educational History|url=http://www.tcrecord.org/library/abstract.asp?contentid=12868|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=109|issue=4|pages=1013\u20131055|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> In his book, Demiashkevich labels some specific educators (including [[William Bagley (educator)|William C. Bagley]]) as \u201cessentialists.\" Demiashkevich compared the essentialists to the different viewpoints of the [[Progressive Education Association]]. He described how the Progressives preached a \u201chedonistic doctrine of change\u201d whereas the essentialists stressed the moral responsibility of man for his actions and looked toward permanent principles of behavior (Demiashkevich likened the arguments to those between the Socratics and the Sophists in Greek philosophy).<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1938 Bagley and other educators met together where Bagley gave a speech detailing the main points of the essentialism movement and attacking the [[Public Education|public education]] in the United States. One point that Bagley noted was that students in the U.S. were not getting an education on the same levels as students in [[Europe]] who were the same age.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA recent branch has emerged within the essentialist school of thought called \"neoessentialism.\" Emerging in the eighties as a response to the essentialist ideals of the thirties as well as to the criticism of the fifties and the advocates for education in the seventies, neoessentialism was created to try to appease the problems facing the United States at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ornstein|first=Allan|title=Foundations of Education|year=1993|page=465}}</ref> The most notable change within this school of thought is that it called for the creation of a new discipline, computer science.\n\n===Renowned essentialists===\n\n[[William Bagley (educator)|William Bagley]] (1874\u20131946) was an important historical essentialist. William C. Bagley completed his undergraduate degree at Michigan Agricultural College in 1895. It wasn\u2019t until after finishing his undergraduate studies that he truly wanted to be a teacher.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bagley did his Graduate studies at the University of Chicago and at Cornell University. He acquired his Ph.D. in 1900, after which he took his first school job as a [[School Principal|Principal]] in a [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] [[Primary school|Elementary School]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Bagley\u2019s devotion increased during his work at Montana State Normal School in Dillon, Montana. It was here where he decided to dedicate his time to the education of teachers and where he published ''[[The Educative Process]]'', launching his name across the nation. Throughout his career Bagley argued against the conservative position that teachers were not in need of special training for their work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He believed that [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] material was important in teacher education. Bagley also believed the dominant theories of education of the time were weak and lacking.\n\nIn April 1938, he published the ''Essentialist's Platform'', in which he outlined three major points of essentialism. He described the right of students to a well-educated and culturally knowledgeable teacher. Secondly, he discussed the importance of teaching the ideals of community to each group of students. Lastly, Bagley wrote of the importance of accuracy, thoroughness and effort on the part of the student in the classroom.\n\nAnother important essentialist is [[E. D. Hirsch]] (1928-). Hirsch was Founder and Chairman of the [[Core Knowledge Foundation]] and authored several books concerning fact-based approaches to education. Now retired, he spent many years teaching at the University of Virginia while also being an advocate for the \"back to basics\" movement. In his most popular book, ''Cultural Literacy \u2014 What Every American Needs To Know'', he offers lists, quotations, and information regarding what he believes is essential knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|title=School: The Story of American Public Education|work=PBS|publisher=Roundtable, Inc|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/publicschool/innovators/hirsch.html|year=2001|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSee also [[Arthur Bestor]].\n\n==Schools enacting an essentialist curriculum==\nThe [[Core Knowledge Foundation|Core Knowledge Schools]] were founded on the philosophy of essentialist [[E.D. Hirsch]]. Although it is difficult to maintain a pure and strict essentialist-only [[curriculum]], these schools have the central aim of establishing a common knowledge base for all citizens. To do so, they follow a nationwide, content-specific, and teacher-centered curriculum. The Core Knowledge curriculum also allows for local variance above and beyond the core curriculum. Central curricular aims are academic excellence and the learning of knowledge, and teachers who are masters of their knowledge areas serve this aim.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Our Philosophy\n  | work = Core Knowledge\n  | publisher = Core Knowledge Foundation\n  | url = http://www.coreknowledge.org/our-philosophy\n  | accessdate = 19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism of essentialism==\n\nBecause Essentialism is largely teacher-centered, the role of the [[student]] is often called into question. Presumably, in an essentialist classroom, the teacher is the one designing the curriculum for the students based upon the core disciplines. Moreover, he or she is enacting the curriculum and setting the standards which the students must meet. The teacher's evaluative role may undermine students' interest in study.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}</ref> As a result, the students begin to take on more of a passive role in their education as they are forced to meet and learn such standards and information.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Philosophies of Western Education|last=Howick|first=William H.|year=1971|page=53}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there is also speculation that an essentialist education helps in promoting the [[cultural lag]].<ref name=\":0\" /> This philosophy of education is very traditional in the mindset of passing on the knowledge of the culture via the academic disciplines. Thus, students are forced to think in the mindset of the larger [[culture]], and individual [[creativity]] and subversive investigation are often not emphasized, or even outright discouraged.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Educational perennialism]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Philosophy of education sidebar |expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Educational Essentialism}}\n[[Category:Philosophy of education]]\n[[Category:Essentialism]]", "sha1": "65zbafaj6pv47tt8834xbmhh5uo6nrz"}}, {"title": "Progressive education", "ns": "0", "id": "10005", "revision": {"id": "853545623", "parentid": "853545525", "timestamp": "2018-08-05T14:24:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnselmiJuan", "id": "11319216"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Progressivism}}\n\n'''Progressive education''' is a [[pedagogical]] movement that began in the late nineteenth century; it has persisted in various forms to the present.

Locke believed that \"truth and knowledge\u2026 arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas\".<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite book\n|title=The progressive education movement: Is it still a factor in today's schools?\n|first=William\n|last=Hayes\n|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Education\n|year=2006}}\n</ref>{{rp|2}} He further discussed the need for children to have concrete experiences in order to learn. Rousseau deepened this line of thinking in [[Emile, or On Education]], where he argued that subordination of students to teachers and memorization of facts would not lead to an education.\n\n===Johann Bernhard Basedow===\nIn Germany, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]] (1724\u20131790) established the Philanthropinum at [[Dessau]] in 1774. He developed new teaching methods based on conversation and play with the child, and a program of physical development. Such was his success that he wrote a treatise on his methods, \"On the best and hitherto unknown method of teaching children of noblemen\".\n\n===Christian Gotthilf Salzmann===\n[[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]] (1744\u20131811) was the founder of the [[Schnepfenthal institution]], a school dedicated to new modes of education (derived heavily from the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]). He wrote ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'', one of the first books translated into English by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].\n\n===Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi===\n[[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (1746\u20131827) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] and educational reformer who exemplified [[Romanticism]] in his approach. He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was \"Learning by head, hand and heart\". His research and theories closely resemble those outlined by Rousseau in Emile. He is further considered by many to be the \"father of modern educational science\"<ref name=\"Hayes\"/> His psychological theories pertain to education as they focus on the development of object teaching, that is, he felt that individuals best learned through experiences and through a direct manipulation and experience of objects. He further speculated that children learn through their own internal motivation rather than through compulsion. (See Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic motivation). A teacher's task will be to help guide their students as individuals through their learning and allow it to unfold naturally.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=A History of Education in American Culture\n|first1=R Freeman\n|last1=Butts\n|first2=Lawrence\n|last2=Cremin\n|year=1958\n}}</ref>\n\n===Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel===\n[[Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]] (1782\u20131852) was a student of Pestalozzi who laid the foundation for modern [[education]] based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He believed in \"self-activity\" and play as essential factors in child education. The teacher's role was not to indoctrinate but to encourage self-expression through play, both individually and in group activities. He created the concept of [[kindergarten]].\n\n===Johann Friedrich Herbart===\n[[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776\u20131841) emphasized the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice, and Equity or Recompense.<ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Blyth |first=A. |year=1981 |title=From individuality to character: the Herbartian sociology applied to education| journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|volume=29 |number=1 |pages=69\u201379 |doi=10.2307/3120425|jstor=3120425 }}</ref> According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development.  In order to develop a child to lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilize a methodology with five formal steps: \"Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back, and deductively summed up the lesson's achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living\".<ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Miller |first=E.J. |year=2003|title=Teaching methods, the Herbartian revolution and Douglas Clay Ridgley at Illinois State Normal University |journal=Journal of Geography|volume=102 |issue=3 |page=114 |doi=10.1080/00221340308978532}}</ref>\n\n===John Melchior Bosco===\n[[Don Bosco|John Melchior Bosco]] (1815\u20131888) was concerned about the education of street children who had left their villages to find work in the rapidly industrialized city of [[Turin]], Italy. Exploited as cheap labor or imprisoned for unruly behavior, Bosco saw the need of creating a space where they would feel at home. He called it an 'Oratory' where they could play, learn, share friendships, express themselves, develop their creative talents and pick up skills for gainful self-employment. With those who had found work, he set up a mutual-fund society (an early version of the [[Grameen Bank]]) to teach them the benefits of saving and self-reliance. The principles underlying his educational method that won over the hearts and minds of thousands of youth who flocked to his oratory were: 'be reasonable', 'be kind', 'believe' and 'be generous in service'. Today his method of education is practiced in nearly 3000 institutions set up around the world by the members of the [[Salesian Society]] he founded in 1873.\n\n===Cecil Reddie===\nWhile studying for his doctorate in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1882\u20131883, [[Cecil Reddie]] was greatly impressed by the progressive educational theories being applied there.  Reddie founded [[Abbotsholme School]] in [[Derbyshire]], England in 1889. Its curriculum enacted the ideas of progressive education. Reddie rejected rote learning, classical languages and corporal punishment. He combined studies in modern languages and the sciences and arts with a program of physical exercise, manual labour, recreation, crafts and arts. Abbotsholme was imitated throughout Europe and was particularly influential in Germany.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/494634/Cecil-Reddie\n|accessdate=10 October 2013\n}}</ref> He often engaged foreign teachers, who learned its practices, before returning home to start their own schools.

[[John Dewey]], a principal figure in this movement from the 1880s to 1904, set the tone for educational philosophy as well as concrete school reforms. His thinking had been influenced by the ideas of Fr\u00f6bel and Herbart.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Froebel's Educational Principles\n|first=John\n|last=Dewey\n|chapter=5\n|publisher=University of Chicago\n|year= 1915\n|pages=111\u2013127\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Development of Education in the Twentieth Century\n|first=Adolphe Erich\n|last=Meyer\n|publisher=Prentice Hall\n|year=1939\n}}</ref> His reactions to the prevailing theories and practices in education, corrections made to these philosophies, and recommendations to teachers and administrators to embrace \"the new education\", provide a vital account of the history of the development of educational thinking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

His theoretical standpoints are divided into five sections outlined below.\n\n====What education is====\nEducation according to Dewey is the \"participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race\" (Dewey, 1897, para. 1).  As such, education should take into account that the student is a social being. The process begins at birth with the child unconsciously gaining knowledge and gradually developing their knowledge to share and partake in society.\n\nThe educational process has two sides, the psychological and the sociological, with the psychological forming the basis. (Dewey, 1897). A child's own instincts will help develop the material that is presented to them. These instincts also form the basis of their knowledge with everything building upon it. This forms the basis of Dewey's assumption that one cannot learn without motivation.\n\nInstruction must focus on the child as a whole for you can never be sure as to where society may end or where that student will be needed or will take them.\n\n====What the school is====\n\"Education fails because it neglects this fundamental principle of the school as a form of community life. It conceives the school as a place where certain information is to be given, where certain lessons are to be learned, or where certain habits are to be formed\" (Dewey, 1897, para. 17) Dewey felt that as education is a social construct, it is, therefore, a part of society and should reflect the community.\n\n\"Education is the process of living and is not meant to be the preparation of future living\", (Dewey, 1897), so the school must represent the present life. As such, parts of the student's home life (such as moral and ethical education) should take part in the schooling process. The teacher is a part of this, not as an authoritative figure, but as a member of the community who is there to assist the student.\n\n====The subject matter of education====\nAccording to Dewey, the curriculum in the schools should reflect that of society. The center of the school curriculum should reflect the development of humans in society. The study of the core subjects (language, science, history) should be coupled with the study of cooking, sewing, and manual training. Furthermore, he feels that \"progress is not in the succession of studies but in the development of new attitudes towards, and new interests in, experience\" (Dewey, 1897, para. 38)\n\n====The nature of method====\nThe method is focused on the child's powers and interests. If the child is thrown into a passive role as a student, absorbing information, the result is a waste of the child's education. (Dewey, 1897). Information presented to the student will be transformed into new forms, images, and symbols by the student so that they fit with their development and interests. The development of this is natural. To repress this process and attempt to \"substitute the adult for the child\" (Dewey, 1897, para. 52) would weaken the intellectual curiosity of the child.\n\n====The school and social progress====\nFor Dewey, education, which regulates \"the process of coming to share in the social consciousness,\" is the \"only sure\" method of ensuring social progress and reform (Dewey, 1897, para. 60). In this respect, Dewey foreshadows [[Critical_pedagogy|Social Reconstructionism]], whereby schools are a means to reconstruct society.  As schools become a means for social reconstruction, they must be given the proper equipment to perform this task and guide their students.<ref>Dewey, John. (1897). My pedagogical creed.

She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912, Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine- to fourteen-year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students\u2019 own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students\u2019 reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject.<ref name=\"Dalton education\">{{cite web|url=https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education|title=Piet van der Ploeg - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen - Academia.edu|website=xs4all.academia.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties, Dalton education spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest, particularly in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Rudolf Steiner===\n[[Rudolf Steiner]] (1869\u20131925) first described the principles of what was to become [[Waldorf education]] in 1907. He established a series of schools based on these principles beginning in 1919. The focus of the education is on creating a developmentally appropriate curriculum that holistically integrates practical, artistic, social, and academic experiences.<ref>* [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/steinere.pdf Heiner Ullrich, \"Rudolf Steiner\"], ''Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education'' (Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education), vol.XXIV, no. 3/4, 1994, p.&nbsp;555\u2013572</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-big-question-who-was-rudolf-steiner-and-what-were-his-revolutionary-teaching-ideas-433407.html \"Who was Rudolf Steiner and what were his revolutionary teaching ideas?\" [[Richard Garner]], Education Editor, ''The Independent'']</ref> There are more than a thousand schools and many more [[early childhood]] centers worldwide; it has also become a popular form of [[homeschooling]].<ref name=schulliste>[http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Waldorf_World_List/Waldorf_World_List.pdf Statistics for Waldorf schools worldwide]</ref><ref>M.

She based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as \"scientific pedagogy\", arguing for the need to go beyond observation and measurement of students, to developing new methods to transform them. Although [[Montessori education]] spread to the United States in 1911 there were conflicts with the American educational establishment and was opposed by William Heard Kilpatrick. However Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there.\n\n===Robert Baden-Powell===\nIn July 1906, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sent [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] a copy of his book ''The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians''. Seton was a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States. They shared ideas about youth training programs.<ref name=\"SetonInfed\">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm |title=Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft |publisher=InFed |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name=\"BPInfed\">{{cite web |year=2002 |title=Robert Baden-Powell as an Educational Innovator |publisher=InFed |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called ''Boy Patrols''.

The Brownsea camp and the publication of  ''Scouting for Boys'' are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement which spread throughout the world. Baden-Powell and his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] introduced the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]] in 1910.\n\n===Comparison with traditional education===\n{{Main|Traditional education}}\n\nTraditional education uses extrinsic motivation, such as grades and prizes. Progressive education is more likely to use intrinsic motivation, basing activities on the interests of the child. Praise may be discouraged as a motivator.<ref name=\"Kohn1999\">{{cite book|author=Alfie Kohn|title=Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fFsZWg-JfAC|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=30 September 1999|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-52615-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Montessori2006\">{{cite book|author=Maria Montessori|title=The Montessori Method|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2l-xJQDziqcC&pg=PR7|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=1 September 2006|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-943-6|page=21}}</ref> Progressive education is a response to traditional methods of teaching.

As in Spain the schools were intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, an early proponent of progressive education was [[Alva Myrdal]], who with her husband Gunnar co-wrote ''[[Crisis in the Population Question|Kris i befolkningsfr\u00e5gan]]'' (1934), a most influential program for the social-democratic hegemony (1932\u20131976) popularly known as \"[[Folkhemmet]]\". School reforms went through government reports in the 1940s and trials in the 1950s, resulting in the introduction in 1962 of public comprehensive schools (\"grundskola\") instead of the previously separated parallel schools for theoretical and non-theoretical education.<ref>A critical overview of the bureaucratic process in Sweden is given in Inger Enkvist, ''De svenska skolreformerna 1962\u20131985 och personerna bakom dem'' (2016), {{ISBN|978-91-7844-954-5}}.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe ideas from Reddie's Abbotsholme spread to schools such as [[Bedales School]] (1893), [[King Alfred School, London]] (1898) and [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]] (1915), as well as all the [[Quakers|Friends']] schools, [[Waldorf education|Steiner Waldorf]] schools and those belonging to the [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square Conference]].

He implemented his ideas with the founding of [[Summerhill School]] in 1921. Neill believed that children learn better when they are not compelled to attend lessons. The school was also managed democratically, with regular meetings to determine school rules. Pupils had equal voting rights with school staff.\n\n===United States===\n====Early practitioners====\nFr\u00f6bel's student [[Margarethe Schurz]] founded the first kindergarten in the United States at [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856, and she also inspired [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States \u2013 the language at Schurz's kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community \u2013 in [[Boston]] in 1860. This paved the way for the concept's spread in the USA. The German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but was obliged to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in New York City.\n\n[[William Heard Kilpatrick]] (1871\u20131965) was a pupil of Dewey and one of the most effective practitioners of the concept as well as the more adept at proliferating the progressive education movement and spreading word of the works of Dewey. He is especially well known for his \"project method of teaching\".<ref name=\"Hayes\"/> This developed the progressive education notion that students were to be engaged and taught so that their knowledge may be directed to society for a socially useful need. Like Dewey he also felt that students should be actively engaged in their learning rather than actively disengaged with the simple reading and regurgitation of material.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/>\n\nThe most famous early practitioner of progressive education was [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; its best-known spokesperson was the philosopher [[John Dewey]].  In 1875 Francis Parker became superintendent of schools in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] after spending two years in Germany studying emerging educational trends on the continent. Parker was opposed to rote learning, believing that there was no value in knowledge without understanding. He argued instead schools should encourage and respect the child's creativity. Parker's [[Quincy Method|Quincy System]] called for child-centered and experience-based learning.   He replaced the traditional curriculum with integrated learning units based on core themes related to the knowledge of different disciplines. He replaced traditional readers, spellers and [[grammar]] books with children's own writing, [[literature]], and teacher prepared materials. In 1883 Parker left Massachusetts to become Principal of the Cook County Normal School in [[Chicago]], a school that also served to train teachers in Parker's methods. In 1894 Parker's Talks on Pedagogics, which drew heavily on the thinking of [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Fr\u00f6bel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], became one of the first American writings on education to gain international fame.\n\nThat same year, philosopher John Dewey moved from the [[University of Michigan]] to the newly established [[University of Chicago]] where he became chair of the department of [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and education. He and his wife enrolled their children in Parker's school before founding their own school two years later.\n\nWhereas Parker started with practice and then moved to theory, Dewey began with hypotheses and then devised methods and curricula to test them. By the time Dewey moved to Chicago at the age of thirty-five, he had already published two books on psychology and applied psychology. He had become dissatisfied with philosophy as pure speculation and was seeking ways to make philosophy directly relevant to practical issues. Moving away from an early interest in [[Hegel]], Dewey proceeded to reject all forms of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and dichotomy in favor of a philosophy of experience as a series of unified wholes in which everything can be ultimately related.\n\nIn 1896, John Dewey opened what he called the laboratory school to test his theories and their sociological implications. With Dewey as the director and his wife as principal, the University of Chicago Laboratory school, was dedicated \"to discover in administration, selection of subject-matter, methods of learning, teaching, and [[discipline]], how a school could become a cooperative community while developing in individuals their own capacities and satisfy their own needs.\" (Cremin, 136) For Dewey the two key goals of developing a cooperative [[community]] and developing [[individual]]s' own capacities were not at odds; they were necessary to each other. This unity of purpose lies at the heart of the progressive education philosophy. In 1912, Dewey sent out students of his philosophy to found [[The Park School of Buffalo]] and [[The Park School of Baltimore]] to put it into practice. These schools operate to this day within a similar progressive approach.\n\nAt Columbia, Dewey worked with other educators such as Charles Eliot and Abraham Flexner to help bring progressivism into the mainstream of American education. In 1917 Columbia established the Lincoln School of Teachers College \"as a laboratory for the working out of an elementary and secondary curriculum which shall eliminate obsolete material and endeavor to work up in usable form material adapted to the needs of modern living.\" (Cremin, 282)  Based on Flexner's demand that the modern curriculum \"include nothing for which an affirmative case can not be made out\" (Cremin, 281) the new school organized its activities around four fundamental fields: [[science]], [[industry]], [[aesthetics]] and [[civics]]. The Lincoln School built its curriculum around \"units of work\" that reorganized traditional subject matter into forms embracing the development of children and the changing needs of adult life. The first and second grades carried on a study of community life in which they actually built a city. A third grade project growing out of the day-to-day life of the nearby [[Hudson River]] became one of the most celebrated units of the school, a unit on boats, which under the guidance of its legendary teacher Miss Curtis, became an entr\u00e9e into [[history]], [[geography]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[arithmetic]], science, [[art]] and literature. Each of the units was broadly enough conceived so that different children could concentrate on different aspects depending on their own interests and needs. Each of the units called for widely diverse student activities, and each sought to deal in depth with some critical aspect of contemporary civilization. Finally each unit engaged children working together cooperatively and also provided opportunities for individual research and exploration.\n\nIn 1924, [[Agnes de Lima]], the lead writer on education for ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', published a collection of her articles on progressive education as a book, titled ''Our Enemy the Child''.<ref>Agnes de Lima.  In James Guthrie, Editor in Chief, ''Encyclopedia of Education'' (pp.&nbsp;553\u2013554).  New York: Thomson Gale (2003).</ref>\n\nIn 1918 The [[National Education Association]], representing superintendents and administrators in smaller districts across the country, issued its report \"Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education.\"  It emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They Emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education.<ref>Karen Graves, \"The Cardinal Principles,\", ''American Educational History Journal'' (2010) 37#1-2, pp 95-107</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1955 the [[Progressive Education Association]] founded by [[Stanwood Cobb#Career as educator|Stanwood Cobb]] and others worked to promote a more student-centered approach to education. During the [[Great Depression]] the organization conducted the [[Eight-Year Study]], evaluating the effects of progressive programs. More than 1500 students over four years were compared to an equal number of carefully matched students at conventional schools. When they reached college, the experimental students were found to equal or surpass traditionally educated students on all outcomes: grades, extracurricular participation, dropout rates, intellectual curiosity, and resourcefulness. Moreover, the study found that the more the school departed from the traditional college preparatory program, the better was the record of the graduates. (Kohn, Schools, 232)\n\nBy mid-century many public school programs had also adopted elements of progressive curriculum. At mid-century Dewey believed that progressive education had \"not really penetrated and permeated the foundations of the educational institution.\"(Kohn, Schools, 6,7)  As the influence of progressive pedagogy grew broader and more diffuse, practitioners began to vary their application of progressive principles.   As varying interpretations and practices made evaluation of progressive reforms more difficult to assess, critics began to propose alternative approaches.\n\nThe seeds of the debate over progressive education can be seen in the differences of Parker and Dewey. These have to do with how much and by whom curriculum should be worked out from grade to grade, how much the child's emerging interests should determine classroom activities, the importance of child-centered vs. societal\u2013centered learning, the relationship of community building to individual growth, and especially the relationship between emotion, thought and experience.\n\nIn 1955 the publication of Rudolf Flesch's ''[[Rudolf Flesch#Professional Information|Why Johnny Can't Read]]'' leveled criticism of reading programs at the progressive emphasis on reading in context. The conservative [[McCarthy era]] raised questions about the liberal ideas at the roots of the progressive reforms. The launching of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 at the height of the [[cold war]] gave rise to a number of intellectually competitive approaches to disciplinary knowledge, such as [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study|BSCS]] biology [[Physical Science Study Committee|PSSC]] physics, led by university professors such as [[Jerome Bruner]] and [[Jerrold Zacharias]].\n\nSome of the cold war reforms incorporated elements of progressivism. For example, the work of Zacharias and Bruner was based in the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and incorporated many of Dewey's ideas of experiential education. Bruner's analysis of developmental psychology became the core of a pedagogical movement known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], which argues that the child is an active participant in making meaning and must be engaged in the progress of education for learning to be effective. This psychological approach has deep connections to the work of both Parker and Dewey and led to a resurgence of their ideas in second half of the century.\n\nIn 1965, President Johnson inaugurated the [[Great Society]] and the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] suffused public school programs with funds for sweeping education reforms. At the same time the influx of federal funding also gave rise to demands for accountability and the behavioral objectives approach of Robert F. Mager and others foreshadowed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] passed in 2002. Against these critics eloquent spokespersons stepped forward in defense of the progressive tradition.

Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical, electronic or digital [[audio signal]] that ultimately is plugged into a [[power amplifier]] which drives a [[loudspeaker]], creating the sound heard by the performer and listener.\n\nAn electronic instrument might include a [[user interface]] for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[frequency]], or duration of each [[Musical note|note]]. A common user interface is the [[musical keyboard]], which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic [[piano]], except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a [[synth module]], [[computer]] or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a [[MIDI controller|music controller]] ([[input device]]) and a [[music synthesizer]], respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as [[MIDI]] or [[Open Sound Control]].\n\nAll electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of [[audio signal processing]] applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called [[sound effect]]s; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.\n\nIn the 2010s, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as [[electronic dance music]], almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments (e.g., [[bass synth]], [[synthesizer]], [[drum machine]]). Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on [[New Interfaces for Musical Expression]], have organized to report cutting-edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.\n\n== Early examples ==\n{{see also|Electronic music}}\n[[Image:Clavecin \u00e9lectrique.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the clavecin \u00e9lectrique]]\nIn the 18th-century, musicians and composers adapted a number of acoustic instruments to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the [[Denis d'or]] keyboard, dating from 1753, followed shortly by the [[clavecin \u00e9lectrique]] by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The Denis d'or consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily to enhance sonic qualities. The clavecin \u00e9lectrique was a keyboard instrument with [[plectrum|plectra]] (picks) activated electrically. However, neither instrument used electricity as a sound-source.\n\nThe first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by [[Elisha Gray]].<ref name=\"elisha\">{{Citation\n |title=Electronic Musical Instrument 1870 - 1990 \n |year=2005 \n |url=http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/telegraph/ \n |accessdate=2007-04-09 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502121553/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/telegraph/ \n |archivedate=2007-05-02 \n |df= \n}}</ref><ref name=\"beginnings\">{{Citation\n |last         = Chadabe\n |first        = Joel\n |author-link  = Joel Chadabe\n |title        = The Electronic Century Part I: Beginnings\n |publisher    = Electronic Musician\n |pages        = 74&ndash;89\n |date         = February 2000\n |url          = http://emusician.com/tutorials/electronic_century1/\n |access-date  = 2011-03-02\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110407111629/http://emusician.com/tutorials/electronic_century1/\n |archive-date = 2011-04-07\n |dead-url     = yes\n |df           = \n}}</ref> The \"Musical Telegraph\" was a chance by-product of his telephone technology when Gray accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self-vibrating electromagnetic circuit and so invented a basic [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds oscillated by electromagnets and transmitted over a telephone line. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device into later models, which consisted of a diaphragm vibrating in a magnetic field.\n\nA significant invention, which later had a profound effect on electronic music, was the [[audion]] in 1906. This was the first thermionic valve, or [[vacuum tube]] and which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and electronic computation, among other things. Other early synthesizers included the [[Telharmonium]] (1897), the [[Theremin]] (1919), J\u00f6rg Mager's [[Spharophon]] (1924) and Partiturophone, Taubmann's similar [[Electronde]] (1933), [[Maurice Martenot]]'s [[ondes Martenot]] (\"Martenot waves\", 1928), Trautwein's [[Trautonium]] (1930). The Mellertion (1933) used a non-standard scale, Bertrand's Dynaphone could produce octaves and perfect fifths, while the Emicon was an American, keyboard-controlled instrument constructed in 1930 and the German Hellertion combined four instruments to produce chords. Three Russian instruments also appeared, Oubouhof's [[Croix Sonore]] (1934),  [[Ivor Darreg]]'s [[microtonal music|microtonal]] 'Electronic Keyboard Oboe' (1937) and the [[ANS synthesizer]], constructed by the Russian scientist [[Evgeny Murzin]] from 1937 to 1958. Only two models of this latter were built and the only surviving example is currently stored at the Lomonosov University in [[Moscow]]. It has been used in many Russian movies\u2014like ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''\u2014to produce unusual, \"cosmic\" sounds.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Vail\n  | first = Mark\n  | title = Eugeniy Murzin's ANS &mdash; Additive Russian synthesizer\n  | publisher = [[Keyboard Magazine]]\n  | page = 120\n  | date = November 1, 2002\n  | url = }}</ref><ref>All the preceding instruments except those of Darreg and Murzin described in P.

In 1959 [[Daphne Oram]] produced a novel method of synthesis, her \"[[Oramics]]\" technique, driven by drawings on a 35&nbsp;mm film strip; it was used for a number of years at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Manning\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Electronic and Computer Music\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press US\n  | year = 2004\n  | pages = 129&ndash;132\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P2dClS4LdPQC\n  | isbn = 0-19-514484-8}}</ref> This workshop was also responsible for the theme to the TV series [[Doctor Who]], a piece, largely created by [[Delia Derbyshire]], that more than any other ensured the popularity of electronic music in the UK.\n\n=== Telharmonium ===\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;\">\n[[Image:Teleharmonium1897.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Telharmonium console <br/>by [[Thaddeus Cahill]] 1897]]</div>\n{{main|Telharmonium}}\nIn 1897 [[Thaddeus Cahill]] patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using [[tonewheel]]s to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by [[additive synthesis]], it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the [[Hammond organ]]. Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill's enterprise was bankrupt.<ref>{{cite book|last =Weidenaar|first = Reynold|date = 1995|title = Magic Music from the Telharmonium|location=Metuchen, New Jersey|publisher= Scarecrow Press|isbn =9780810826922}}</ref>\n\n=== Theremin ===\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;\">\n{{double image |1=right\n|2=Leon Theremin.jpg      |3=120\n|4=Theremin Cello '30.jpg |5=114\n|6=Theremin (1924)\n|7=Fingerboard Theremin <!-- (1930) -->\n}}\n</div>\n{{main|Theremin}}\nAnother development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually [[Lev Termen]]) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the [[Theremin]]. This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines.  The Theremin was notable for being the first musical instrument played without touching it. In 1929, [[Joseph Schillinger]] composed ''First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra'', premi\u00e8red with the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] with [[Leon Theremin]] as soloist. The next year [[Henry Cowell]] commissioned Theremin to create the first electronic rhythm machine, called the [[Rhythmicon]]. Cowell wrote some compositions for it, and he and Schillinger premiered it in 1932.\n\n=== Ondes Martenot ===\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;\">\n[[Image:Ondes martenot.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Ondes Martenot (ca.1974, <br/>7th generation model)]]</div>\n{{main|Ondes Martenot}}\nThe 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris, [[Darius Milhaud]] began experiments with \"vocal transformation by phonograph speed change.\"<ref name = \"tvnpyt\">Herbert Russcol, ''The Liberation of Sound: An Introduction to Electronic Music'' ( Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1972): 68.</ref> These continued until 1927. This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instruments&mdash;along with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the [[Ondes Martenot]], which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the [[Trautonium]].\nMaurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Charles Koechlin|Koechlin]], [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Gilles Tremblay (composer)|Tremblay]], and [[Edgard Var\u00e8se|Var\u00e8se]]. [[Radiohead]] guitarist and multi-instrumentalist [[Jonny Greenwood]] also uses it in his compositions and a plethora of Radiohead songs. In 1937, Messiaen wrote ''F\u00eate des belles eaux'' for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in ''[[Trois petites Liturgies de la Pr\u00e9sence Divine]]'' (1943&ndash;44) and the ''[[Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie]]'' (1946&ndash;48/90).\n\n=== Trautonium ===\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;\">\n[[Image:Volkstrautonium MIM.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Volks Trautonium (1933, Telefunken Ela T 42)]]</div>\n{{main|Trautonium}}\nThe Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the [[subharmonic]] scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of ''[[Parsifal]]''. In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden premi\u00e8re of his ''Japanese Festival Music''.  This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.\n\n=== Hammond organ and Novachord ===\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;\">\n[[Image:Novachord frontS.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Hammond Novachord (1939)]]</div>\n{{main|Hammond organ|Novachord}}\nIn 1929 [[Laurens Hammond]] established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the [[Hammond organ]], which was based on the principles of the [[Telharmonium]], along with other developments including early reverberation units.<ref>Russcol 1972, 70.</ref> The Hammond organ is an electromechanical instrument, as it used both mechanical elements and electronic parts. A Hammond organ used spinning metal tonewheels to produce different sounds. A [[magnetic pickup]] similar in design to the pickups in an [[electric guitar]] is used to transmit the pitches in the tonewheels to an amplifier and speaker enclosure. While the Hammond organ was designed to be a lower-cost alternative to a [[pipe organ]] for church music, musicians soon discovered that the Hammond was an excellent instrument for [[blues]] and [[jazz]]; indeed, an entire genre of music developed built around this instrument, known as the [[organ trio]] (typically Hammond organ, drums, and a third instrument, either saxophone or guitar).\n\nThe first commercially manufactured synthesizer was the [[Novachord]], built by the [[Hammond Organ]] Company from 1938 to 1942, which offered 72-note [[Polyphony (instrument)|polyphony]] using 12 oscillators driving [[monostable]]-based divide-down circuits, basic [[envelope generator|envelope]] control and resonant [[low-pass filter]]s. The instrument featured 163 vacuum tubes and weighed 500 pounds. The instrument's use of envelope control is significant, since this is perhaps the most significant distinction between the modern synthesizer and other electronic instruments.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n== Analogue synthesis 1950\u20131980 ==\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=180\n|caption1 = Siemens Synthesizer at Siemens Studio For Electronic Music (ca.1959)\n|image1   = DM Recording Studio.jpg\n|caption2 = The RCA Mark II (ca.1957)\n|image2   = RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer.jpg\n}}\n{{Main|Analog synthesizer|Synthesizer}}\n\nThe most commonly used electronic instruments are [[synthesizer]]s, so-called because they artificially generate sound using a variety of techniques. All early circuit-based synthesis involved the use of analogue circuitry, particularly voltage controlled amplifiers, oscillators and filters. An important technological development was the invention of the [[Clavivox]] [[synthesizer]] in 1956 by [[Raymond Scott]] with subassembly by [[Robert Moog]]. French [[composer]] and engineer [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] created a variety of compositions using [[electronic horn]]s, whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote ''[[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'' for the Phillips pavilion at the [[Expo '58|Brussels World Fair]] in 1958.\n\n=== Modular synthesizers ===\n{{main|Modular synthesizer}}\n[[RCA]] produced experimental devices to synthesize voice and music in the 1950s.  The [[RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer|Mark II Music Synthesizer]], housed at the [[Computer Music Center|Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]] in [[New York City]]. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, with contributions from Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, it was only capable of producing music by programming,<ref name=\"beginnings\"/> using a [[paper tape]] [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] punched with holes to control pitch sources and filters, similar to a mechanical [[player piano]] but capable of generating a wide variety of sounds. The [[vacuum tube]] system had to be patched to create timbres.\n\n[[Image:Bob Moog3.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Moog]]\nIn the 1960s synthesizers were still usually confined to studios due to their size. They were usually modular in design, their stand-alone signal sources and processors connected with patch cords or by other means and controlled by a common controlling device. [[Harald Bode]], [[Don Buchla]], [[Hugh Le Caine]], [[Raymond Scott]] and [[Paul Ketoff]] were among the first to build such instruments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Moog established standards for control interfacing, using a logarithmic 1-volt-per-octave for pitch control and a separate triggering signal. This standardization allowed synthesizers from different manufacturers to operate simultaneously. Pitch control was usually performed either with an organ-style keyboard or a [[music sequencer]] producing a timed series of control voltages. During the late 1960s hundreds of popular recordings used Moog synthesizers. Other early commercial synthesizer manufacturers included [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]], who also started with modular synthesizers before producing all-in-one instruments, and British firm [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]].\n\n<!-- image of next section --><div style=\"clear:right;float:right;\">\n[[Image:R.A.Moog minimoog 2.jpg|thumb|center|180px|Minimoog (1970, R.A.Moog)]]</div>\n\n===Integrated synthesizers===\n\nIn 1970, Moog designed the [[Minimoog]], a non-modular synthesizer with a built-in keyboard.

Popular monophonic synthesizers include the Moog [[Minimoog]]. A few, such as the Moog Sonic Six, [[ARP Odyssey]] and EML 101, could produce two different pitches at a time when two keys were pressed.  [[Polyphony (instrument)|Polyphony]] (multiple simultaneous tones, which enables [[Chord (music)|chords]]) was only obtainable with electronic organ designs at first. Popular electronic keyboards combining organ circuits with synthesizer processing included the ARP Omni and Moog's Polymoog and Opus 3.\n\nBy 1976 affordable polyphonic synthesizers began to appear, notably the Yamaha CS-50, CS-60 and [[Yamaha CS-80|CS-80]], the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]] and the [[Oberheim]] Four-Voice. These remained complex, heavy and relatively costly. The recording of settings in digital memory allowed storage and recall of sounds. The first practical polyphonic synth, and the first to use a microprocessor as a controller, was the [[Sequential Circuits]] [[Prophet-5]] introduced in late 1977.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Wells\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = A Beginner's Guide to Digital Video\n  | publisher = AVA Books (UK)\n  | page = 10\n  | year = 2004\n  | isbn = 2-88479-037-3}}</ref> For the first time, musicians had a practical polyphonic synthesizer that could save all knob settings in computer memory and recall them at the touch of a button.

[[Iannis Xenakis]] began what is called ''musique stochastique,'' or ''[[stochastic music]]'', which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of [[glissando|glissandi]] for his orchestral composition ''Metastasis'' (1953&ndash;54), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like ''ST/4'' for string quartet and ''ST/48'' for orchestra (both 1962).\n\nThe impact of computers continued in 1956. [[Lejaren Hiller]] and [[Leonard Issacson]] composed ''[[Illiac Suite]]'' for [[string quartet]], the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using [[algorithm]]ic composition.<ref>{{cite book|last =Schwartz|first = Elliot|date =1975|title= Electronic Music: A Listener's Guide|publisher = Praeger|page = 88|isbn =  9780275537302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[Max Mathews]] at [[Bell Lab]] wrote [[MUSIC-N]] series, a first computer program family for generating digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis.

A paper was authored by [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]] of [[Sequential Circuits]] and proposed to the [[Audio Engineering Society]] in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.\n\nThe advent of MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.\n\nMIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals.

In a similar vein to Cage\u2019s aleatoric music, the art of Bending is dependent on chance, when a person prepares to bend they have no idea of the final outcome.\n}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this manipulation of circuits directly, especially to the point of destruction, was pioneered by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]] in the early 1950s, such as their work with [[John Cage]] on the ''[[Williams Mix]]'' and especially in the soundtrack to [[Forbidden Planet]].\n\nModern [[circuit bending]] is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low [[voltage]], battery-powered [[guitar effects]], children's [[toy]]s and small digital [[synthesizer]]s to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with [[noise music]], though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with \"bent\" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and [[potentiometer]]s that alter the circuit. With the revived interest for analogue synthesizer circuit bending became a cheap solution for many experimental musicians to create their own individual analogue sound generators. Nowadays many schematics can be found to build noise generators such as the [[Atari Punk Console]] or the [[Dub Siren]] as well as simple modifications for children toys such as the famous [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]]s that are often modified by circuit benders.\n\n===Modular synthesizers===\n{{main|Modular synthesizer}}\nThe modular synthesizer is a type of synthesizer consisting of separate interchangeable modules. These are also available as  kits for hobbyist DIY constructors.

Each electrode may become either the anode or the cathode depending on the direction of current through the cell. A bipolar electrode is an electrode that functions as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell.\n\n=== Primary cell ===\nA [[primary cell]] is a special type of electrochemical cell in which the reaction cannot be reversed,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhvy2NiZsQYC&pg=PA129|title=Engineering Chemistry|last=Sivasankar|date=2008|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780070669321|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221230846/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhvy2NiZsQYC&pg=PA129|archivedate=2017-12-21|df=}}</ref> and the identities of the anode and cathode are therefore fixed. The anode is always the negative electrode. The cell can be discharged but not recharged.\n\n=== Secondary cell ===\nA [[secondary cell]], for example a [[rechargeable battery]], is a cell in which the chemical reactions are reversible. When the cell is being charged, the anode becomes the positive (+) and the cathode the negative (\u2212) electrode. This is also the case in an [[electrolytic cell]]. When the cell is being discharged, it behaves like a primary cell, with the anode as the negative and the cathode as the positive electrode.\n\n==Other anodes and cathodes ==\nIn a [[vacuum tube]] or a [[semiconductor]] having polarity ([[diode]]s, [[electrolytic|electrolytic capacitor]]s) the anode is the positive (+) electrode and the cathode the negative (\u2212). The electrons enter the device through the cathode and exit the device through the anode. Many devices have other electrodes to control operation, e.g., base, gate, control grid.\n\nIn a three-electrode cell, a counter electrode, also called an [[auxiliary electrode]], is used only to make a connection to the electrolyte so that a current can be applied to the working electrode. The counter electrode is usually made of an inert material, such as a [[noble metal]] or [[graphite]], to keep it from dissolving.\n\n== Welding electrodes ==\nIn [[arc welding]], an electrode is used to conduct current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. Depending upon the process, the electrode is either consumable, in the case of [[gas metal arc welding]] or [[shielded metal arc welding]], or non-consumable, such as in [[gas tungsten arc welding]]. For a direct current system, the weld rod or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current arc welder, the welding electrode would not be considered an anode or cathode.\n\n== Alternating current electrodes ==\nFor electrical systems which use [[alternating current]], the electrodes are the connections from the circuitry to the object to be acted upon by the electric current but are not designated anode or cathode because the direction of flow of the electrons changes [[alternating current|periodically]], usually many [[hertz|times per second]].\n\n== Uses ==\nElectrodes are used to provide current through nonmetal objects to alter them in numerous ways and to measure conductivity for numerous purposes. Examples include:\n*Electrodes for [[fuel cell]]s\n*Electrodes for medical purposes, such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] (for recording brain activity), [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] (recording [[Cardiac cycle|heart beats]]), [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] (electrical brain stimulation), [[defibrillator]] (recording and delivering cardiac stimulation)\n*Electrodes for [[electrophysiology]] techniques in biomedical research\n*Electrodes for execution by the [[electric chair]]\n*Electrodes for [[electroplating]]\n*Electrodes for [[arc welding]]\n*Electrodes for [[cathodic protection]]\n*Electrodes for [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]]\n*Electrodes for [[chemical analysis]] using [[electrochemical]] methods\n*Inert electrodes for [[electrolysis]] (made of [[platinum]])\n*[[Membrane electrode assembly]]\n*Electrodes for [[Taser]] electroshock weapon\n\n==Chemically modified electrodes==\n[[Chemically modified electrode]]s are electrodes that have their surfaces chemically modified to change the electrode's [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemical]], [[electrochemical]], [[optical]], [[electrical]], and transportive properties.

The usual form is [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, although [[diary|diary entries]], [[newspaper]] clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic \"documents\" such as recordings and radio, [[blogs]], and [[e-mails]] have also come into use. The word ''[[wikt:epistolary|epistolary]]'' is derived from [[Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae ''epistol\u0113'', meaning a letter (see [[epistle]]).\n\nThe epistolary form can add greater [[realism (arts)|realism]] to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an [[omniscient narrator]].\n\n==Early works==\nThere are two theories on the genesis of the epistolary novel. The first claims that the genre originated from novels with inserted letters, in which the portion containing the third person narrative in between the letters was gradually reduced.<ref>E.Th. Voss. ''Erz\u00e4hlprobleme des Briefromans, dargestellt an vier Beispielen des 18. Jahrhunderts.'' Bonn, 1960.</ref> The other theory claims that the epistolary novel arose from [[Miscellany|miscellanies]] of letters and poetry: some of the letters were tied together into a (mostly amorous) plot.<ref>B.A. Bray. ''L'art de la lettre amoureuse: des manuels aux romans (1550-1700).'' La Haye/Paris, 1967</ref> Both claims have some validity. The first truly epistolary novel, the Spanish \"Prison of Love\" (''C\u00e1rcel de amor'') (c.1485) by [[Diego de San Pedro]], belongs to a tradition of novels in which a large number of inserted letters already dominated the narrative. Other well-known examples of early epistolary novels are closely related to the tradition of letter-books and miscellanies of letters. Within the successive editions of [[Edm\u00e9 Boursault]]'s ''Letters of Respect, Gratitude and Love'' (''Lettres de respect, d'obligation et d'amour'') (1669), a group of letters written to a girl named Babet were expanded and became more and more distinct from the other letters, until it formed a small epistolary novel entitled ''Letters to Babet'' (''Lettres \u00e0 Babet''). The immensely famous ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' (''Lettres portugaises'') (1669) generally attributed to [[Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues]], though a small minority still regard [[Marianna Alcoforado]] as the author, is claimed to be intended to be part of a miscellany of Guilleragues prose and poetry.<ref>G. de [[Guilleragues]]. ''Lettres portugaises, Valentins et autres oeuvres.'' Paris, 1962</ref>\nThe founder of the epistolary novel in English is said by many to be [[James Howell]] (1594\u20131666) with [[Epistolae Ho-Elianae | \"Familiar Letters\"]] (1645\u201350), who writes of prison, foreign adventure, and the love of women.\n\nThe first novel to expose the complex play that the genre allows was [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', which appeared in three volumes in 1684, 1685, and 1687. The novel shows the genre's results of changing perspectives: individual points were presented by the individual characters, and the central voice of the author and moral evaluation disappeared (at least in the first volume; her further volumes introduced a narrator). Behn furthermore explored a realm of intrigue with letters that fall into the wrong hands, faked letters, letters withheld by protagonists, and even more complex interaction.\n\nThe epistolary novel as a genre became popular in the 18th century in the works of such authors as [[Samuel Richardson]], with his immensely successful novels ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela]]'' (1740) and ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1749). In France, there was ''[[Lettres persanes]]'' (1721) by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], followed by ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]]'' (1761) by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Laclos]]' ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782), which used the epistolary form to great dramatic effect, because the sequence of events was not always related directly or explicitly. In Germany, there was [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774) (''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'') and [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]'s ''[[Hyperion (H\u00f6lderlin)|Hyperion]]''. The first North American novel, ''The History of Emily Montague'' (1769) by [[Frances Brooke]] was written in epistolary form.\n\nStarting in the 18th century, the epistolary form was subject to much ridicule, resulting in a number of savage [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]]s. The most notable example of these was [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Shamela]]'' (1741), written as a parody of ''Pamela''. In it, the female narrator can be found wielding a pen and scribbling her diary entries under the most dramatic and unlikely of circumstances. [[Oliver Goldsmith]] used the form to satirical effect in ''[[The Citizen of the World]]'', subtitled \"Letters from a Chinese Philosopher Residing in London to his Friends in the East\" (1760\u201361). So did the diarist [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]] in a successful comic first novel, ''[[Evelina]]'' (1788).\n\nThe epistolary novel slowly fell out of use in the late 18th century. Although [[Jane Austen]] tried her hand at the epistolary in juvenile writings and her [[novella]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1794), she abandoned this structure for her later work. It is thought that her lost novel ''First Impressions'', which was redrafted to become ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', may have been epistolary: ''Pride and Prejudice'' contains an unusual number of letters quoted in full and some play a critical role in the plot.\n\nThe epistolary form nonetheless saw continued use, surviving in exceptions or in fragments in nineteenth-century novels. In [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[M\u00e9moires de deux jeunes mari\u00e9es|Letters of Two Brides]]'', two women who became friends during their education at a convent correspond over a 17-year period, exchanging letters describing their lives. [[Mary Shelley]] employs the epistolary form in her novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818). Shelley uses the letters as one of a variety of framing devices, as the story is presented through the letters of a sea captain and scientific explorer attempting to reach the north pole who encounters Victor Frankenstein and records the dying man's narrative and confessions. Published in 1848, [[Anne Bront\u00eb]]'s novel ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' is framed as a retrospective letter from one of the main heroes to his friend and brother-in-law with the diary of the eponymous tenant inside it. In the late 19th century, [[Bram Stoker]] released one of the most widely recognized and successful novels in the epistolary form to date, ''[[Dracula]]''. Printed in 1897, the novel is compiled entirely of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, doctor's notes, ship's logs, and the like.\n\n==Types==\nThere are three types of epistolary novels: monologic (giving the letters of only one character, like ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun'' and ''The Sorrows of Young Werther''), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters, like Mme [[Marie Jeanne Riccoboni]]'s ''Letters of Fanni Butlerd'' (1757), and polylogic (with three or more letter-writing characters, such as in Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''). In addition, a crucial element in polylogic epistolary novels like ''Clarissa'', and ''Dangerous Liaisons'' is the dramatic device of 'discrepant awareness': the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains creating dramatic tension.\n\nAn important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the [[fictional editor]].<ref>A. Takeda. ''Die Erfindung des Anderen: Zur Genese des fiktionalen Herausgebers im Briefroman des 18. Jahrhunderts''. W\u00fcrzburg, 2008; U. Wirth.

Munich, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Later works==\n{{see also|List of contemporary epistolary novels}}\nEpistolary novels have made several memorable appearances in more recent literature:\n\n*[[John Cleland]]'s early erotic novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748) is written as a series of letters from the titular character to an unnamed recipient.\n*''[[The Coquette|The Coquette; or, The History of Eliza Wharton]]'' (1797) by [[Hannah Webster Foster]] is a series of letters between several characters.\n*[[Sophia Briscoe]] used the form in both her novels: ''Miss Melmoth...'' (1771) and ''The Fine Lady...'' (1772).\n*[[Marianne Ehrmann]] wrote the epistolary novel ''Amalie and Minna'' around 1787. \n*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] used the epistolary format for his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'' (1846), as a series of letters between two friends, struggling to cope with their impoverished circumstances and life in pre-revolution Russia.\n*''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868) by [[Wilkie Collins]] uses a collection of various documents to construct a detective novel in English. In the second piece, a character explains that he is writing his portion because another had observed to him that the events surrounding the disappearance of the eponymous diamond might reflect poorly on the family, if misunderstood, and therefore he was collecting the true story. This is an unusual element, as most epistolary novels present the documents without questions about how they were gathered. He also used the form previously in ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' (1859).\n*Spanish foreign minister [[Juan Valera y Alcal\u00e1-Galiano|Juan Valera's]] ''Pepita Jimenez'' (1874) is written in three sections, the first and third being a series of letters, the middle part narrated by an unknown observer.\n*[[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) uses not only letters and diaries, but also dictation [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinders]] and [[newspaper]] accounts.\n*[[Jean Webster]]'s ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy-Long-Legs]]'' (1912).\n*[[Dorothy L.

By 2000, \"evidence-based medicine\" had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both population-level and individual-level decisions. In subsequent years, use of the term \"evidence-based\" had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is \"evidence-based health services\", which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.<ref name=\"gray\">{{cite book|author=Gray, J.

However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy, and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises.<ref name=eddy5 /> The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence.<ref name=feinstein2 /> Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for [[governmentality]] in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.<ref name=sackett />\n\n==Methods==\n\n===Steps===\nThe steps for designing explicit, evidence-based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: Formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in \"evidence tables\"; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a \"balance sheet\"; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.<ref name=eddy4/>\n\nFor the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH |title=Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis.

In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion \"does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence\" and continue that \"expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone\").<ref name=\"Tonelli99\">{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187\u201392 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}</ref> have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.\n\nSeveral organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence.

In the case of randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high, but can be downgraded in five different domains.<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\">{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|year=2009|url=http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|edition=Version 3.2|veditors=[[Holger Jens Sch\u00fcnemann|Sch\u00fcnemann]] H, Bro\u017cek J, Oxman A|access-date=2016-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305115426/http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\n* Risk of bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies has influenced the estimate of effect.\n* Imprecision: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely.\n* Indirectness: Is a judgement made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied.\n* Inconsistency: Is a judgement made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies.\n* Publication bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account.\n\nIn the case of observational studies per GRADE, the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\"/>\n\n* Large effect: This is when methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely.\n* Plausible confounding would change the effect: This is when despite the presence of a possible confounding factor which is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect.\n* Dose response gradient: This is when the intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.\n\nMeaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:<ref name=\"balshem2011\"/>\n* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as \"there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions.\"\n* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions.\n* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as \"further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely.\"\n* Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as \"new research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely.\"\n\n===Categories of recommendations===\nIn guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M|author2=Burak K|author3=Maroun J|title=Multidisciplinary Canadian Consensus Recommendations for the Management and Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma\u2019|journal=Current Oncology|year=2012|volume=18|issue=5|pages=228\u201340|pmc=3185900|doi=10.3747/co.v18i5.952|pmid=21980250|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.\n* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.\n* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations.\n* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.\n* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.\n\nGRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\"/>\n\nDespite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.\n\n===Statistical measures===\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:\n\n*Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.\n*AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.\n*[[Number needed to treat]] (NNT)/[[Number needed to harm]] (NNH). Number needed to treat or number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1339 women age 50\u201359 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,<ref name=\"BandolierStatins2004\">\"Patient Compliance with statins\" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150512021122/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html |date=2015-05-12 }}</ref> then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.\n\n===Quality of clinical trials===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.\n\n*Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.\n*Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.\n*Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.\n*Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.\n\n==Limitations and criticism==\nAlthough evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use.<ref name=\"Timmermans2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201328 |year=2005 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/1/18.long |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}</ref> Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister (\"limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine\")<ref name=\"Straus-McAlister-2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Straus|first1=SE|last2=McAlister|first2=FA|title=Evidence-based medicine: a commentary on common criticisms|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=3 October 2000|volume=163|issue=7|pages=837\u201341|pmid=11033714|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/7/837.full.pdf|pmc=80509}}</ref> and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).<ref name=\"Cohen-2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AM|last2=Stavri|first2=PZ|last3=Hersh|first3=WR|title=A categorization and analysis of the criticisms of Evidence-Based Medicine|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=February 2004|volume=73|issue=1|pages=35\u201343|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2003.11.002|pmid=15036077|url=http://skynet.ohsu.edu/~hersh/ijmi-04-ebm.pdf|df=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn no particular order, some published objections include:\n\n* The theoretical ideal of EBM (that every narrow clinical question, of which hundreds of thousands can exist, would be answered by meta-analysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs) faces the limitation that research (especially the RCTs themselves) is expensive; thus, in reality, for the foreseeable future, there will always be much more demand for EBM than supply, and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources.\n* Research produced by EBM, such as from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs), may not be relevant for all treatment situations.<ref name=\"pmid11489034\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Upshur RE, VanDenKerkhof EG, Goel V |title=Meaning and measurement: an inclusive model of evidence in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=91\u201396 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11489034 |issn=1356-1294 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2753.2001.00279.x}}</ref> Research tends to focus on specific populations, but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms.

It is the area between the [[end line]] and [[Goal line (gridiron football)|goal line]] bounded by the [[sidelines]].  There are two end zones, each being on an opposite side of the field. It is bordered on all sides by a white line indicating its beginning and end points, with orange, square pylons placed at each of the four corners as a visual aid (however, prior to around the early 1970s, flags were used instead to denote the end zone). Canadian rule books use the terms ''goal area'' and ''dead line'' instead of ''end zone'' and ''end line'' respectively, but the latter terms are the more common in colloquial Canadian English. Unlike sports like [[association football]] and [[ice hockey]] which require the ball/puck to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score, both Canadian and American football merely need the nose of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line.\n\nA similar concept exists in both [[rugby football]] codes, where it is known as the ''in-goal area''. The difference between rugby and gridiron-based codes is that in rugby, the ball must be touched to the ground in the in-goal area to count as a [[try]] (the rugby equivalent of a touchdown), whereas in the gridiron-based games, simply possessing the ball while it is in the end zone is sufficient to count it as a touchdown.\n\n[[Ultimate frisbee]] also uses an end zone scoring area.  Scores in this sport are counted when a pass is received in the end zone.\n\n== History ==\nThe end zones were invented as a result of the creation of the [[forward pass]]. Prior to this, the goal line and end line were the same, and players scored a [[touchdown]] by leaving the field of play through that line. Goal posts were placed on the goal line, and any kicks that did not result in field goals but left the field through the end lines were simply recorded as [[touchback]]s (or, in the Canadian game, [[single (football)|singles]]; it was during the pre-end zone era that [[Hugh Gall]] set the record for most singles in a game, with eight).\n\nIn the earliest days of the forward pass, the pass had to be caught in-bounds and could not be thrown across the goal line (as the receiver would be out of bounds). This also made it difficult to pass the ball when very close to one's own goal line, since merely dropping back to pass or kick would result in a [[safety (American football score)|safety]] (rules of the forward pass at the time required the passer to be five yards behind the line of scrimmage, which would make throwing the forward pass when the ball was snapped from behind one's own five-yard line illegal in itself).\n\nThus, in 1912, the end zone was introduced in [[American football]]. In an era when professional football was still in its early years and [[college football]] dominated the game, the resulting enlargement of the field was constrained by fact that many college teams were already playing in well-developed stadiums, complete with stands and other structures at the ends of the fields, thereby making any substantial enlargement of the field unfeasible at many schools. Eventually, a compromise was reached: 12 yards of end zone were added to each end of the field, but in return, the playing field was shortened from 110 yards to 100, resulting in the physical size of the field being only slightly longer than before. Goal posts were originally kept on the goal lines, but after they began to interfere with play, they moved back to the end lines in 1927, where they have remained in college football ever since. The National Football League moved the goal posts up to the goal line again in 1933, then back again to the end line in 1974.\n\nAs with many other aspects of gridiron football, [[Canadian football]] adopted the forward pass and end zones much later than American football.  The forward pass and end zones were adopted in 1929. In Canada, college football never reached a level of prominence comparable to U.S. college football, and professional football was still in its infancy in the 1920s.  As a result, Canadian football was still being played in rudimentary facilities in the late 1920s. A further consideration was that the [[Football Canada|Canadian Rugby Union]] (the governing body of Canadian football at the time) wanted to reduce the prominence of single points (then called ''rouges'') in the game. Therefore, the CRU simply appended 25-yard end zones to the ends of the existing 110-yard field, creating a much larger field of play. Since moving the goal posts back 25 yards would have made the scoring of field goals excessively difficult, and since the CRU did not want to reduce the prominence of field goals, the goal posts were left on the goal line where they remain today. However, the rules governing the scoring of singles were changed: teams were required to either kick the ball out of bounds through the end zone or force the opposition to down a kicked ball in their own end zone in order to be awarded a point. By 1986, at which point CFL stadiums were becoming bigger and comparable in development to their American counterparts in an effort to stay financially competitive, the CFL reduced the depth of the end zone to 20 yards.\n\n== Scoring ==\nA team scores a [[touchdown]] by entering its opponent's end zone while carrying the ball or catching the ball while being within the end zone. If the ball is carried by a player, it is considered a score when any part of the ball is directly above or beyond any part of the goal line between the pylons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/field |title=NFL Rules Digest: Field |publisher=Nfl.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> In addition, a [[two-point conversion]] may be scored after a touchdown by similar means.\n\nIn Ultimate Frisbee, a goal is scored by completing a pass into the end zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rules.wfdf.org/rules/ultimate |title=WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2013 \u2013 Introduction |publisher=wfdf.org |year=2013 |accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Size ==\nThe end zone in American football is 10 yards long by {{frac|53|1|3}} yards (160 feet) wide. Each corner is marked with a pylon.\n\nA full-sized end zone in [[Canadian football]] is 20 yards long by 65 yards wide. Prior to the 1980s, the Canadian end zone was 25 yards long. The first stadium to use the 20 yard long end zone was [[B.C. Place]] in [[Vancouver]], which was completed in 1983. The floor of B.C. Place was (and is) too short to accommodate a field 160 yards in length. The shorter end zone proved popular enough that the CFL adopted it league-wide in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfldb.ca/faq/game-rules-regulations/#what-is-the-size-of-the-cfl-field|title=FAQ about Game Rules and Regulations on CFLdb|work=cfldb.ca}}</ref> At [[BMO Field]], home to the [[Toronto Argonauts]], the end zones are only 18 yards. [https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/argos-finally-have-a-home-at-bmo-field~886589]\n\nIn Canadian football stadiums that also feature a running track, it is usually necessary to truncate the back corners of the end zones, since a rectangular field 150 yards long and 65 yards wide will not fit completely inside an oval-shaped running track. Such truncations are marked as straight diagonal lines, resulting in an end zone with six corners and six pylons. As of 2016, Montreal's [[Percival Molson Stadium]] is the only CFL stadium that has the rounded-off style end zones.\n\nDuring the CFL's [[Canadian Football League in the United States|American expansion]] in the mid-1990s, several stadiums, by necessity, used 15-yard end zones (some even shorter than 15).\n\nUltimate Frisbee uses an end zone 40 yards wide and 20 yards deep (37&nbsp;m \u00d7 18&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rules.wfdf.org/rules/ultimate/playing-field |title=Playing Field |publisher=wfdf.org |year=2013 |accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== The goal post ==\nThe location and dimensions of a goal post differ from league to league, but it is usually within the boundaries of the end zone.  In earlier football games (both professional and collegiate), the goal post began at the goal line, and was usually an H-shaped bar.  Nowadays, for player safety reasons, almost all goal posts in the professional and collegiate levels of American football are T-shaped, and reside just outside the rear of both end zones.\n\nThe goal posts in Canadian football still reside on the goal line instead of the back of the end zones, partly because the number of field goal attempts would dramatically decrease if the posts were moved 20 yards back in that sport, and also because the larger end zone and wider field makes the resulting interference in play by the goal post a less serious problem.\n\nAt the high school level, it is not uncommon to see multi-purpose goal posts that include football goal posts at the top and a [[association football|soccer]] net at the bottom; these are usually seen at smaller schools and in [[multi-purpose stadium]]s where facilities are used for multiple sports. When these or H-shaped goal posts are used in football, the lower portions of the posts are covered with several inches of heavy foam padding to protect the safety of the players.\n\n== Decoration ==\nMost professional and collegiate teams have their [[logo]], team name, or both painted on the surface of the end zone, with team colors filling the background. Many championship and bowl games at college and professional level are commemorated by the names of the opposing teams each being painted in one of the opposite end zones. In some leagues, along with bowl games, local, national, or bowl game sponsors may also have their logos placed in the end zone. In the CFL, fully painted end zones are nonexistent, though some feature club logos or sponsors. Additionally, the Canadian end zone, being a live-ball part of the field, often features yardage dashes, not unlike the field of play itself.\n\nIn many places, particularly in smaller high schools and colleges, end zones are undecorated, or have plain white diagonal stripes spaced several yards apart, in lieu of colors and decorations. One notable use of this design in higher levels is with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], who kept their diagonal-line end zone decoration at [[Heinz Field]] after positive fan reaction.\n\nOne of the quirks of the [[American Football League]] was its use of unusual patterns such as [[argyle (pattern)|argyle]] in its end zones, a tradition revived in 2009 by the [[Denver Broncos]], itself a former AFL team. The [[XFL]] standardized its playing fields so that all eight of its teams had uniform fields with the XFL logo in each end zone and no team identification.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n* [[List of college football venues with non-traditional field colors]]\n* [[Friend zone]], a play on the term\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{American football concepts}}\n\n[[Category:American football terminology]]\n[[Category:Canadian football terminology]]", "sha1": "28yyt4a79bd3c10ism71cwfyrfswbq7"}}, {"title": "Ettore Ximenes", "ns": "0", "id": "10017", "revision": {"id": "802147276", "parentid": "791653811", "timestamp": "2017-09-24T08:25:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v1.5.3)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Ettore Ximenes sculpture of Caruso.jpg|thumb|250px|Ettore Ximenes with a sculpture model of opera singer [[Enrico Caruso]].]]\n'''Ettore Ximenes''' (April 11, 1855, [[Palermo]]  &ndash; December 20, 1926, [[Rome]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] sculptor.\n\n== Biography==\nSon of [[Antonio Ximenes]] and Giulia Tolentino, a sicilian noble woman, Ettore Ximenes initially embarked on literary studies but then took up sculpture and attended the courses at the [[Palermo]] Academy of Fine Arts. After 1872, he continued training at the Naples Academy under [[Domenico Morelli]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bAAAAYAAJ  ''Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.''], by [[Angelo de Gubernatis]]. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 556.</ref> and [[Stanislao Lista]]. He also established a close relationship with [[Vincenzo Gemito]].\n\nHe returned to [[Palermo]] in 1874 and won a competition for a four-year grant, which enabled him to study and open a studio for sculpture in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]]. In 1873 at Vienna, he exhibited ''Work without Genius''. In 1877 at Naples, he exhibited a life-size statue titled ''The Equilibrium'' about a gymnast walking on a sphere. He would make copies of this work in small marble and bronze statuettes.\n\nHe exhibited a stucco ''Christ and the Adultress'' and ''Il cuore del re (Heart of the King)'', the latter depicting an oft-repeated story of King Vittorio Emanuele during one of his frequent hunts, encountering and offering charity to a peasant child. At the 1878 Paris World Exposition he displayed: ''The Brawl'' and ''il Marmiton''.<ref>Gubernatis, page 555.</ref> In [[Paris]],  he met with [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]].\n\nIn 1878, he also completed a life-size stucco of ''il Ciceruacchio'', a statue of the Italian patriot [[Angelo Brunetti]] and his thirteen-year-old son, depicting them at the moment of their execution in 1849 by Austrian troops. The Cicervacchio statue, with its tinge of revolutionary zeal, did not find commissions for completing the work in marble.<ref>Gubernatis page 556</ref>\n\nHe then completed a nude statue of ''[[Nana (novel)|Nan\u00e0]]'' based on the novel by [[\u00c9mile Zola]]; the statue was exhibited at the 1879 Salon di Paris. The next year at the Paris Salon, he displayed ''La Pesca meravigliosa'', where a fisherman rescues a bathing maiden. Returning to Italy, he displayed the bust del minister [[Giuseppe Zanardelli]]. At the Mostra of Rome, he displayed ''The assassination of Julius Caeser''; and at the Exposition of Venice, ''Ragazzi messi in fila''.<ref>Gubernatis, page 555-556.</ref> Ximenes' realism gave way to Symbolist and Neo-Renaissance elements. In addition to sculpture, he also produced illustrations for the works of [[Edmondo De Amicis]] published by the Treves publishing house.\n\nXimenes was involved in many of the major official monumental projects in [[Italy]] from the 1880s on and devoted his energies as from 1911 primarily to commissions for important public works in S\u00e3o Paulo, Kiev, New York and Buenos Aires.\n\n==Works==\n\n===In Italy===\n*Bronze [[quadriga]] on [[Palace of Justice, Rome]]\n\n===In Russia===\n* Monument to Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]] in [[Kiev]] (1911)\n* Monument to [[Pyotr Stolypin]] in [[Kiev]] (1913)\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Alexander 2 Kyiv 02.jpg|[[Alexander II of Russia]], 1911\nImage:Kyiv-stolypin-statue.jpg|[[Pyotr Stolypin]], 1913\n</gallery>\n\n===In the United States===\n* [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in [[the Battery (Manhattan)|the Battery]], Manhattan, New York, 1909<ref>[http://downtownexpress.com/de_348/100year.html 100 year] at downtownexpress.com</ref>\n* [[Dante Alighieri (Ximenes)|Dante Alighieri]] in [[Dante Park]] at [[Lincoln Center]], [[New York City]] and in [[Meridian Hill Park]], [[Washington D.C.]] - castings of the same work, 1921\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Ximenes Monument to Verrazzano in NY (1911).jpg|[[Giovanni da Verrazzano|Verrazzano Monument]], 1909\nImage:Dante (Malcolm X Park).jpg|''Dante'', [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Meridian Hill Park]]\nFile:Artgate_Fondazione_Cariplo_-_Ximenez_Ettore,_La_Repubblica_Argentina.jpg|''[[Argentina|La repubblica Argentina]]'', 1900\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Elena Lissoni, [http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/collezione-online/page45d.do?link=oln82d.redirect&kcond31d.att3=80 Ettore Ximenes], online catalogue [https://web.archive.org/web/20120402223047/http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/Portal-museo/page38.do?sp=page38&link=ln502&stu24.LanguageISOCtxParam=en Artgate] by [[Fondazione Cariplo]], 2010, CC BY-SA (source for biography).\n* Dianne Durante, ''Outdoor Monuments of Manhattan: A Historical Guide'' (New York University Press, 2007), with a discussion of the Verrazzano.\n*Fried, Frederick & Edmund V.

In [[Harlan Mills]]'s words (1986), \"programming [before the 1970s] was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program\".

However, after graduating from school in 1948, at his parents' suggestion he studied mathematics and physics and then [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Leiden]].<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, [[electronic computers]] were a novelty. Dijkstra stumbled on his career quite by accident, and through his supervisor, Professor A. Haantjes, he met [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], the director of the Computation Department at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], who offered Dijkstra a job; he officially became the Netherlands' first \"programmer\" in March 1952.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\n\nFor some time Dijkstra remained committed to physics, working on it in [[Leiden]] three days out of each week. With increasing exposure to computing, however, his focus began to shift. As he recalled:<ref name=\"ewd340\">[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W.

The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable [[theoretical physicist]], or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A [[programmer]]? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was [[Computer programming|programming]]? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on Van Wijngaarden's office door, asking him whether I could \"speak to him for a moment\"; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come?

He stated that he was a programmer, which was unacceptable to the authorities, there being no such profession at that time in The Netherlands.<ref>[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E.

His thesis supervisor was Van Wijngaarden.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>\n\n===Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam===\n\nFrom 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra worked at the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] in Amsterdam,<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> where he worked closely with [[Bram Jan Loopstra]] and [[Carel S. Scholten]], who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\nDijkstra formulated and solved the [[shortest path problem]] for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956, but\u2014because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing\u2014did not publish the result until 1959.\n\nAt the Mathematical Center, Dijkstra and his colleague {{Interlanguage link multi|Jaap Zonneveld|nl}} developed a [[compiler]] for the programming language [[ALGOL 60]]; it had a profound influence on his later thinking on programming as a scientific activity.

His duties consisted of visiting some of the company's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects \u2013 notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>\n\nThe Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles.

Many of his papers are the source of new research areas. Many concepts that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him. Several important problems were also first formulated and solved by him. A 1994 survey of over a thousand professors of computer science was conducted to obtain a list of 38 most influential scholarly papers in the field, and Dijkstra is the author of five papers.<ref>{{harvnb|Laplante|1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Peter Chen |first=Peter P. |last=Chen |title=From Goto-less to Structured Programming: The Legacy of Edsger W.

In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in teaching computer science, and in the relationships between academic computing science and the software industry.\n\n===Algorithmic work===\n[[File:Dijkstra Animation.gif|Dijkstra's algorithm runtime|thumb |Dijkstra's algorithm. It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. Mark visited (set to red) when done with neighbors.]]\n\nDijkstra's algorithmic work (especially [[graph algorithms]], [[concurrent algorithm]]s, and [[distributed algorithms]]) plays an important role in many areas of computing science. According to [[Leslie Lamport]] (2002), Dijkstra \"started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]] with his 1965 CACM paper \"Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control\", in which he first stated and solved the mutual exclusion problem.\" As Lamport explains, \"that paper is probably why [[PODC]] exists (...). It remains to this day the most influential paper in the field. That it did not win a [[PODC Influential-Paper Award|PODC Influential Paper Award]] reflects an artificial separation between concurrent and distributed algorithms\u2013a separation that has never existed in Dijkstra's work.\"<ref>[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)].</ref>\n\nIn 1959 Dijkstra published in a 3-page article 'A note on two problems in connexion with graphs' the [[algorithm]] to find the shortest path in a graph between any two given nodes, now called [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]. Its impact over the next 40 years is summarised from the article of [[Mikkel Thorup]], 'Undirected Single Source Shortest Paths with Positive Integer Weights in Linear Time' (1999): \"Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP [Single-Source Shortest Paths] for general directed and undirected graphs have been based on Dijkstra's algorithm.\" Dijkstra's algorithm is used in SPF, [[Shortest Path First]], which is used in the routing protocols [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]]. Various modifications to Dijkstra's algorithm have been proposed by many authors using [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] to reduce the run time of [[shortest path search]]. One of the most used heuristic algorithms is the [[A* search algorithm]] (first described by [[Peter E. Hart|Peter Hart]], [[Nils John Nilsson|Nils Nilsson]] and [[Bertram Raphael]] of [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in 1968),<ref name=\"nilsson\">{{cite journal\n | first = P.

Dijkstra thought about the [[shortest path problem]] when working at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]] in 1956 as a [[computer programmer|programmer]] to demonstrate capabilities of a new [[computer]] called [[ARMAC]]. His objective was to choose both a problem as well as an answer (that would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand. He designed the [[Dijkstra's algorithm|shortest path algorithm]] in about 20 minutes without aid of paper and pen and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands (so that 6 bits would suffice to represent the city in the algorithm).<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dijkstra.html Dijkstra biography]</ref> As he recalled, in an interview published in 2001:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frana | first1 = Philip L | year = 2001 | title = An Interview with Edsger W.

I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities.

The [[algorithm]] was named the \"shunting yard\" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a [[classification yard|railroad shunting yard]]. The shunting-yard algorithm is commonly used to implement [[operator-precedence parser]]s.\n\nIn 1962 or 1963 Dijkstra proposed the [[semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] mechanism for [[mutual exclusion]] algorithm for n processes (a generalization of [[Dekker's algorithm]]), which was probably the first published [[concurrent algorithm]] and which introduced a new area of algorithmic research. He also identified the [[deadlock]] problem and proposed the [[banker's algorithm]] that [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|prevents deadlock]].\n\nIn 1974 Dijkstra presented three [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing]] algorithms for [[mutual exclusion]] on a ring.

Dijkstra's name does not appear in the list of 13 authors of the final report. Apparently, he eventually left the committee because he could not agree with the majority opinions. Still, while at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam), he wrote jointly with [[Jaap Zonneveld]] the [[ALGOL 60#ALGOL 60 implementations timeline|first ALGOL 60 compiler]].

Dijkstra's short book ''Primer of Algol 60 Programming'', originally published in 1962, was the standard reference for the language for several years.\n\n===Programming paradigm and methodology===\n[[Computer programming]] in the 1950s to 1960s was not recognized as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] and unlike mature sciences there were no theoretical concepts or coding systems. Programming as a professional activity was poorly understood in those years.\n\nIn the late 1960s computer programming was in state of crisis. [[Software crisis]] is a term used in the early days of [[computing science]] for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient [[computer programs]] in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the [[software]], many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term \"software crisis\" was coined by some attendees at the first [[NATO Software Engineering Conferences|NATO Software Engineering Conference]] in 1968 at [[Garmisch]], Germany.<ref name=\"Haigh, Thomas 2010\">Haigh, Thomas (2010)</ref><ref name=\"nato\">[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/index.html Report about the NATO Software Engineering Conference dealing with the software crisis]</ref><ref name=\"nato2\">[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF \"Report on a conference sponsored by the NATO SCIENCE COMMITTEE Garmisch, Germany, 7th to 11th October 1968\"]</ref> His 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: \"The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.\"<ref name=\"ewd340\"/>\n\nWhile Dijkstra had programmed extensively in machine code in the 1950s, he came to the conclusion that in high-level languages frequent use of the [[GOTO]] statement was usually symptomatic of poor structure. In 1968 he wrote a private paper \"A Case against the GO TO Statement\",<ref>{{Cite EWD|215|A Case against the GO TO Statement}}</ref> which was then published as a letter in CACM.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dijkstra |first=E.

This letter caused a huge debate in the programming community. Some went to the length of equating good programming with the elimination of [[GO TO]]. Dijkstra refused to mention the debate, or even the GO TO statement, in his article \"Notes on Structured Programming\". The debate has long since died down; programming languages provide alternatives to the GO TO, few programmers today use it liberally, and most never use it at all.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\n\nDijkstra's thesis was that departures from linear control flow were clearer if allowed only in disciplined higher-level structures such as the [[Conditional (computer programming)|if-then-else]] statement and the [[while loop]]. This methodology was developed into [[structured programming|structured programming movement]], the title of his 1972 book, coauthored with [[C.A.R. Hoare]] and [[Ole-Johan Dahl]]. Considered by many as the first significant movement in history of computer programming, structured programming became the new programming orthodoxy during the 1970s.<ref>[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] (1974)</ref><ref>[[Harlan Mills|Mills, Harlan D.]] (1986).

''Up and Running with C++''. (Springer), p. 1</ref>\n\nIn his article ''Structured Programming: Retrospect and Prospect'' (1986), [[Harlan Mills]] writes, \"Edsger W. Dijkstra's 1969 ''Structured Programming'' article precipitated a decade of intense focus on programming techniques that has fundamentally altered human expectations and achievements in [[software development]]. Before this decade of intense focus, programming was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program. After this decade, programming could be regarded as a public, mathematics-based activity of restructuring specifications into programs. Before, the challenge was in getting programs to run at all, and then in getting them further debugged to do the right things. After, programs could be expected to both run and do the right things with little or no debugging. Before, it was common wisdom that no sizable program could be error-free. After, many sizable programs have run a year or more with no errors detected. These expectations and achievements are not universal because of the inertia of industrial practices. But they are well-enough established to herald fundamental change in software development.\"\n\nThe book ''Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science'' (2004), edited by Edwin D. Reilly, notes that \"the major contributions of structured programming have been twofold\u2014the elevation of programming technique to something less of an art and more of a science, and the demonstration that carefully structured programs can be creative works of sufficient literary merit to deserve being read by humans and not just by computer.\"<ref>Reilly, Edwin D.

The techniques of [[structured analysis]] and [[structured design]] are outgrowths of [[structured programming]] concepts and techniques, and of the early ideas about modular design. Principles of modularity were strengthened by [[Larry Constantine]]'s concepts of [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]] (to be minimized between modules) and [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]] (to be maximized within modules), by [[David Parnas]]'s techniques of [[information hiding]], and by [[abstract data types]].<ref>Selby, Richard W. (2007). ''Software Engineering: Barry W. Boehm's Lifetime Contributions to Software Development, Management, and Research''. (IEEE Computer Society), pp. 701\u2013702</ref> A number of tools and methods employing [[structured analysis|structured concepts]] were developed, such as [[Structured Design]], [[Jackson Structured Programming|Jackson's Structured Programming]], [[Douglas T.

''Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere'', 2nd Edition (IBM Press), p. 5. As Kyle Brown, Greg Hester, et al. (2003) notes, \"Most experienced IT professionals will agree that developing and adhering to a standard architecture is key to the success of large-scale software development. Computer pioneer Edsger Dijkstra validated this notion when he developed THE operating system in 1968. Since then, layered architectures have proved their viability in technological domains, such as hardware and networking. Layering has proved itself in the operating system domain; however, the same benefits are available when applied to e-commerce or to thin client\u2013oriented applications. Layered architectures have become essential in supporting the iterative development process by promoting reusability, scalability, and maintainability.\"</ref> His 1968 article on this subject provided the foundation for subsequent designs of the operating systems. The IEEE Computer Society's [[David Alan Grier (writer)|David Alan Grier]] writes, \"We generally trace the idea of building computer systems in layers back to a 1967 paper that the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra gave to a joint IEEE Computer Society/ACM conference. Prior to this paper, engineers had struggled with the problem of how to organize software. If you look at early examples of programs, and you can find many in the electronic library of the Computer Society, you will find that most code of that era is complicated, difficult to read, hard to modify, and challenging to reuse. In his 1967 paper, Dijkstra described how software could be constructed in layers and gave an example of a simple operating system that used five layers. He admitted that this system might not be a realistic test of his ideas but he argued that the \"larger the project, the more essential the structuring!\" The idea of using layers to control complexity has become a mainstay of software architecture. We see it in many forms and apply it to many problems. We see it in the hierarchy of classes in object-oriented programming and in the structure of [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] (SOA). SOA is a relatively recent application of layering in computer science. It was articulated in 2007 as a means of controlling complexity in business systems, especially distributed systems that make substantial use of the Internet. Like Dijkstra's plan for system development, its layering system is called the SOA Solution Stack or S3. The S3's nine layers are: 1) operational systems, 2) service components, 3) services, 4) business processes, 5) consumer actions, 6) system integration, 7) quality control and assurance, 8) information architecture, and 9) system governance and policies.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.computer.org/web/closer-than-you-might-think/layers-upon-layers |author=Grier, David Alan |title=Closer Than You Might Think: Layers upon Layers |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDijkstra organized the design of the system in layers in order to reduce the overall complexity of the software. Though the term 'architecture' had not yet been used to describe [[software design]], this was certainly considered the first glimpse of [[software architecture]].<ref name=Albin03/> It introduced a number of design principles which have become part of the working vocabulary of every professional programmer: levels of abstraction, programming in layers, the semaphore, and [[cooperating sequential processes]]. His original paper on the THE operating system was reprinted in the 25th Anniversary issue of Communications of the ACM, in January 1983. By way of introduction, the Editor-in-Chief says, \"This project initiated a long line of research in multilevel systems architecture \u2014 a line that continues to the present day because hierarchical modularity is a powerful approach to organizing large systems.\"<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\n\n===Concurrent computing and programming===\n[[File:Rail-semaphore-signal-Dave-F.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] ({{lang-nl|seinpaal}}, the term used in Dijkstra's original description<ref>{{Cite EWD|74|Over seinpalen}}</ref>).

(Springer), {{ISBN|978-3-642-32027-9}}</ref> Michel Raynal writes, \"Since the early work of E.W. Dijkstra (1965), who introduced the mutual exclusion problem, the concept of a process, the semaphore object, the notion of a [[weakest precondition]], and [[guarded commands]] (among many other contributions), [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] is no longer a catalog of tricks but a domain of computing science with its own concepts, mechanisms, and techniques whose results can be applied in many domains. This means that process synchronization has to be a major topic of any computer science curriculum.\"\n\nJohn W. McCormick et al. (2011) notes, \"The notion of the [[concurrent program]] as a means for writing [[parallel program]]s without regard for the underlying hardware was first introduced by Edsger Dijkstra (1968). [[Moti Ben-Ari]] (1982) elegantly summed up Dijkstra's idea in three sentences: \u2018Concurrent programming is the name given to programming notation and techniques for expressing potential parallelism and solving the resulting synchronization and communication problems. Implementation of parallelism is a topic in computer systems (hardware and software) that is essentially independent of concurrent programming. Concurrent programming is important because it provides an abstract setting in which to study parallelism without getting bogged down in the implementation details.\u2019\"<ref>{{cite book |last=McCormick |first=John W. |last2=Singhoff |first2=Frank |last3=Hugues |first3=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Building Parallel, Embedded, and Real-Time Applications with Ada |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |year=2011 |isbn= |pages=5 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Distributed computing===\nDijkstra was one of the very early pioneers of the research on principles of [[distributed computing]].<ref>[http://www.podc.org/dijkstra Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]. The citation for the prize reads: \"The [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]] is named for Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930\u20132002), a pioneer in the area of distributed computing. His foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built. No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/dijkstra-prize Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (EATCS International Symposium on Distributed Computing)]</ref> As the citation for the [[Dijkstra Prize]] recognizes, \"no other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing.\" Some of his papers are even considered to be those that established the field. Dijkstra's 1965 paper, ''Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control'' was the first to present the correct solution to the [[mutual exclusion]] problem. [[Leslie Lamport]] writes that this work \"is probably why [[PODC]] exists\" and it \"started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]]\".<ref>[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]</ref>\n\nIn particular, his paper \"Self-stabilizing Systems in Spite of Distributed Control\" (1974) started the sub-field of [[self-stabilization]]. It is also considered as the first scientific examination of [[fault-tolerant systems]].<ref name=\"Lamport (2015)\"/> Dijkstra's paper was not widely noticed until Leslie Lamport's invited talk at the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] ([[PODC]]) in 1983. In his report on Dijkstra's work on [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing]] [[distributed systems]], Lamport regard it to be 'a milestone in work on [[fault tolerance]]' and 'a very fertile field for research'.<ref>{{harvnb|Dolev|2000|page=3}}</ref>\n\n===Formal specification and verification===\n\nFrom the 1970s, Dijkstra's chief interest was [[formal verification]]. In 1976 Dijkstra published a seminal book, ''A Discipline of Programming'', which put forward his method of systematic development of programs together with their correctness proofs. In his exposition he used his '[[Guarded Command Language]]'. The language, with its reliance on non-determinism, the adopted [[weakest precondition]] [[Predicate transformer semantics|semantics]] and the proposed development method has had a considerable impact on the field to this day. The [[refinement calculus]], originally proposed by [[Ralph-Johan Back]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Ralph-Johan |last=Back |first2=Joakim |last2=Wright |title=Refinement Calculus: A Systematic Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAEMCAAAQBAJ |origyear=1978 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4612-1674-2 |series=Texts in Computer Science |ref=harv}}</ref> and developed by [[Carroll Morgan (computer scientist)|Carroll Morgan]],<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Carroll |editor-last=Morgan |editor2-first=Trevor |editor2-last=Vickers |title=On the Refinement Calculus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FPSBwAAQBAJ |date=2012 |origyear=1992 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4471-3273-8}}</ref> is an extension of Dijkstra's [[weakest precondition calculus]], where program statements are modeled as [[Predicate transformer semantics|predicate transformers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Back|Wright|1978|page=v}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, to add further support to this approach to programming, he published jointly with Wim Feijen an introductory textbook for first-year students of computer science. The book, first published in Dutch, was entitled ''Een methode van programmeren''. The English edition appeared in 1988 as ''A Method of Programming''.\n\n===On the nature of computer science and computer programming===\nMany of his opinions on computer science and programming have become widespread. For example, the programming phrase \"two or more, use a for\" (a rule of thumb when to use a loop) is sometimes attributed to him.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Recursion in Grammar and Performance|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05086-7_8|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 978-3-319-05085-0|pages = 159\u2013177|series = Studies in Theoretical Psycholinguistics|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-05086-7_8|language = en|first = Edward P.|last = Stabler|editor-first = Tom|editor-last = Roeper|editor-first2 = Margaret|editor-last2 = Speas}}</ref>\n\nHe was the first to make the claim that programming is so inherently complex that, in order to manage it successfully, programmers need to harness every trick and abstraction possible.\n\nDijkstra was one of the most famous opponents of the engineering view of computing science. Like [[Peter Naur]] and [[Kristen Nygaard]], Dijkstra disliked the very term 'computer science'. [[Computer science]], as Dijkstra pointed out, deserves a better name. He suggests it can be called 'computing science'. Instead of the computer, or computing technology, Dijkstra wanted to emphasize the abstract mechanisms that computing science uses to master complexity. When expressing the abstract nature of [[computing science]], he wrote,\n\n{{quote|A confusion of even longer standing came from the fact that the unprepared included the electronic engineers that were supposed to design, build and maintain the machines. The job was actually beyond the [[electronic technology]] of the day, and, as a result, the question of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition became in the early days the all-overriding concern. As a result, the topic became \u2013 primarily in the USA \u2013 prematurely known as \u2018[[computer science]]\u2019 \u2013 which, actually, is like referring to [[surgery]] as \u2018knife science\u2019 \u2013 and it was firmly implanted in people's minds that [[computing science]] is about machines and their peripheral equipment. Quod non [Latin: \"Which is not true\"]. We now know that electronic technology has no more to contribute to [[computing]] than the physical equipment. We now know that [[programmable computer]] is no more and no less than an extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism without changing a single wire, and that the core challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one, viz., what (abstract) mechanisms we can conceive without getting lost in the complexities of our own making.<ref>{{cite EWD|924|On a cultural gap}}{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=E.W.|title=On a cultural gap|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|year=1986|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD924.html|doi=10.1007/bf03023921}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''The Humble Programmer'' (1972), Dijkstra wrote: \"We must not forget that it is not our [computing scientists'] business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour.\"\n\nDijkstra also opposed the inclusion of [[software engineering]] under the umbrella of academic computer science. He wrote that, \"As economics is known as \"The Miserable Science\", software engineering should be known as \"The Doomed Discipline\", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory.\" And \"software engineering has accepted as its charter \"How to program if you cannot.\".\"<ref>{{Cite EWD|1036|On the cruelty of really teaching computer science}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and working style==\n[[File:Edsger Dijkstra 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Dijkstra at the blackboard during a conference at [[ETH Zurich]] in 1994]]\n{{Cquote|(...) You can hardly blame [[M.I.T.]] for not taking notice of an obscure computer scientist in a small town in the Netherlands.|200px||Dijkstra used to describe himself, in [[Nuenen]] in the mid-1960s.<ref>Shasha, Dennis; Lazere, Cathy: ''Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists''. (New York, NY: Springer, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-387-98269-4}}), p. 64</ref><ref name=\"DijkstraNYT\"/>}}\nIn the world of computing science, Dijkstra is well known as a \"character\". In the preface of his book ''A Discipline of Programming'' (1976) he stated the following: \"For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology.\" In fact, most of his articles and books have no references at all.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> This approach to references was deplored by some researchers. But Dijkstra chose this way of working to preserve his self-reliance.\n\nAs a university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> His approach to teaching was unconventional.<ref>Irfan Hyder, Syed (2013)</ref> His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin had little to do with computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> At the beginning of each [[semester]] he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a [[textbook]], with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\n\nHe was also highly original in his way of assessing people's capacity for a job. When [[Vladimir Lifschitz]] came to Austin in 1990 for a job interview, Dijkstra gave him a puzzle. Vladimir solved it and has been working in Austin since then.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>\n\nDespite having invented much of the technology of software, Dijkstra eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues' encouragement and acquired a [[Macintosh]] [[computer]], he used it only for [[e-mail]] and for browsing the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name=\"UTx\">{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | format = memorial | url = http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Dijkstra/dijkstra.html | title = In Memoriam Edsger Wybe Dijkstra}}.</ref> Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his [[typewriter]] and later on his [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]] pen.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> Dijkstra's favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterst\u00fcck [[fountain pen]]. He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.\n\nHe had no use for [[word processors]], believing that one should be able to write a letter or article without rough drafts, rewriting, or any significant editing. He would work it all out in his head before putting [[pen]] to paper, and once mentioned that when he was a physics student he would solve his homework problems in his head while walking the streets of [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>\nMost of Dijkstra's publications were written by him alone. He never had a secretary and took care of all his correspondence alone.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> When colleagues prepared a [[Festschrift]] for his sixtieth birthday, published by [[Springer-Verlag]], he took the trouble to thank each of the 61 contributors separately, in a hand-written letter.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>\n\nThroughout Dijkstra's career, his work was characterized by elegance and economy.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to a small group of colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists.<ref>Istrail, Sorin (Brown Univesirty Department of Computer Science Alumni Magazine, Vol 17.2, 2008)</ref> His love affair with [[simplicity]] came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.<ref name=\"Denken_als_Discpline\">{{cite web|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Edsger|title=Denken als Discipline|url=http://www.vpro.nl/speel.POMS_VPRO_212868.html|website=VPRO|publisher=Noorderlicht|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nDijkstra was famous for his wit, eloquence, and way with words, such as in his remark, \"The question of whether Machines Can Think (\u2026) is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.\"<ref>{{Cite EWD|898|The threats to computing science}}</ref>; his advice to a promising researcher, who asked how to select a topic for research, \"Do only what only you can do\".<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> Dijkstra was also known for his vocal criticism. As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly opposed the teaching of [[BASIC]].<ref name=\"EWD498\">{{Cite EWD|498|How do we tell truths that might hurt?}}</ref>\n\nIn many of his more humorous essays, Dijkstra described a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having [[commercialized]] the production of mathematical [[theorems]] in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs.  He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] but then had great difficulties collecting [[royalties]] from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a [[trade secret]].<ref name=\"Cite EWD|475\">{{Cite EWD|475}}</ref> Many of the company's proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company's effort had to be spent on [[Software maintenance|maintenance]].<ref>{{Cite EWD|539}}</ref> A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for [[Pythagoras' Theorem]], that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs.<ref>{{Cite EWD |427}}</ref> Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as \"the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived\".<ref name=\"Cite EWD|475\"/> EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.<ref>{{Cite EWD|443}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Dijkstra | first = Edsger W | title = Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-387-90652-2 }}</ref>\n\n==EWD manuscripts==\nDijkstra was well known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his [[fountain pen]]. The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with ''EWD'', his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in [[Amsterdam]] to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to [[Eindhoven]], Dijkstra experienced a [[writer's block]] for more than a year. Dijkstra distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ | title = Online EWD archive}}.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nDijkstra's self-confidence went together with a remarkably modest [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], to the point of being [[:wikt:spartan|spartan]].<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> His and his wife's house in [[Nuenen]] was simple, small and unassuming. He did not own a TV, a VCR or a mobile telephone, and did not go to the movies.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> In contrast, he played the piano well and, while in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], liked to go to [[concert]]s.

The award was first approved in 1969 and the first election was made in 1971 to Dijkstra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roll of Distinguished Fellows |url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1650 |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |accessdate=2014-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025814/http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1650 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nOn the occasion of Dijkstra's 60th birthday in 1990, The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin organized a two-day seminar in his honor. Speakers came from all over the United States and Europe, and a group of computer scientists contributed research articles which were edited into a book.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Feijen|Gries|1990}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the C&C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra \"for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores.\" Dijkstra was alive to receive notice of the award, but it was accepted by his family in an award ceremony after his death.\n\nShortly before his death in 2002, Dijkstra received the ACM [[PODC Influential-Paper Award]] in [[distributed computing]] for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the [[Dijkstra Prize]] ([[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]]) the following year, in his honor.\n\nThe Dijkstra Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement in Computer Science ([[Loyola University Chicago]], Department of Computer Science) is named for Edsger W. Dijkstra. Beginning in 2005, this award recognizes the top academic performance by a graduating computer science major. Selection is based on GPA in all major courses and election by department faculty.<ref>[http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/awards/ Awards: Loyola University Chicago]</ref>\n\nThe Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin hosted the inaugural Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture on 12 October 2010. [[Tony Hoare]], Emeritus Professor at Oxford and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, was the speaker for the event. This lecture series was made possible by a generous grant from Schlumberger to honor the memory of Dijkstra.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]\n* [[Dining philosophers problem]]\n* [[Guarded Command Language]]\n* [[Predicate transformer semantics]]\n* [[Weakest precondition calculus]]\n* [[Semaphore (programming)|Semaphore]]\n* [[Smoothsort]]\n* ''[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]''\n* ''[[On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science]]''\n* [[List of pioneers in computer science]]\n* [[List of important publications in computer science]]\n* [[List of important publications in theoretical computer science]]\n* [[List of important publications in concurrent, parallel, and distributed computing]]\n\n==Publications==\nBooks:\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |author-mask=1 |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |title=A Primer of ALGOL 60 Programming: Together with Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 |publisher=Academic Press |location= |year=1962 |isbn=0122162501 }}\n* {{cite book |author-mask=1\n | last=Dijkstra |first=Edsger W. |author2-link=Ole-Johan Dahl |last2=Dahl |first2=Ole-Johan |author3-link=Tony Hoare |last3=Hoare |first3=C.A.R.\n |      year = 1972\n |     title = Structured Programming\n | publisher = [[Academic Press]]\n |        isbn = 0-12-200550-3 |ref=harv\n}}\n*{{cite book |author-mask=1 |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |title=A Discipline of Programming |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |year=1976 |isbn=013215871X }}\n*{{cite book |author-mask=1 |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |title=Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective |publisher=Springer |location= |year=1982 |isbn=0387906525 |series=Monographs in Computer Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y54ACAAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book  |author-mask=1 |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |last2=Feijen |first2=W.H.J. |last3=Sterringa |first3=Joke  |title=A Method of Programming |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location= |year=1988 |isbn=0201175363 |pages= |url=}}\n*{{cite book |author-mask=1 |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |author2-link=Carel S.

[[Perennialist]]s believe that one should teach the things that are of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere, and that the emphasis should be on principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, rather than machines or techniques, and liberal rather, than vocational topics.\n\nAlthough perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces{{what?|date=December 2017}} themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, involves a balance between teacher activity and student activity, with the teacher promoting discussion.\n\n==Secular perennialism==\nThe word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.\n\nSecular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common oriented base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.<ref>Travers, Paul D. and Ronald W. Rebore. ''Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher''. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: 1990. P. 66.</ref> They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the occidental oriented tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.\n\nAdler states: <blockquote>\n... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.<ref>Adler, Mortimer J. [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm \"Reforming Education \u2014 No Quick Fix\"]. ''The Radical Academy''.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHutchins writes in the same vein: <blockquote>\nThe business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to \"our\" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...<ref name=\"Hutchins\">Hutchins, Robert Maynard. ''Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education''. Simon & Schuster, New York: 1954.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history's finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.<ref>Kneller, George F. ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Education''. John Wiley & Sons: 1971.</ref> Adler states: \"The three R's, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.\"<ref>Adler: op. cit., p. 62</ref>\n\nSecular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world's finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the \"[[Great Conversation]]\" of humanity with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of \"[[genius]]\". Hutchins remarks:\n\n<blockquote>Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/></blockquote>\n\nIt is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nPerennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the \"uneducated\" and the \"educated\" is so slight.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins's book ''The Higher Learning in America'' deplored the \"plight of higher learning\" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in ''The Social Frontier'' which began by applauding Hutchins' attack on \"the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.<ref>Erlich, Thomas. \"Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round\". ''Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America''. Ed. Robert Orril. College Entrance Examination Board, New York: 1997.</ref>\n\nPerennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.\n\nWhile the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.\n\nPerennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.\n\n==Religious perennialism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] -->\nPerennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]'' (''The Teacher'').\n\nIn the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a defense of religious perennialism in ''The Idea of a University''. Discourse 5 of that work, \"Knowledge Its Own End\", is a recent statement of a Christian educational perennialism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html|title=Discourse 5. Knowledge its Own End|last=Newman|first=John Henry|website=The National Institute for Newman Studies|access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options. The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table:\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"25\" cellpadding=\"25\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! Idealistic Rationalism\n! Realistic Rationalism\n|- \n! Idealistic Fideism\n!

Students may pursue an optional extension to this core curriculum in later years.\n* [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] is a secular liberal arts college with an undergraduate program described as \"an all-required course of study based on the great books of the Western tradition\".\n* The [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], is another example of a well-known example of educational perennialism. \n* The [[University of Chicago]]'s Common Core, established by [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] is another well-known example of educational perennialism. Similar to [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], it is an uncommon example of an educational perennialistic college within a large research institution. \n* Integral Program at [[Saint Mary's College of California]] in [http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/undergraduate/programs_by_school/school_of_liberal_arts/programs/integral/] is a [[Great Books]] major at the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Lasallian]] Catholic liberal arts college in [[Moraga, California]]. The program was designed with the assistance of faculty from St. John's College, U.S.\n* [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in [[Santa Paula, California]] is a Catholic Christian college with a Great Books curriculum. The college was founded by a group of graduates and professors of the Integral Program at Saint Mary's College of California, who were discouraged by the liberalism that became common place among the faculty and administration on Saint Mary's campus shortly after [[Vatican II]].\n* [[Gutenberg College]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] provides \"a broad-based liberal arts education in a Protestant Christian environment\", with a \"great books\" curriculum emphasizing \"the development of basic learning skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and critical thinking) and the application of these skills to profound writings of the past\".\n* [[Shimer College]] in [[Chicago]] grants a Bachelor of Arts to students who complete a program composed of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, integrative studies and a capstone senior thesis.\n* The Torrey Honors Institute at [[Biola University]] is a Christian Great Books program.\n* [[George Wythe University]] in [[Cedar City, Utah]], is an unaccredited [[liberal arts]] school.\n* [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/ Thomas More College] in Merrimack, New Hampshire is a Catholic College with an integrated [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/academics/course-descriptions/ Liberal Arts curriculum].

History of MDMA}}</ref> In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to [[adrenaline]] or [[ephedrine]], the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on [[vascular smooth muscle]] tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no \"local effect at the eye\". MDMA was also found to have effects on [[blood sugar]] levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Research was stopped \"particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine\", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.<ref name=\"pmid17152992\"/>\n\nOutside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA. In 1953 and 1954, the [[United States Army]] commissioned a study of [[toxicity]] and behavioral effects in animals injected with [[mescaline]] and several analogues, including MDMA.
