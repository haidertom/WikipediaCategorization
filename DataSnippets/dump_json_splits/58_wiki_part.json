He established the [[Sound Dues]] in 1429, meaning all foreign ships passing through the strait had to pay a toll, which constituted up to two-thirds of Denmark's state income. With this income [[Eric of Pomerania]] built the castle Krogen. The castle was expanded in the 1580s and renamed [[Kronborg]].  All ships had to stop in Helsing\u00f8r to get their cargo taxed and pay a toll to the Danish Crown, but it also generated a significant trade for the town. In 1672 Helsing\u00f8r had grown into the third biggest town in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byhistorie.dk/filer/Byhistorie1300aar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Danske byers historie gennem 1300 \u00e5r|website=Byhistorie.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>  \n[[Johan Isaksson Pontanus]]  (''Rerum Danicarum Historica'', 1631) attributes a long and partially fictitious history to Helsing\u00f8r.\n\nThe [[Sound Dues]] were abolished in 1857 with the [[1857 Copenhagen Convention|Copenhagen Convention]], where all naval nations agreed to pay a one-time fee.\n\nThe oldest known fortified building of Helsing\u00f8r is ''Flynderborg'', an early medieval fortress situated on a hill just south of the medieval city.\nAround 1200, the first church, [[Saint Olaf's Church, Helsing\u00f8r|Saint Olaf's Church]], was built.<ref name=\"TouristBoard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visithelsingor.dk/ENGELSK/mainmenu.html|title=Helsing\u00f8r Turistbureau - Victoria Design|website=Visithelsingor.dk|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> \nA number of convents once surrounded the church, but now all that remains is the church building, today the cathedral of the [[Diocese of Helsing\u00f8r]].

It officially opened on 26 May 2013, intended to appeal to tourists with an interest in culture. The main attraction of [[Kulturhavn Kronborg]] is [[Kronborg Castle]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Besides the historical attractions of the site, [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'' is performed annually in its courtyard since 1937. There is a longstanding tradition of performing the play in English, and notable actors in the title role have included [[Laurence Olivier]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Derek Jacobi]], and in 2009 [[Jude Law]]. At the heart of [[Kulturhavn Kronborg]] lies [[kulturv\u00e6rftet]] or The Culture Yard, a new cultural centre and a public library located in the old [[:da:Helsing\u00f8r Skibsv\u00e6rft og Maskinbyggeri|dockyard]]. It opened in 2010. The former [[dry dock]] now houses the [[Danish Maritime Museum]].\n\nIn the centre of the harbour basin stands the polished steel sculpture ''Han'' (''He'') by artist duo [[Elmgreen and Dragset]], commissioned by the City of Helsing\u00f8r in 2012. It was inaugurated by then Minister of culture, [[Uffe Elb\u00e6k]], in June 2012. It is seen as the counterpart (and even little brother) to [[Edvard Eriksen]]'s world-famous ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue in [[Copenhagen]], and has caused both praise and protests among locals.\n\nThe Swedish city of [[Helsingborg]] lies a short distance across the [[\u00d8resund]] from Helsing\u00f8r, approximately {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}}.

He worked for a firm that made [[telegraph]] equipment for the Swedish government agency [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]]. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend [[Carl Johan Andersson]] in central [[Stockholm]] and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag.<ref name=\"BizHistory\"/>\n\nAlso in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. He bought a number of [[Siemens]] telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]] and [[Swedish State Railways]]. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as [[Rikstelefon]] to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or [[Royalties|royalty]] problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nEricsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to [[Scandinavia]]. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of [[brass]], [[wire]], [[ebonite]], and [[magnet]] steel. Much of the [[walnut]] wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.\n\nStockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other [[Nordic countries]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called ''Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag'' in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into ''Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn 1884, a multiple-[[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] manual [[telephone exchange]] was mostly copied from a design by C.&nbsp;E. Scribner at [[Western Electric]]. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held [[patent]] 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather \"inspiration\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn 1884, a technician named Anton Av\u00e9n at ''Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag'' combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named ''The [[Telephone magneto|Dachshund]]''.\n\n===International expansion===\n[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01536.00001(1).jpg|thumb|upright|An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of [[Nottingham]], England, it is now in the collection of [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]].]]\n\nAs production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK ([[Ericsson Telephones Ltd.]]) and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the [[National Telephone Company]] was a major customer; by 1897 sold 28% of its output in the UK. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.<ref name=\"BizHistory\"/>\n\nOther countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. [[Mass production]] techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Bobs%20phones/Pages/SwedEricsson/EricssonCradles.htm |title=Ericsson Cradles |website=Bobs Phones Page |accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, [[KBR (company)|Kellogg]] and [[Automatic Electric]] dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.\n\n===Automatic equipment===\n[[File:Ericsson telefonplan 20050902 001.jpg|thumb|right|LM Ericsson's former headquarters at [[Telefonplan]] in Stockholm, see LM Ericsson building]]\n\nEricsson ignored the growth of [[automatic telephony]] in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.<ref name=\"BizHistory\"/> [[World War I]], the subsequent [[Great Depression]], and the loss of its Russian assets after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolution]] slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Shareholding changes===\nThe acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by [[Ivar Kreuger]], an international financier. The company was renamed ''Telefon AB LM Ericsson''. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.<ref name=\"BizHistory\"/>\n\nIn 1928, Ericsson began issuing \"A\" and \"B\" shares; an \"A\" share had 1000 votes against a \"B\" share.  Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few \"A\" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of \"B\" shares, while maintaining the ''status quo'' of power distribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1930, a second issue of \"B\"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with [[collateral (finance)|security]] given in German state [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].  He then took a loan for his own company [[Kreuger & Toll]] from [[ITT Corporation]] (administered by [[Sosthenes Behn]]), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEricsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11 million{{clarify|reason=which currency?|date=January 2016}} on the deal.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nKreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Wallenberg era begins===\nEricsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]] (now [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]]) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the [[Wallenberg family]], and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson \"A\" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family arranged with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.<ref name=\"BizHistory\"/>\n\n===Market development===\n[[File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931 sv.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite.

The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.<ref name=\"BizHistory\"/>\n\nNegotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and [[switchgear]]. The [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSales drives resumed after the [[Great Depression]], but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Further development===\nEricsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, [[MTD (mobile network)#MTA|MTA]], in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/19883.php |title=Ericsson Celebrates 50 Years of Mobile Telephony |website=Cellular-news.com |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref> It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s.

Ericsson [[crossbar switching]] equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  In 1983 the company introduced the [[ERIPAX]] suite of network products and services.\n\n===1995\u20132003: emergence of the Internet===\nIn the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Internet and the New World|url=http://www.ericssonhistory.com/changing-the-world/Big-bang/The-internet-and-the-new-world-/|website=History of Ericsson}}</ref>  But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas \u2013 Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems \u2013 \"we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)\".<ref name=\"ericsson.com\">{{cite web|title=Annual Report 1996|website=Ericsson|url=https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/investors/documents/financial-reports-and-filings/annual-reports/annualreport1996_en.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[GSM]], which became a ''de facto'' world standard, combined with Ericsson's other mobile standards, such as [[D-AMPS]] and [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world's mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million [[AXE telephone exchange|AXE]] lines in place or on order in 117 countries.<ref name=\"ericsson.com\"/> Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as [[GPRS]] (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a [[3G]] mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the [[WCDMA]] (wideband [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called [[FOMA]]. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer [[Qualcomm]] promoted the alternative system [[CDMA2000]], building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999<ref>{{cite web|title=Ericsson/Qualcomm bitter feud ends|date=29 March 1999|first=Nancy|last=Gohring|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud/|website=Connected Planet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109040128/http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud|archivedate=9 January 2014}}</ref>  when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm's wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.<ref>{{cite news|title=Short Take: Qualcomm, Ericsson finalize CDMA agreement |url=http://news.cnet.com/Short-Take-Qualcomm,-Ericsson-finalize-CDMA-agreement/2110-1033_3-226260.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018160816/https://www.cnet.com/news/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-10-18 |work=[[CNET]] }}</ref>\n\nOnce the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet.

Considering the natural behaviours of different species or breeds enables the trainer to select the individuals best suited to perform the required task. It also enables the trainer to encourage the performance of naturally occurring behaviours and also the discontinuance of undesirable behaviours.<ref name=\"McGreevyBoakes2011\">{{cite book |last1=McGreevy |first1=Paul |author2=Boakes, Robert |title=Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AG_fdrmUKroC&pg=PR11 |accessdate=9 September 2016 |year=2011 |publisher=Darlington Press |isbn=978-1-921364-15-0 |pages=xi\u201323}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''ethology'' derives from the [[Greek language]]: [[wiktionary:\u1f26\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 |\u1f26\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2]], ''[[ethos]]'' meaning \"character\" and {{lang |grc |[[wiktionary:-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 |-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia |-logia]]'' meaning \"the study of\".

In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[George Romanes]], who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an [[anthropomorphism |anthropomorphic]] method, [[anecdotal cognitivism]], that did not gain scientific support.\n\nOther early ethologists, such as Charles O. Whitman, [[Oskar Heinroth]], Wallace Craig and [[Julian Huxley]], instead concentrated on behaviours that can be called instinctive, or natural, in that they occur in all members of a species under specified circumstances. Their beginning for studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an [[ethogram]] (a description of the main types of behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence).This provided an objective, cumulative database of behaviour, which subsequent researchers could check and supplement.<ref name=insectbehavior/>\n\n=== Growth of the field ===\nDue to the work of [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Niko Tinbergen]], ethology developed strongly in continental Europe during the years prior to [[World War II]].<ref name=insectbehavior /> After the war, Tinbergen moved to the [[University of Oxford]], and ethology became stronger in the [[United Kingdom |UK]], with the additional influence of [[William Homan Thorpe |William Thorpe]], [[Robert Hinde]], and [[Patrick Bateson]] at the Sub-department of Animal Behaviour of the [[University of Cambridge]], located in the village of [[Madingley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bateson |first=P. |title=The Development and Integration of Behaviour: Essays in Honour of Robert Hinde |page=479 |isbn=978-0-521-40709-0 |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> In this period, too, ethology began to develop strongly in [[North America]].\n\nLorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1973 for their work of developing ethology.<ref>{{cite book |author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title=Yearbook of science and the future |year=1975 |page=248}}</ref>\n\nEthology is now a well-recognized scientific discipline, and has a number of journals covering developments in the subject, such as ''[[Animal Behaviour (journal) |Animal Behaviour]]'', ''[[Animal Welfare (journal) |Animal Welfare]]'', ''[[Applied Animal Behaviour Science]]'', ''[[Animal Cognition]]'', ''[[Behaviour (journal) |Behaviour]]'', ''[[Behavioral Ecology (journal) |Behavioral Ecology]]'' and ''[[Journal of Ethology (journal) |Journal of Ethology]]''. In 1972, the [http://ishe.org/ International Society for Human Ethology] was founded to promote exchange of knowledge and opinions concerning human behaviour gained by applying ethological principles and methods and published their journal, ''[http://ishe.org/human-ethology-bulletin/ The Human Ethology Bulletin]''. In 2008, in a paper published in the journal ''Behaviour'', ethologist Peter Verbeek introduced the term \"Peace Ethology\" as a sub-discipline of Human Ethology that is concerned with issues of human conflict, conflict resolution, reconciliation, war, peacemaking, and peacekeeping behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Verbeek | first1=Peter | year=2008 | title=Peace Ethology | journal=Behaviour | volume=145 | issue=11 | pages=1497\u20131524 | doi=10.1163/156853908786131270}}</ref>\n\nToday, along with ethologists, many biologists, zoologists, primatologists, anthropologists, veterinarians, and physicians study ethology and other related fields such as animal psychology, the study of animal social groups, animal cognition and [[animal welfare science]].\n\n=== Social ethology and recent developments ===\nIn 1970, the [[England|English]] ethologist John H. Crook published an important paper in which he distinguished comparative ethology from social ethology, and argued that much of the ethology that had existed so far was really comparative ethology\u2014examining animals as individuals\u2014whereas, in the future, ethologists would need to concentrate on the behaviour of social groups of animals and the social structure within them.\n\nAlso in 1970, [[Robert Ardrey]]'s book ''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder'' was published. The book and study investigated animal behaviour and then compared human behaviour to it as a similar phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ardrey |first=Robert |title=The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder |year=1970 |publisher=Atheneum}}</ref>\n\n[[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' appeared in 1975,<ref name=WilsonSociobiology/> and since that time, the study of behaviour has been much more concerned with social aspects. It has also been driven by the stronger, but more sophisticated, Darwinism associated with Wilson, [[Robert Trivers]], and [[W. D. Hamilton]]. The related development of [[behavioural ecology]] has also helped transform ethology. Furthermore, a substantial rapprochement with comparative psychology has occurred, so the modern scientific study of behaviour offers a more or less seamless spectrum of approaches: from [[animal cognition]] to more traditional [[comparative psychology]], ethology, [[sociobiology]], and behavioural ecology.\n\n== Relationship with comparative psychology ==\n[[Comparative psychology]] also studies animal behaviour, but, as opposed to ethology, is construed as a sub-topic of [[psychology]] rather than as one of [[biology]]. Historically, where comparative psychology has included research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about human psychology, ethology involves research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about animal [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[phylogenetic]] history. Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated on the study of learning and tended to research behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending to describe it as instinctive.\n\nThe two approaches are complementary rather than competitive, but they do result in different perspectives, and occasionally conflicts of opinion about matters of substance. In addition, for most of the twentieth century, comparative psychology developed most strongly in [[North America]], while ethology was stronger in [[Europe]]. From a practical standpoint, early comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few [[species]]. Ethologists were more interested in understanding behaviour across a wide range of species to facilitate principled comparisons across [[alpha taxonomy |taxonomic]] groups. Ethologists have made much more use of such cross-species comparisons than comparative psychologists have.\n\n== Instinct ==\n[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg |right |thumb |[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate regurgitating reflex]]\nThe [[Webster's Dictionary |Merriam-Webster dictionary]] defines [[instinct]] as \"A largely inheritable and unalterable tendency of an organism to make a complex and specific response to environmental stimuli without involving reason\".<ref name=\"Merriam\">{{cite web |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |title=Instinct |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instinct}}</ref>\n\n=== Fixed action patterns ===\n{{main |Fixed action pattern}}\n\nAn important development, associated with the name of Konrad Lorenz though probably due more to his teacher, [[Oskar Heinroth]], was the identification of [[fixed action pattern]]s (FAPs).

It is the process whereby an animal ceases responding to a stimulus. Often, the response is an innate behaviour. Essentially, the animal learns not to respond to irrelevant stimuli. For example, [[prairie dog]]s (''Cynomys ludovicianus'') give alarm calls when predators approach, causing all individuals in the group to quickly scramble down burrows. When prairie dog towns are located near trails used by humans, giving alarm calls every time a person walks by is expensive in terms of time and energy. Habituation to humans is therefore an important adaptation in this context.<ref name=\"Breed\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/habituation.html |title=Habituation |author=Breed, M.

This important type of learning only takes place in a very limited period of time. Lorenz observed that the young of birds such as [[goose |geese]] and [[chicken]]s followed their mothers spontaneously from almost the first day after they were hatched, and he discovered that this response could be imitated by an arbitrary stimulus if the eggs were incubated artificially and the stimulus were presented during a critical period that continued for a few days after hatching.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mercer |first=Jean |title=Understanding attachment: parenting, child care, and emotional development |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-98217-1 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural learning===\n{{main |Cultural transmission in animals}}\n\n====Observational learning====\n{{main |Observational learning}}\n\n====Imitation====\n{{main |Imitation}}\n\n[[Imitation]] is an advanced behaviour whereby an animal observes and exactly replicates the behaviour of another.\nThe National Institutes of Health reported that capuchin monkeys preferred the company of researchers who imitated them to that of researchers who did not.

Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four separate occasions.

Many insects, for example, have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching to obtain food. [[Ant]]s, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called \"[[tandem running]],\" in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food.<ref name=hoppit>{{cite journal | last1=Hoppitt | first1=W.

The [[stickleback]]'s complex mating ritual, studied by Tinbergen, is regarded as a notable example of a FAP.\n\nOften in [[social relation|social life]], animals fight for the right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of fighting for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called [[pecking order]] among [[poultry]]. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain time length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.\n\n==Living in groups==\n\nSeveral animal species, including humans, tend to live in groups. [[Group size measures |Group size]] is a major aspect of their social environment. [[Social relation |Social life]] is probably a complex and effective survival strategy. It may be regarded as a sort of [[symbiosis]] among individuals of the same species: a [[society]] is composed of a group of individuals belonging to the same species living within well-defined rules on [[food]] management, role assignments and reciprocal dependence.\n\nWhen [[biologist]]s interested in [[evolution theory]] first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, such as how the birth of [[Reproduce |sterile]] [[caste]]s, like in [[bee]]s, could be explained through an evolving mechanism that emphasizes the reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like [[squirrel]]s, an individual would risk its own life to save the rest of the group. These behaviours may be examples of [[Altruism (biology) |altruism]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Cummings, Mark |author2=Zahn-Waxler, Carolyn  |author3=Iannotti, Ronald |title=Altruism and aggression: biological and social origins |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42367-0 |page=7}}</ref> Of course, not all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below.

Why does the animal respond that way instead of some other way?\n* Causation&nbsp;\u2013 What are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent learning?\n* Development&nbsp;\u2013 How does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the animal to display the behaviour?\n* Evolutionary history&nbsp;\u2013 How does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species, and how might it have begun through the process of [[phylogeny]]?\n\nThese explanations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive\u2014all instances of behaviour require an explanation at each of these four levels. For example, the function of eating is to acquire nutrients (which ultimately aids survival and reproduction), but the immediate cause of eating is hunger (causation). Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species (evolutionary history), and develop early within an organism's lifespan (development). It is easy to confuse such questions\u2014for example, to argue that people eat because they're hungry and not to acquire nutrients\u2014without realizing that the reason people experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients.<ref>Barrett et al.

The position of an electromagnetic wave within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] can be characterized by either its [[frequency]] of oscillation or its [[wavelength]].  Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter.

EM waves carry [[energy]], [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum]] away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to [[matter]] with which they interact.  Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (\"radiate\") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the [[Near and far field|far field]]. In this language, the [[Near and far field|near field]] refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them specifically, [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[electrostatic induction]] phenomena.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of [[photon]]s, uncharged [[elementary particle]]s with zero [[rest mass]] which are the [[quantum|quanta]] of the [[electromagnetic force]], responsible for all electromagnetic interactions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/physics/ekspong/|title=The Dual Nature of Light as Reflected in the Nobel Archives|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-09-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715170621/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/physics/ekspong/|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  [[Quantum electrodynamics]] is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/astronomy-and-space-exploration/astronomy-general/electromagnetic-spectrum|title=Electromagnetic Spectrum facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Electromagnetic Spectrum|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613005456/http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/astronomy-and-space-exploration/astronomy-general/electromagnetic-spectrum|archivedate=13 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the [[Atomic electron transition|transition of electrons]] to lower [[energy level]]s in an atom and [[black-body radiation]].<ref name=\"Tipler\">{{cite book| last1  = Tipler| first1 = Paul A. | title  = Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics| publisher = MacMillan| date   = 1999| pages  = 454| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=U9lkAkTdAosC&pg=PA454&dq=%22electromagnetic+waves%22+charges+accelerate| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 1572594918}}</ref> The energy of an individual photon is [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by [[Planck\u2013Einstein relation|Planck's equation]] {{nowrap begin}}''E'' = ''h\u03bd''{{nowrap end}}, where ''E'' is the energy per photon, ''\u03bd'' is the frequency of the photon, and ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.\n\nThe effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's [[Power (physics)|power]] and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called ''[[non-ionizing radiation]]'', because its photons do not individually have enough energy to [[ionization|ionize]] atoms or molecules or break [[chemical bond]]s. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ''[[ionizing radiation]]'', since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to [[ionization|ionize]] molecules or break [[chemical bond]]s. These radiations have the ability to cause [[chemical reaction]]s and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard.\n\n{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrodynamics}}\n\n==Physics==\n===Theory===\n[[File:VisibleEmrWavelengths.svg|thumb|Shows the relative wavelengths of the electromagnetic waves of three different colours of [[Visible light|light]] (blue, green, and red) with a distance scale in micrometers along the x-axis.]]\n{{main|Maxwell's equations|Near and far field}}\n\n==== Maxwell\u2019s equations ====\n[[James Clerk Maxwell]] derived a [[Electromagnetic wave equation|wave form of the electric and magnetic equations]], thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]].

In an electromagnetic wave, the changes in the electric field are always accompanied by a wave in the magnetic field in one direction, and vice versa. This relationship between the two occurs without either type field causing the other; rather, they occur together in the same way that time and space changes occur together and are interlinked in [[special relativity]]. In fact, magnetic fields can be viewed as electric field in other frame of reference(s)' and electric fields which can be viewed also as magnetic fields in other frame of reference(s),  but they have equal significance as physics is same in all frame of reference(s). so the close relationship between space and time changes here is more than an analogy. Together, these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave, which moves out into space and need never again affect the source. The distant EM field formed in this way by the acceleration of a charge carries energy with it that \"radiates\" away through space, hence the term.\n\n==== Near and far fields ====\n{{main|Near and far field|Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential}}\n[[File:FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|In electromagnetic radiation (such as microwaves from an antenna, shown here) the term applies only to the parts of the [[electromagnetic field]] that radiate into infinite space and decrease in intensity by an [[inverse-square law]] of power, so that the total radiation energy that crosses through an imaginary spherical surface is the same, no matter how far away from the antenna the spherical surface is drawn. Electromagnetic radiation thus includes the [[near and far field|far field]] part of the electromagnetic field around a transmitter. A part of the \"near-field\" close to the transmitter, forms part of the changing [[electromagnetic field]], but does not count as electromagnetic radiation.]]\nMaxwell's equations established that some charges and currents (\"sources\") produce a local type of [[electromagnetic field]] near them that does ''not'' have the behaviour of EMR. Currents directly produce a magnetic field, but it is of a [[magnetic dipole]] type that dies out with distance from the current. In a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an [[electric dipole]] type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields make up the [[near and far field|near-field]] near the EMR source. Neither of these behaviours are responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they cause electromagnetic field behaviour that only efficiently transfers power to a receiver very close to the source, such as the [[electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] inside a [[transformer]], or the feedback behaviour that happens close to the coil of a [[metal detector]]. Typically, near-fields have a powerful effect on their own sources, causing an increased \u201cload\u201d (decreased [[electrical reactance]]) in the source or transmitter, whenever energy is withdrawn from the EM field by a receiver. Otherwise, these fields do not \u201cpropagate\u201d freely out into space, carrying their energy away without distance-limit, but rather oscillate, returning their energy to the transmitter if it is not received by a receiver.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nBy contrast, the EM far-field is composed of ''radiation'' that is free of the transmitter in the sense that (unlike the case in an electrical transformer) the transmitter requires the same power to send these changes in the fields out, whether the signal is immediately picked up or not. This distant part of the electromagnetic field ''is'' \"electromagnetic radiation\" (also called the [[Near and far field|far-field]]). The far-fields propagate (radiate) without allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver. Due to [[conservation of energy]], the amount of power passing through any spherical surface drawn around the source is the same. Because such a surface has an area proportional to the square of its distance from the source, the [[power density]] of EM radiation always decreases with the inverse square of distance from the source; this is called the [[inverse-square law]]. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM field close to the source (the near-field), which varies in power according to an inverse cube power law, and thus does ''not'' transport a conserved amount of energy over distances, but instead fades with distance, with its energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe far-field (EMR) depends on a different mechanism for its production than the near-field, and upon different terms in Maxwell\u2019s equations. Whereas the magnetic part of the near-field is due to currents in the source, the magnetic field in EMR is due only to the local change in the electric field. In a similar way, while the electric field in the near-field is due directly to the charges and charge-separation in the source, the electric field in EMR is due to a change in the local magnetic field. Both processes for producing electric and magnetic EMR fields have a different dependence on distance than do near-field dipole electric and magnetic fields. That is why the EMR type of EM field becomes dominant in power \u201cfar\u201d from sources. The term \u201cfar from sources\u201d refers to how far from the source (moving at the speed of light) any portion of the outward-moving EM field is located, by the time that source currents are changed by the varying source potential, and the source has therefore begun to generate an outwardly moving EM field of a different phase.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nA more compact view of EMR is that the far-field that composes EMR is generally that part of the EM field that has traveled sufficient distance from the source, that it has become completely disconnected from any feedback to the charges and currents that were originally responsible for it. Now independent of the source charges, the EM field, as it moves farther away, is dependent only upon the accelerations of the charges that produced it. It no longer has a strong connection to the direct fields of the charges, or to the velocity of the charges (currents).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn the [[Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential]] formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell's equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle's uniform velocity, are both associated with the electromagnetic near-field, and do not comprise EM radiation.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Properties===\n[[File:Electromagneticwave3D.gif|thumb|Electromagnetic waves can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields.

Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of [[superposition principle|superposition]]. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to [[vector addition]].<ref>Purcell, p442: \"Any number of electromagnetic waves can propagate through the same region without affecting one another. The field '''E''' at a space time point is the vector sum of the electric fields of the individual waves, and the same goes for '''B'''\".</ref> For example, in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by constructive or destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual lightwaves.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nSince light is an oscillation it is not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum.

Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. It is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not evidence of \"particulate\" behavior.

In dissipation less (lossless) media, these '''E''' and '''B''' fields are also in phase, with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see illustrations). A common misconception is that the '''E''' and '''B''' fields in electromagnetic radiation are out of phase because a change in one produces the other, and this would produce a phase difference between them as sinusoidal functions (as indeed happens in [[electromagnetic induction]], and in the [[near and far field|near-field]] close to antennas). However, in the far-field EM radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell [[curl (mathematics)|curl operator]] equations, a more correct description is that a time-change in one type of field is proportional to a space-change in the other. These derivatives require that the '''E''' and '''B''' fields in EMR are in-phase (see math section below).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAn important aspect of light's nature is its frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in [[hertz]], the [[SI]] unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per [[second]]. Light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon known as [[Dispersion relation|dispersion]].\n\nA wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the [[wavelength]]. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle v=f\\lambda</math>\n\nwhere ''v'' is the speed of the wave (''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum, or less in other media), ''f'' is the frequency and \u03bb is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.\n\nElectromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell's [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. Two main classes of solutions are known, namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite) distance from the source.  Both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation).  As with any time function, this can be decomposed by means of [[Fourier analysis]] into its [[frequency spectrum]], or individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single frequency, amplitude and phase. Such a component wave is said to be ''monochromatic''.  A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some reference phase, its direction of propagation and its polarization.\n\nInterference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference. An example of interference caused by EMR is [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) or as it is more commonly known as, [[Radio frequency interference|radio-frequency interference]] (RFI).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Additionally, multiple polarization signals can be combined (i.e. interfered) to form new states of polarization, which is known as [[parallel polarization state generation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=She|first1=Alan|last2=Capasso|first2=Federico|title=Parallel Polarization State Generation|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=26019|doi=10.1038/srep26019|pmid=27184813|pmc=4869035|date=17 May 2016|arxiv=1602.04463|bibcode=2016NatSR...626019S}}</ref>\n\nThe energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called [[radiant energy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html|title=What Is Electromagnetic Radiation?|work=Live Science|access-date=2017-09-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152301/https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sjQHyn5ZVcIC|page=635}}|title=The Earth Around Us: Maintaining A Livable Planet|last=Schneiderman|first=Jill|date=2000-03-27|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=9781466814431|language=en|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AUriAAAAMAAJ|page=22}}|title=The Michigan Technic|date=1960|publisher=UM Libraries|language=en|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Particle model and quantum theory===\n{{see also|Quantization (physics)|Quantum optics}}\n\nAn anomaly arose in the late 19th century involving a contradiction between the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as [[black body|black bodies]]. Physicists struggled with this problem, which later became known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], unsuccessfully for many years. In 1900, [[Max Planck]] developed a new theory of [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|black-body radiation]] that explained the observed spectrum. Planck's theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit light (and other electromagnetic radiation) only as discrete bundles or packets of [[energy]]. These packets were called [[quantum|quanta]]. Later, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles. Later the particle of light was given the name [[photon]], to correspond with other particles being described around this time, such as the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. A photon has an energy, ''E'', proportional to its frequency, ''f'', by\n\n: <math>E = hf = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\,\\! </math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], <math>\\lambda</math> is the wavelength and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].

Experimental measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons was proportional to the ''[[frequency]]'', rather than the ''[[intensity (physics)|intensity]]'', of the light. Furthermore, below a certain minimum frequency, which depended on the particular metal, no current would flow regardless of the intensity. These observations appeared to contradict the wave theory, and for years physicists tried in vain to find an explanation. In 1905, Einstein explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to explain the observed effect. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, however, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism among established physicists. Eventually Einstein's explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was observed, such as the [[Compton effect]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs a photon is absorbed by an [[atom]], it [[Excited state|excites]] the atom, elevating an [[electron]] to a higher [[energy level]] (one that is on average farther from the nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called [[fluorescence]], a type of [[photoluminescence]]. An example is visible light emitted from fluorescent paints, in response to ultraviolet ([[blacklight]]). Many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than visible light. Delayed emission is called [[phosphorescence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.majordifferences.com/2016/11/7-differences-between-fluorescence-and-Phosphorescence.html|title=7 Differences between Fluorescence and Phosphorescence|last=Haneef|first=Deena T.

More generally, the theory states that everything has both a particle nature and a wave nature, and various experiments can be done to bring out one or the other. The particle nature is more easily discerned using an object with a large mass. A bold proposition by [[Louis de Broglie]] in 1924 led the scientific community to realize that [[electron]]s also exhibited wave\u2013particle duality.<ref>{{cite book | author=Browne, Michael|title= ''Physics for Engineering and Science'' | publisher= McGraw-Hill/Schaum |edition= 2nd | date=2010| isbn= 978-0-07-161399-6}} Chapter 36, page 382: de Broglie Waves. \"Light exhibits both wave properties (interference, diffraction, refraction) and particle properties (photoelectric effect, scattering.)\"</ref>\n\n===Wave and particle effects of electromagnetic radiation===\nTogether, wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and absorption spectra of EM radiation. The matter-composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and emission spectrum. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. Dark bands in the [[absorption spectroscopy|absorption spectrum]] are due to the atoms in an intervening medium between source and observer. The atoms absorb certain frequencies of the light between emitter and detector/eye, then emit them in all directions. A dark band appears to the detector, due to the radiation scattered out of the beam. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant [[star]] are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. A similar phenomenon occurs for [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]], which is seen when an emitting gas glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism, including heat. As electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons, but lines are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after excitation.<ref>Browne, p 376: \"Radiation is emitted or absorbed only when the electron jumps from one orbit to the other, and the frequency of radiation depends only upon on the energies of the electron in the initial and final orbits.</ref> An example is the [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] spectrum of [[nebula]]e.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature.\n\nThese phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition of gases lit from behind (absorption spectra) and for glowing gases (emission spectra). Spectroscopy (for example) determines what [[chemical element]]s comprise a particular star. Spectroscopy is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the [[red shift]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Spectroscopy|url=http://www.redshift.org.uk/spectroscopy|website=National Redshift Project|publisher=National Redshift Project|accessdate=19 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234024/http://www.redshift.org.uk/spectroscopy|archivedate=1 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Propagation speed===\n{{main|Speed of light}}\n\nWhen any wire (or other conducting object such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]) conducts [[alternating current]], electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current. In many such situations it is possible to identify an electrical dipole moment that arises from separation of charges due to the exciting electrical potential, and this dipole moment oscillates in time, as the charges move back and forth. This oscillation at a given frequency gives rise to changing electric and magnetic fields, which then set the electromagnetic radiation in motion.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAt the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates. Charged particles in a [[stationary state]] do not move, but a superposition of such states may result in a transition state that has an [[electric dipole moment]] that oscillates in time. This oscillating dipole moment is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle. Such states occur (for example) in atoms when photons are radiated as the atom shifts from one stationary state to another.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs a wave, light is characterized by a velocity (the [[speed of light]]), [[wavelength]], and [[frequency]]. As particles, light is a stream of [[photon|photons.]] Each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by [[Max Planck|Planck's]] relation ''E = hf'', where ''E'' is the energy of the photon, ''h'' = 6.626 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221234</sup> J\u00b7s is [[Planck's constant]], and ''f'' is the frequency of the wave.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nOne rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum travels at the [[speed of light]], ''relative to the observer'', regardless of the observer's velocity. (This observation led to Einstein's development of the theory of [[special relativity]].){{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn a medium (other than vacuum), [[velocity of propagation|velocity factor]] or [[refractive index]] are considered, depending on frequency and application. Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Special theory of relativity===\n{{Main|Special theory of relativity}}\n\nBy the [[late nineteenth century]], various experimental anomalies could not be explained by the simple wave theory. One of these anomalies involved a controversy over the speed of light. The speed of light and other EMR predicted by Maxwell's equations did not appear unless the equations were modified in a way first suggested by [[George Francis FitzGerald|FitzGerald]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] (see [[history of special relativity]]), or else otherwise that speed would depend on the speed of observer relative to the \"medium\" (called [[luminiferous aether]]) which supposedly \"carried\" the electromagnetic wave (in a manner analogous to the way air carries sound waves). Experiments failed to find any observer effect. In 1905, Einstein proposed that space and time appeared to be velocity-changeable entities for light propagation and all other processes and laws. These changes accounted for the constancy of the speed of light and all electromagnetic radiation, from the viewpoints of all observers\u2014even those in relative motion.\n\n==History of discovery==\n{{see also|History of electromagnetic theory|Timeline of electromagnetic theory}}\n\nElectromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of [[infrared]] radiation is ascribed to astronomer [[William Herschel]], who published his results in 1800 before the [[Royal Society of London]].<ref name=HerschelRSIR>{{cite journal|jstor=107057|title=Experiments on the Refrangibility of the Invisible Rays of the Sun.

These \"calorific rays\" were later termed infrared.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn 1801, German physicist [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] discovered [[ultraviolet]] in an experiment similar to Hershel's, using sunlight and a glass prism. Ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened [[silver chloride]] preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays (which at first were called \"chemical rays\") were capable of causing chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[File:James Clerk Maxwell sitting.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]\nIn 1862-4 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed equations for the electromagnetic field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed that was very close to the known speed of light. Maxwell therefore suggested that visible light (as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet rays by inference) all consisted of propagating disturbances (or radiation) in the electromagnetic field. Radio waves were first produced deliberately by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light, following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested by Maxwell's equations. Hertz also developed ways to detect these waves, and produced and characterized what were later termed [[radio wave]]s and [[microwave]]s.<ref name=Jeans>[[James Jeans|Jeans, James]] (1947) [https://archive.org/stream/growthofphysical029068mbp#page/n11/mode/2up The Growth of Physical Science].

After experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. In one month, he discovered X-rays' main properties.<ref name=Jeans/>{{rp|307}}\n\nThe last portion of the EM spectrum to be discovered was associated with [[radioactivity]]. [[Henri Becquerel]] found that [[uranium]] salts caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner similar to X-rays, and [[Marie Curie]] discovered that only certain elements gave off these rays of energy, soon discovering the intense radiation of [[radium]]. The radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays ([[alpha particle]]s) and beta rays ([[beta particle]]s) by [[Ernest Rutherford]] through simple experimentation in 1899, but these proved to be charged particulate types of radiation. However, in 1900 the French scientist [[Paul Villard]] discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named [[gamma ray]]s. In 1910 British physicist [[William Henry Bragg]] demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914 Rutherford and [[Edward Andrade]] measured their wavelengths, finding that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequency, although a 'cross-over' between X and gamma rays makes it possible to have X-rays with a higher energy (and hence shorter wavelength) than gamma rays and vice versa. The origin of the ray differentiates them, gamma rays tend to be a natural phenomena originating from the unstable nucleus of an atom and X-rays are electrically generated (and hence man-made) unless they are as a result of [[bremsstrahlung]] X-radiation caused by the interaction of fast moving particles (such as beta particles) colliding with certain materials, usually of higher atomic numbers.<ref name=Jeans/>{{rp|308,9}}\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum==\n[[File:EM spectrumrevised.png|thumb|upright=2.25|right|[[Electromagnetic spectrum]] with visible light highlighted]]\n{{main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n[[File:Light spectrum.svg|right|frame|'''Legend:'''<br />\n\u03b3 = [[Gamma ray]]s<br />\n<br />\nHX = Hard [[X-ray]]s<br />\nSX = Soft X-Rays<br />\n<br />\nEUV = Extreme-[[ultraviolet]]<br />\nNUV = Near-ultraviolet<br />\n<br />\n[[Visible light]] (colored bands)<br />\n<br />\nNIR = Near-[[infrared]]<br />\nMIR = Mid-infrared<br />\nFIR = Far-infrared<br />\n<br />\nEHF = [[Extremely high frequency]] (microwaves)<br />\nSHF = [[Super-high frequency]] (microwaves)<br />\n<br />\nUHF = [[Ultrahigh frequency]] (radio waves)<br />\nVHF = [[Very high frequency]] (radio)<br />\nHF = [[High frequency]] (radio)<br />\nMF = [[Medium frequency]] (radio)<br />\nLF = [[Low frequency]] (radio)<br />\nVLF = [[Very low frequency]] (radio)<br />\nVF = [[Voice frequency]]<br />\nULF = [[Ultra-low frequency]] (radio)<br />\nSLF = [[Super-low frequency]] (radio)<br />\nELF = [[Extremely low frequency]](radio)]]\n\nEM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and [[near and far field|near fields]]) is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave|radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible spectrum|visible]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]]. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can be expressed by [[Fourier analysis]] in terms of [[sinusoidal]] [[monochromatic]] waves, which in turn can each be classified into these regions of the EMR spectrum.\n\nFor certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as ''random'', and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or [[stochastic process]]es. In such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their ''power'' content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a representation is called the [[power spectral density]] of the random process. Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the [[Zero point field|Zero point wave field]] of the electromagnetic vacuum.\n\nThe behavior of EM radiation depends on its frequency. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and are associated with photons of higher energy. There is no fundamental limit known to these wavelengths or energies, at either end of the spectrum, although photons with energies near the [[Planck energy]] or exceeding it (far too high to have ever been observed) will require new physical theories to describe.\n\nSoundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation'''.''' At the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 20&nbsp;Hz to about 20&nbsp;kHz, are frequencies that might be considered in the audio range. However, electromagnetic waves cannot be directly perceived by human [[ears]]. Sound waves are instead the oscillating compression of molecules. To be heard, electromagnetic radiation must be converted to pressure waves of the fluid in which the [[ear]] is located (whether the fluid is air, water or something else).\n\n=== Interactions as a function of frequency ===\nWhen EM radiation interacts with matter, its behavior changes qualitatively as its frequency changes.\n\n==== Radio and microwave ====\nAt radio and microwave frequencies, EMR interacts with matter largely as a bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of affected atoms. In [[electrical conductor]]s, such induced bulk movement of charges ([[electric current]]s) results in absorption of the EMR, or else separations of charges that cause generation of new EMR (effective reflection of the EMR). An example is absorption or emission of radio waves by antennas, or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with an electric dipole moment, as for example inside a [[microwave oven]]. These interactions produce either electric currents or heat, or both.\n\n==== Infrared ====\nLike radio and microwave, infrared also is reflected by metals (as is most EMR into the ultraviolet). However, unlike lower-frequency radio and microwave radiation, Infrared EMR commonly interacts with dipoles present in single molecules, which change as atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond. It is consequently absorbed by a wide range of substances, causing them to increase in temperature as the vibrations dissipate as [[heat]]. The same process, run in reverse, causes bulk substances to radiate in the infrared spontaneously (see [[thermal radiation]] section below).\n\n==== Visible light ====\nAs frequency increases into the visible range, photons have enough energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules. It is not a coincidence that this happens in the \"visible range,\" as the [[Visual system|mechanism of vision]] involves the change in bonding of a single molecule ([[retinal]]) which absorbs light in the [[rhodopsin]] in the [[retina]] of the human eye. [[Photosynthesis]] becomes possible in this range as well, for similar reasons, as a single molecule of [[chlorophyll]] is excited by a single photon. Animals that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change temperature, in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons (see [[infrared sensing in snakes]]). For this reason, infrared, microwaves and radio waves are thought to damage molecules and biological tissue only by bulk heating, not excitation from single photons of the radiation.\n\nVisible light is able to affect a few molecules with single photons, but usually not in a permanent or damaging way, in the absence of power high enough to increase temperature to damaging levels. However, in plant tissues that conduct photosynthesis, [[carotenoids]] act to quench electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process called [[non-photochemical quenching]], in order to prevent reactions that would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels. Limited evidence indicate that some [[reactive oxygen species]] are created by visible light in skin, and that these may have some role in photoaging, in the same manner as [[ultraviolet A]].<ref name=\"r1\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Liebel | first1 = F. | last2 = Kaur | first2 = S. | last3 = Ruvolo | first3 = E. | last4 = Kollias | first4 = N. | last5 = Southall | first5 = M.

In [[DNA]], this causes lasting damage. DNA is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by ultraviolet A (UVA), which has energy too low to damage DNA directly. This is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage DNA, and is capable of causing cancer, and (for [[UVB]]) skin burns (sunburn) that are far worse than would be produced by simple heating (temperature increase) effects. This property of causing molecular damage that is out of proportion to heating effects, is characteristic of all EMR with frequencies at the visible light range and above. These properties of high-frequency EMR are due to quantum effects that permanently damage materials and tissues at the molecular level.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAt the higher end of the ultraviolet range, the energy of photons becomes large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be liberated from the atom, in a process called [[photoionisation]]. The energy required for this is always larger than about 10 [[electron volt]]s (eV) corresponding with wavelengths smaller than 124&nbsp;nm (some sources suggest a more realistic cutoff of 33 eV, which is the energy required to ionize water). This high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the approximate ionization range, is sometimes called \"extreme UV.\" Ionizing UV is strongly filtered by the Earth's atmosphere).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==== X-rays and gamma rays ====\nElectromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization energy, or more, (which includes the entire spectrum with shorter wavelengths), is therefore termed [[ionizing radiation]]. (Many other kinds of ionizing radiation are made of non-EM particles). Electromagnetic-type ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths, which means that all [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]] qualify. These are capable of the most severe types of molecular damage, which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule, including mutation and cancer, and often at great depths below the skin, since the higher end of the X-ray spectrum, and all of the gamma ray spectrum, penetrate matter.\n\n==Atmosphere and magnetosphere==\n{{main|ozone layer|shortwave radio|skywave|ionosphere}}\n[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric absorption and scattering (or [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of various [[wavelength]]s of electromagnetic radiation]]\nMost UV and X-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular [[nitrogen]], and then (for wavelengths in the upper UV) from the electronic excitation of [[dioxygen]] and finally [[ozone]] at the mid-range of UV. Only 30% of the Sun's ultraviolet light reaches the ground, and almost all of this is well transmitted.\n\nVisible light is well transmitted in air, as it is not energetic enough to excite nitrogen, oxygen, or ozone, but too energetic to excite molecular vibrational frequencies of water vapor.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAbsorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation in water vapor. However, at energies too low to excite water vapor, the atmosphere becomes transparent again, allowing free transmission of most microwave and radio waves.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nFinally, at radio wavelengths longer than 10 meters or so (about 30&nbsp;MHz), the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio, but plasma in certain layers of the [[ionosphere]] begins to interact with radio waves (see [[skywave]]). This property allows some longer wavelengths (100 meters or 3&nbsp;MHz) to be reflected and results in [[shortwave radio]] beyond line-of-sight.

When electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the context. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to [[thermal equilibrium]] and manifesting itself as [[thermal energy]], or even [[Temperature#Kinetic theory approach to temperature|kinetic energy]], in the material. With a few exceptions related to high-energy photons (such as [[fluorescence]], [[harmonic generation]], [[photochemical reaction]]s, the [[photovoltaic effect]] for ionizing radiations at far ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation), absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by [[heat]]ing the material. This happens for infrared, microwave and radio wave radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food.

They have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, <math>E_0 = c_0 B_0</math>, which can be seen immediately from the [[Poynting vector]]. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as <math>\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>. Also, '''E''' and '''B''' far-fields in free space, which as wave solutions depend primarily on these two Maxwell equations, are in-phase with each other. This is guaranteed since the generic wave solution is first order in both space and time, and the [[curl (mathematics)|curl operator]] on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations, which gives the other field, is first-order in time, resulting in the same [[phase shift]] for both fields in each mathematical operation.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. On a quantum level, it is described as [[photon polarization]].

His economical and understated style\u2014which he termed the [[iceberg theory]]\u2014had a strong influence on [[20th century in literature|20th-century fiction]], while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three of his novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of [[American literature]].\n\nHemingway was raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. After high school, he reported for a few months for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', before leaving for the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] to enlist as an [[List of ambulance drivers during World War I|ambulance driver in World War I]]. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1929).\n\nIn 1921, he married [[Hadley Richardson]], the first of what would be four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a [[Correspondent|foreign correspondent]] and fell under the influence of the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His [[debut novel]], ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', was published in 1926. After his 1927 divorce from Richardson, Hemingway married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]; they divorced after he returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]], where he had been a journalist. He based ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940) on his experience there. [[Martha Gellhorn]] became his third wife in 1940; they separated after he met [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Welsh]] in London during [[World War II]]. He was present at the [[Normandy landings]] and the [[liberation of Paris]].\n\nShortly after the publication of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' (1952), Hemingway went on [[safari]] to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill-health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in [[Key West, Florida]] (in the 1930s) and Cuba (in the 1940s and 1950s). In 1959, he bought a house in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], where, in mid-1961 he shot himself in the head.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n<!-- [[File:Ernest Hemingway Birthplace (7416212780).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ernest Hemingway Birthplace in the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District in Oak Park, now a museum]]\n -->\n[[File:ErnestHemingwayBabyPicture.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hemingway was the second child and first son born to Clarence and Grace Hemingway.|alt= photograph of an infant]]\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140</ref> His father, Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, was a physician, and his mother, [[Grace Hall Hemingway]], was a musician.

Reynolds points out that Hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm.<ref name=\"Reynolds 2000 19\">Reynolds (2000), 19</ref> Her insistence that he learn to play the cello became a \"source of conflict\", but he later admitted the music lessons were useful to his writing, as is evident in the \"[[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] structure\" of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.<ref>Meyers (1985), 3</ref> The family spent summers at [[Ernest Hemingway Cottage|Windemere]] on [[Walloon Lake]], near [[Petoskey, Michigan]]. Hemingway's father taught him to hunt, fish, and camp in the woods and lakes of [[Northern Michigan]] as a young boy.

He took part in a number of sports such as boxing, track and field, water polo, and football. He excelled in English classes,<ref>Mellow (1992), 21</ref> and with his sister Marcelline, performed in the school orchestra for two years.<ref name=\"Reynolds 2000 19\" /> During his junior year he had a journalism class, structured \"as though the classroom were a newspaper office,\" with better writers submitting pieces to the school newspaper, ''The Trapeze''.

By the time of his release and return to the United States in January 1919, Agnes and Hemingway had decided to marry within a few months in America. However, in March, she wrote that she had become engaged to an Italian officer. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers states in his book ''Hemingway: A Biography'' that Hemingway was devastated by Agnes's rejection, and in future relationships, he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him.<ref name=\"Meyers p37ff\">Meyers (1985), 37\u201342</ref>\n\n=== Toronto and Chicago ===\nHemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment.

Within months a second volume, ''in our time'' (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the thrill of the ''[[Bullfighting|corrida]]''.

Two days later, in the early morning hours of July 2, 1961, Hemingway \"quite deliberately\" shot himself with his favorite shotgun.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 16</ref> He had unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept, gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer of their Ketchum home, and according to Mellow, shot himself with the \"double-barreled shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend\".<ref>Mellow (1992), 604</ref>\n\nMary called the Sun Valley Hospital, and a doctor quickly arrived at the house who determined Hemingway \"had died of a self-inflicted wound to the head\". Mary was sedated and taken to the hospital, returning home the next day where she cleaned the house, and saw to the funeral arrangements and travel arrangements.

After World War&nbsp;I, he and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences\u2014a fiction in which nothing crucial\u2014or at least very little\u2014is stated explicitly.\"<ref name=\"Putnam\" />\n\nBecause he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to \"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"<ref name=\"Baker p117\">Baker (1972),  117</ref> Hemingway called his style the [[iceberg theory]]: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight.<ref name=\"Baker p117\" /> The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \"theory of omission\". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in \"The Big Two-Hearted River\") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<ref>Oliver (1999), 321\u2013322</ref>  Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'', showed he was still experimenting with his writing style.<ref>Smith (1996), 45</ref> He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are [[simple sentence]]s\u2014a childlike syntax without [[subordinate clause|subordination]].<ref>Wells (1975), 130\u2013133</ref>\n\nJackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general\u2014not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\"<ref>Benson (1989), 351</ref>  Writing in \"The Art of the Short Story\", Hemingway explains: \"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"<ref>Hemingway (1975), 3</ref>\n\nThe simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&nbsp;I had \"used up words\". Hemingway offers a \"multi-focal\" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences. The photographic \"[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]\" style creates a [[collage]] of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an \"embedded text\" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of \"cutting\" quickly from one scene to the next; or of \"splicing\" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.<ref>Trodd (2007), 8</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em\n|quote = In the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.

This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy.

Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp \"the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always\".<ref>Hemingway, Ernest.

Critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as \"The Sacred Land\"\u2014the [[American Old West|American West]]\u2014extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" />  According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus\" /> Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" /> Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.<ref name=\"Baker1972 101\u2013121\">Baker (1972), 101\u2013121</ref> At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], evident in detailed descriptions such as those in \"Big Two-Hearted River\".<ref name=\"Beegel2000, p. 63-70\" />\n\nFiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil \"Dark Woman\" versus the good \"Light Woman\". The dark woman\u2014Brett Ashley of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''\u2014is a goddess; the light woman\u2014Margot Macomber of \"[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]\"\u2014is a murderess.<ref name=\"Fiedler\">Fiedler (1975), 345\u2013365</ref> [[Robert Scholes]] admits that early Hemingway stories, such as \"[[A Very Short Story]]\", present \"a male character favorably and a female unfavorably\".<ref>Scholes (1990),  42</ref>  According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into \"castrators or love-slaves\". Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as \"public enemy number one\", although more recent re-evaluations of his work \"have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.\"<ref>Sanderson (1996), 171</ref> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber \"are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.{{'\"}}<ref>Baym (1990), 112</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em\n|quote =The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places.

The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in \"Indian Camp\" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \"badly scarred and nervous young man\". Hemingway sets the events in \"Indian Camp\" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes \"Indian Camp\" holds the \"master key\" to \"what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career\".<ref>Young (1964), 6</ref> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if \"nothingness\" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus\">Stoltzfus (2005), 215\u2013218</ref> In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'', Timo M\u00fcller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an \"authentic life\", and the \"soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature\".<ref>M\u00fcller (2010), 31</ref>\n\nThe theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in ''The Sun Also Rises''. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]]. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" /> Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the \"natural\" versus the \"unnatural\". In \"Alpine Idyll\" the \"unnaturalness\" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the \"unnaturalness\" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the \"natural\" spring for redemption.<ref name=\"Baker1972 101\u2013121\" />\n\nSusan Beegel has written that some more recent critics\u2014writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after Hemingway's death, and more than half a century after his novels were first published\u2014have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as [[misogynistic]] and [[homophobic]].<ref name=\"Beegel 1996 282\">Beegel (1996), 282</ref> In her 1996 essay, \"Critical Reception\", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that \"critics interested in multiculturalism\", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some \"apologetics\" have been written.<ref>Beegel (1996)</ref> Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, ''The Sun Also Rises'', in which a critic contended: \"Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.\" Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the \"horror of [[homosexuality]]\" and the \"[[racism]]\" typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction.<ref name=\"Beegel 1996 282\" /> In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: \"Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article294978/Susan-Beegel-What-I-like-about-Hemingway.html|title=Susan Beegel: What I like about Hemingway|website=kansascity.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and legacy ==\n[[File:Statue of Hemingway at Floridita.jpg|thumb|Life-sized statue of Hemingway by [[Jos\u00e9 Villa Sober\u00f3n]], at [[El Floridita]] bar in [[Havana]]]]\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140\u2013141</ref> After his reputation was established with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises'', he became the spokesperson for the post\u2013World War&nbsp;I generation, having established a style to follow.<ref name=\"Nagel 1996 87\" /> His books were [[Nazi book burning|burned]] in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by his parents as \"filth\".<ref name=\"Hallengren\">Hallengren, Anders.

Based on the 1936 novel ''A Shilling for Candles'' by [[Josephine Tey]], the film is about a young man on the run from a murder charge who enlists the help of a woman who must put herself at risk for his cause. It is notable for an elaborately staged [[crane shot]] Hitchcock devised towards the end of the film, which identifies the real murderer.\n\n==Plot==\nOn a stormy night, at a retreat on the English coast, Christine Clay (Pamela Carme), a successful actress, argues passionately with her jealous ex-husband Guy ([[George Curzon (actor)|George Curzon]]). Not accepting her [[Nevada#Divorce|Reno divorce]] as valid, he accuses her of having an affair. Finally, she slaps him and he leaves the room. While they had been arguing, his eyes twitched violently; they continue to do so when, once outside, he turns angrily to look at the closed door behind him.\n\nThe next morning, Robert Tisdall ([[Derrick De Marney]]) happens to be walking along the seaside when Christine's dead body washes ashore. He recognizes her, and runs for help. Two young women arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. The police quickly decide that Tisdall is the only suspect. Christine was strangled with the belt from a raincoat; his raincoat is missing and he says it was recently stolen. He admits knowing the victim from three years ago when he sold her a story, but the authorities assume the two have been having an affair. When they learn that she has left him money in her will (unknown to him), they feel they have hit upon motive and Tisdall is arrested.\n\nScotland Yard detectives grill him all night. The next morning, he faints and is revived with the aid of Erica Burgoyne ([[Nova Pilbeam]]), daughter of the local police Chief Constable. Tisdall is assigned an incompetent [[barrister]], and is taken into court for his formal arraignment. Doubting if his innocence will ever be established, he takes advantage of overcrowding in the courthouse to escape, wearing the barrister's eyeglasses as a disguise. He gets away by riding on the [[running board]] of Erica's [[Morris Motors|Morris car]], revealing himself to her after the car runs out of petrol.\n\nHe helps push the car to a filling station, pays for petrol, and convinces her to give him a ride. Though she is initially fearful and unsure about her passenger, Erica eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and chooses to help him in any way that she can. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run from the police. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat: if it still has its belt, the one found next to Christine's body must not be his.\n\nThe duo succeed in tracing Tisdall's coat to Old Will ([[Edward Rigby]]), a homeless, but sociable, china-mender. But Will was not the thief; he was given the coat by a man with twitchy eyes. And when Will received the coat, its belt was missing.\n\nSeparated from the group, Erica is taken in by the police. Upon realizing that his daughter has fully allied herself with a murder suspect (in fact, she and Tisdall are in love), her father chooses to resign his position as Chief Constable rather than arrest her for assisting a felon. Tisdall sneaks into their house to see her, intending to surrender next, but she mentions that the coat had a box of matches from the Grand Hotel in a pocket. Tisdall has never been there: perhaps the murderer has a connection to the hotel.\n\nErica and Will go to the hotel together, hoping to find him. In a memorably long, continuous sequence, the camera pans right from their entrance to the hotel and then moves forward from the very back of the hotel [[ballroom]], finally focusing in extreme closeup on the drummer in a dance band performing in [[blackface]]. His eyes are twitching. He is Guy.\n\nRecognizing Old Will in the audience, and seeing policemen nearby (actually they have followed Will in the hopes of finding Tisdall), Guy performs poorly due to fear. He is berated by the [[Conducting|conductor]] and, during a break, takes medicine to try to control the twitching, but it makes him very sleepy. Eventually, in mid-performance, Guy passes out, drawing the attention of Erica and the police. Immediately after being revived and confronted, he confesses his crime and begins laughing hysterically.\n\nErica then tells her father that she thinks it is time they invited Tisdall to their home for dinner.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Nova Pilbeam]] as Erica Burgoyne\n* [[Derrick De Marney]] as Robert Tisdall\n* [[Percy Marmont]] as Colonel Burgoyne\n* [[Edward Rigby]] as Old Will\n* [[Mary Clare]] as Erica's aunt Margaret\n* [[John Longden]] as Inspector Kent\n* [[George Curzon (actor)|George Curzon]] as Guy\n* [[Basil Radford]] as Erica's uncle Basil\n* Pamela Carme as Christine Clay\n* [[George Merritt (actor)|George Merritt]] as Detective Sergeant Miller\n* J.

The novel is a [[whodunit]] centred on the Scotland Yard inspector, who is Tey's regular character Alan Grant. The storyline involving Robert Tisdall, Erica Burgoyne, and the missing coat is similar to the film story, but in the novel it is only a subplot and ends part way through the book when Erica finds the coat and it is intact. Grant then focuses on other suspects, none of whom (including the actual murderer in the novel) appear in the film. Christine Clay in the novel is not divorced, but is in an unconventional marriage to an aristocrat.\n\n==Hitchcock's cameo==\n[[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films. He can be seen outside the courthouse, holding a camera, at 14 minutes into the film.\n\n==References in popular culture==\nOn the [[Mike Oldfield]] album ''[[Five Miles Out]]'', on the track \"Orabidoo\", at 9'12\" there can be heard a sample of the conductor criticising the drummer: \"Don't come in again like that.

It is a [[concept album]] detailing the destruction of a man from the beginning of his \"downward spiral\" to his death by [[suicide]]. ''The Downward Spiral'' features elements of industrial rock, [[techno]] and [[heavy metal music]], in contrast to the band's [[synthpop]]-influenced debut album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), and was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Flood (producer)|Flood]].\n\n''The Downward Spiral'' was conceived after the [[Lollapalooza]] 1991 festival tour as a pivot for Reznor's personal issues and the \"negative vibe\" felt by the band. The following year, Reznor moved to [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles]], where actress [[Sharon Tate]] was [[Tate murders|murdered]] by members of the [[Manson Family]]. It was used as a studio called \"Le Pig\" for recording ''[[Broken (EP)|Broken]]'' (1992) and ''The Downward Spiral'' with collaborations from other musicians. The album was influenced by late-1970s rock music albums such as [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Wall]]'' in particular, and focused on texture and space.\n\nThe album spawned two singles, \"[[March of the Pigs]]\" and \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\", in addition to the promotional singles \"[[Piggy (song)|Piggy]]\" and \"[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]\". \"March of the Pigs\" and \"Closer\" were accompanied by music videos, with the former shot twice and the latter's heavily censored. \n\n''The Downward Spiral'' was a major commercial success, and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the [[1990s in music|1990s music scene]], with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media hype and multiple honors, while diverging into drug abuse and depression. It has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s, and was praised for its abrasive and eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for some of its lyrics. A [[remix album]] titled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'' was released in 1995.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:Adrian Belew (2006 - 02).jpg|thumb|left|[[Adrian Belew]] in 2006. Belew's approach to guitar parts on the album improved Reznor's confidence in the instrument.]]\n''The Downward Spiral'' was conceived after the Lollapalooza festival tour as Trent Reznor thought of a \"negative vibe\" felt by the band when they were in a European hotel. [[Nine Inch Nails live performances]] were known for its aggressive on-stage dynamic, in which band members act angry, injure themselves, and destroy instruments. Reznor had a [[Trent Reznor\u2013TVT Records feud|feud]] with [[TVT Records]] that resulted in him co-founding Nothing Records with his former manager [[John Malm, Jr.]] and signing with Interscope. He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the album's themes; he later used the concept as lyrics. The concept was based on Reznor's social issues at the time: he had personal conflicts with band member [[Richard Patrick]] and was known for enjoying [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].<ref name=\"Huxley\">{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Martin|title=Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct|date=September 1997|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=0-312-15612-X}}</ref><ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\" /><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Estlund |first=Kristina |date=November 1994 |title=Trent Speaks |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/rip1.shtml|magazine=[[Rip (magazine)|Rip]]|access-date=2017-08-24|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When developing ''The Downward Spiral'', Reznor struggled with drug addiction and was depressed as he wrote songs related to personal issues.

He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive \"terrifying\" because he already knew it and read books related to the incident.

Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':\n\n{{quote|While I was working on ''[The] Downward Spiral'', I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister [Patti Tate]. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: 'Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, 'No, it's just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred.' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don't want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, 'What if it was my sister?' I thought, 'Fuck [[Charles Manson|Charlie Manson]].' I went home and cried that night.

Chris Vrenna and [[James Woolley]] performed drums and keyboards respectively, [[Robin Finck]] replaced [[Richard Patrick]] on guitar and bassist [[Danny Lohner]] was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as \"Hurt\". The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very little actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=145\u2013148}}\n\nThe tour included a set at [[Woodstock '94]] broadcast on [[pay-per-view]] and seen in as many as 24&nbsp;million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have \"stolen the show\" from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=151\u2013153}}<ref name=\"PPV\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html|title=Feedback muddy from Woodstock PPV|last=Umstead|first=Thomas R.|newspaper=[[Multichannel News]]|date=1994-08-22|volume=15|issue=32|pages=3\u20134|accessdate=2017-08-23|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"DFP Woodstock\">{{cite newspaper|title=Band's Hot Image Rooted In Woodstock '94 Mud|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/detroit.shtml|last=Graff|first=Gary|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=1994-08-28|accessdate=2017-08-23|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Pit: Nine Inch Nails|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xreview1.shtml|magazine=Guitar School|publication-date=May 1995|accessdate=2017-10-15|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Its performance of \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" from the Woodstock concert earned the group a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 1995.<ref name=\"Huxley\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/38th-annual-grammy-awards|title=38th Annual GRAMMY Awards (1995)|work=grammy.com|accessdate=2017-08-23|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: \"Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core\u2014an experience as draining as it is exhilarating\".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2017-08-23|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart199.shtml|title=Trent Reznor : The Entertainers|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=1994-12-30|last=Hajari|first=Nisid|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nThe main leg of the tour featured Marilyn Manson as the supporting act, who featured bassist [[Jeordie White]] (then playing under the pseudonym \"Twiggy Ramirez\"); White later played bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.<ref name=\"break-up\">{{cite newspaper|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/09/14/features/story05.html|title=Reznor's edge cuts NIN's bleak outlook|last=Chun|first=Gary|newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|volume=12|issue=257|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2017-08-23|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After another tour leg supporting the remix album ''Further Down the Spiral'', Nine Inch Nails contributed to the [[Alternative Nation Festival]] in Australia and subsequently embarked on the [[Outside Tour|Dissonance Tour]], which included 26 separate performances with co-headliner David Bowie.

The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take longer than he expected, and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on ''Broken'' and ''Pretty Hate Machine''. He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993, only to experience a [[writer's block]] as he was unable to produce any satisfactory material.

Retrieved 2017-04-22.</ref> He began recording around Los Angeles in 1982 as a member of the Radio Crew, as well as Uncle Jamm's Army.\n\nMost of the Egyptian Lover's successful recordings were 12\" singles. He eventually released some of the earliest rap LPs, but they were less popular than his singles. On the strength of an alternate mix of his most popular single \"Egypt, Egypt\", 1984's ''On the Nile'' was moderately successful. After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 with ''Back from the Tomb'', his first full-length album in over ten years.\n\nThe Egyptian Lover also established his own record company, Egyptian Empire Records, which included artists such as [[Rodney O & Joe Cooley]].\n\nHis 2015 release, ''1984'', continues his tradition of using all [[Analogue electronics|analog]] equipment, including his famed [[Roland TR-808]] (which he is widely known as \"the king of\"), along with much of the same gear used on his recordings of the 1980s. The name \"1984\" refers to his earlier albums. The album was recorded at Skip Saylor, Encore Studios, and at RUSK Studios, the same studio where ''On The Nile'' was recorded in 1984. It is widely available on double gatefold LP, CD and cassette tape.\n\n===Currently===\n\n* 2005 \u2013 New single \"Party\", backed with \"Dancefloor\"\n* February 2006 \u2013 ''Platinum Pyramids'' was released\n* End of 2006 \u2013 Recorded \"UFO\" and \"Futuristic\" with Jamie Jupiter for Jupiter's new 12\" single (never released)\n* 2007 \u2013 Remade \"Modernaire\" by Dez Dickerson (from the film ''Purple Rain'') for the label [[Citinite]]\n* 2007 \u2013 Collaborated with Clone Machine and Egypt Ear Werk\n* December 2008 \u2013 Released exclusive songs on iTunes: \"Electro Pharaoh\", \"Freaky D.J.\", and \"Scandinavian Summer\"\n* 2008 \u2013 Joined Who Cares on the song \"They Killed the Radio\"\n* 2008 \u2013 Worked with Jamie Jones on the song \"Galactic Space Bar\"\n* 2008 \u2013 Worked with M.I.A. on \"Rock off Shake off\" for new artist Rye Rye\n* May 2009 \u2013 Collaborated with Debonaire on \"Do U Wanna Get Down?\" for a new Street Sounds compilation\n* May 2009 \u2013 New video \"Freaky D.J.\" with producer/director Victor Brooks a.k.a.

In a matter of decades after their creation in the 1830s, electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance.\n\t \t\nAll the known effects of electricity - such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]] - were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.\n\t\nIn 1753, an anonymous writer in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E. A.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].<ref name=\"Harvard1\" /> Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.<ref name=\"Harvard1\">Jones, R.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\nAt first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals; finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university were too poor to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835-6. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.\n\nIn 1836, an American scientist, Dr. [[David Alter]], invented the first known American electric telegraph, in Elderton, Pennsylvania, one year before the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|Cooke and Wheatstone]] and Morse telegraphs. Alter demonstrated it to witnesses but never developed the idea into a practical system.<ref>''Popular Science'', February 1882, '''vol.20''', no.28, p.568, Bonnier Corporation, {{ISSN|0161-7370}}.</ref> When Alter was interviewed for the book Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties, he said: \"I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself.... Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph.\"\n\n[[File:Cooke and Wheatstone electric telegraph.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|Cooke and Wheatstone's]] five-needle, six-wire telegraph]]\nThe Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, was co-developed by [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]]. In May 1837 they patented a telegraph system which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. The patent recommended five needles.\n\n[[File:Morsetaste.jpg|thumb|A Morse key (ca. 1900)]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]]. The first telegram in the United States was sent by Morse on 11 January 1838, across {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in|sigfig=1}} of wire at [[Speedwell Ironworks]] near Morristown, New Jersey, although it was only later, in 1844, that he sent the message \"[[Baltimore-Washington telegraph line|WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT]]\" over the {{convert|44|mi|km}} from the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in Washington to the [[B&O Railroad Museum|old Mt.

Although the patent recommended a five-needle system, its first commercial use was of a four-needle system that was installed on part of the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] being constructed by [[Robert Stephenson]]. It connected [[Euston railway station]] and [[Camden Town]], and was successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837.<ref>[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns] BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit. However, the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles.,{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|pp=67\u201368}}{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|p= 35}} As an interim measure, a two-needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires, which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes.<ref name=\"Mercer 7\">Mercer, page 7</ref> But when the line was extended to [[Slough]] in 1843, a one-needle, two-wire system was installed.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=69}}\n\nFrom this point the use of the electric telegraph started to grow on the new [[rail transport|railways]] being built from London. The [[London and Blackwall Railway]] (another rope-hauled application) was equipped with the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph when it opened in 1840, and many others followed.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|p= 35}} The one-needle telegraph proved highly successful on British railways, and 15,000 sets were still in use at the end of the nineteenth century. Some remained in service in the 1930s.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|pp=67-69}} In September 1845 the financier [[John Lewis Ricardo]] and Cooke formed the [[Electric Telegraph Company]], the first public telegraphy company in the world.

The era of mass personal communication had begun.\n\n===Telegraphic improvements===\n[[File:Components of the electromechanical telegraph network. Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 1000 words per hour, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York-Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\n[[File:Siemens T100 Telex.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] T100 Telex machine]]With the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures.\n\nBy the 1930s teleprinters were being produced by [[Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\n[[File:TTY33ASR.jpg|left|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]By 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union Telegraph Company|Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including: [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\nOne approach was to have oscillators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal (see [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]). These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of oscillators. With a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry thousands of telegraph signals simultaneously down a single line.)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. It was tried on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 1849, [[C.V. Walker]], electrician to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], submerged a two-mile wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.<ref name=Haigh26/>\n\n[[John Watkins Brett]], an engineer from [[Bristol]], sought and obtained permission from [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1847 to establish [[telegraph|telegraphic communication]] between France and England. The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean.

The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long [[transmission line]]s. The telegraph lines from Britain to India were connected in 1870 (those several companies combined to form the ''Eastern Telegraph Company'' in 1872).\n\nAustralia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.<ref>Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter: \"A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet\", p110.

Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts of Secretary of War, was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to ending at the War Department. Even Stanton himself said \"[telegraph] is my right arm\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Many Northern victories were found due to the use of the telegraph.

The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators.<ref name=\":1\" /> One source of irritation was that USMT operators didn't have to follow military authority, they usually performed without hesitation, but they didn't have to.<ref name=\":1\" /> To remedy this problem [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863.

While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{r|kennedy197110}} British access to transatlantic cables and its codebreaking expertise led to the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] incident that contributed to the US joining the war.<ref>{{cite news|title=The telegram that brought America into the First World War|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=BBC History Magazine|date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] revived the 'cable war' of 1914-1918.

Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system.<ref name=\":1\" /> Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time.<ref name=\":1\" /> Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphs as the long-range communication of choice.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.<ref name=\":1\" />  [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.

Today's filmmakers tend to skip the establishing shot in order to move the scene along more quickly, or merely mention the setting in on-screen text (as is done in the [[Law & Order (franchise)|''Law & Order'' franchise]]). In addition, the expositional nature of the shot (as described above) may be unsuitable to scenes in mysteries, where details are intentionally obscured or left out.\n\n==Use of establishing shots==\n;Location: Establishing shots may use famous landmarks to indicate the city where the action is taking place or has moved to, such as the following;\n*[[Brandenburg Gate]] to identify [[Berlin]]\n*[[Empire State Building]], the [[Statue of Liberty]] or the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]] to identify [[New York City]]\n*[[London Eye]], [[Big Ben]] or [[Piccadilly Circus]] to identify [[London]]\n*[[Sydney Opera House]] or the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] to identify [[Sydney]]\n*[[CN Tower]] to identify [[Toronto]]\n*[[Hollywood Sign]] to indicate [[Los Angeles]]\n*[[Eiffel Tower]] and/or the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to identify [[Paris]]\n*[[Shibuya#Shibuya Crossing|Shibuya Scramble Crossing]] to identify [[Tokyo]]\n*[[Las Vegas Strip]] to identify [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].<ref name=\"albany\">{{Cite web|title=CSI and Forensic Realism|publisher=University of Albany|date=|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol15is1/Deutsch_Cavender.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n;Time of day: Sometimes the viewer is guided in their understanding of the action. For example, an exterior shot of a building at night followed by an interior shot of people talking implies that the conversation is taking place at night inside that building - the conversation may in fact have been filmed on a studio set far from the apparent location, because of budget, permits, time limitations or convenience. In the series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', [[24-hour clock|24-hour]] [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (known in military nomenclature as \"Zulu time\") was used for these scenes to reinforce the military setting of the series.\n\n;Relationship: An establishing shot might be a long shot of a room that shows all the characters from a particular scene. For example, a scene about a murder in a college lecture hall might begin with a shot that shows the entire room, including the lecturing professor and the students taking notes. A close-up shot can also be used at the beginning of a scene to establish the setting (such as, for the lecture hall scene, a shot of a pencil writing notes).\n\n;Concept: An establishing shot may also establish a concept, rather than a location. For example, opening with a martial arts drill visually establishes the theme of martial arts. A shot of rain falling could be an establishing shot, followed by more and more detailed look at the rain, culminating with individual raindrops falling.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Continuity Editing}}\n{{Cinematic techniques}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Establishing Shot}}\n[[Category:Cinematic techniques]]\n[[Category:Film editing]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]", "sha1": "4z5vr3mouykf4uqiyvw310nz8owxeqm"}}, {"title": "Etruscan language", "ns": "0", "id": "9455", "revision": {"id": "865199329", "parentid": "861668450", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T12:10:41Z", "contributor": {"ip": "185.55.8.59"}, "comment": "\"https://jsbangs.com/2011/12/06/how-to-fail-at-making-a-language/\" is 'Citogenesis', ie wikipedia citing a quotation of wikipedia (the page here has said this longer than the 'source' has existed, the 'source' refers to wikipedia)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox language\n|name=Etruscan\n|image=[[File:Perugia, Museo archeologico Nazionale dell'Umbria, cippo di Perugia.jpg|267px]]\n|imagecaption=The [[Cippus Perusinus]], a stone tablet bearing 46 lines of incised Etruscan text, one of the longest extant Etruscan inscriptions. 3rd or 2nd century BC.\n|states=Ancient [[Etruria]]\n|region=[[Italian Peninsula]]\n|era=attested 700 BC to 100 AD\n|ref=linglist\n|familycolor=grey\n|fam1=[[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]]? \n|iso3=ett\n|glotto=etru1241\n|glottorefname=Etruscan\n|notice=IPA\n|map= Idioma etrusco.png\n|extinct = >AD 180|script = [[Old Italic script]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Etruscan language''' ({{IPAc-en|\u1d7b|\u02c8|t|r|\u028c|s|k|\u0259n}})<ref>Bauer, Laurie (2007).

Edinburgh.</ref> was the spoken and written language of the [[Etruscan civilization]], in Italy, in the ancient region of [[Etruria]] (modern [[Tuscany]] plus western [[Umbria]] and northern [[Latium]]) and in parts of [[Corsica]], [[Campania]], [[Veneto]], [[Lombardy]] and [[Emilia-Romagna]]. Etruscan influenced [[Latin]], but was eventually completely superseded by it. The Etruscans left around 13,000 inscriptions which have been found so far, only a small minority of which are of significant length; some bilingual inscriptions with texts also in Latin, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]; and a few dozen [[loanword]]s, such as the name [[Rome|Roma]], but Etruscan's influence was significant.\nAttested from 700 BC to AD 50, the relation of Etruscan to other languages has been a source of long-running speculation and study, with its being referred to at times as an [[language isolate|isolate]], one of the [[Tyrsenian languages]], and a number of other less well-known possibilities.\n\nGrammatically, the language is [[agglutinating]], with nouns and verbs showing suffixed inflectional endings and [[ablaut]] in some cases.\n\nNouns show four cases, singular and plural numbers, and masculine and feminine genders.\n\nPhonologically, Etruscan appears uncomplicated, with a four-[[vowel system]] and an apparent contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops. The language shows phonetic change over time, with the loss and then re-establishment of word-internal vowels due to the effect of Etruscan's strong word-initial stress.\n\n[[Etruscan religion]] influenced [[Religion in ancient Rome|that of the Romans]], and many of the few surviving Etruscan language artifacts are of votive or religious significance. Etruscan was written in [[Etruscan alphabet|an alphabet]] derived from the [[Greek alphabet]]; this alphabet was the source of the Latin alphabet. The Etruscan language is also believed to be the source of certain important cultural words of [[Western Europe]] such as 'military' and 'person', which do not have obvious Indo-European roots.\n\n==History of Etruscan literacy==\n[[File:Haruspex.png|thumb|left|250px|Drawing of the inscriptions on the [[Liver of Piacenza]]; see ''[[haruspex]]'']]\n\nEtruscan literacy was widespread over the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] shores, as evidenced by about 13,000 [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] (dedications, [[epitaph]]s, etc.), most fairly short, but some of considerable length.<ref name=bonfante12>Bonfante (1990), p. 12.</ref> They date from about 700 BC.<ref>Bonfante (1990), p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe Etruscans had a rich literature, as noted by Latin authors. [[Livy]] and [[Cicero]] were both aware that highly specialized Etruscan religious rites were codified in several sets of books written in Etruscan under the generic Latin title ''Etrusca Disciplina''. The ''Libri Haruspicini'' dealt with [[divination]] from the entrails of the sacrificed animal, while the ''Libri Fulgurales'' expounded the art of divination by observing [[lightning]]. A third set, the ''Libri Rituales'', might have provided a key to Etruscan civilization: its wider scope embraced Etruscan standards of social and political life, as well as ritual practices. According to the 4th century Latin writer [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], a fourth set of Etruscan books existed; dealing with animal gods, but it is unlikely that any scholar living in that era could have read Etruscan. However, only one book (as opposed to inscription), the ''[[Liber Linteus]]'', survived, and only because the linen on which it was written was used as [[mummy]] wrappings.<ref>Van der Meer, L. Bouke, ed. ''Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis'' (= ''Monographs on antiquity'', vol. 4). Peeters, 2007,  {{ISSN|1781-9458}}.</ref> By [[AD 100]], Etruscan had been replaced by Latin.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Around 180, the Latin author [[Aulus Gellius]] mentions Etruscan alongside the [[Gaulish language]] in an anecdote.<ref>Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae''.

The last person known to have been able to read Etruscan was the Roman emperor [[Claudius]] (10&nbsp;BC \u2013 AD&nbsp;54), who authored a treatise in 20&nbsp;volumes on the Etruscans, called ''Tyrrenik\u00e0'' (now lost), and compiled a dictionary (also lost) by interviewing the last few elderly [[wikt:countryfolk|rustics]] who still spoke the language.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], the emperor's first wife, was Etruscan.<ref>For Urgulanilla, see [[Suetonius]], ''Life of Claudius'', section 26.1; for the 20 books, same work, section 42.2.</ref>\n\nEtruscan had some influence on Latin, as a few dozen Etruscan words and names were borrowed by the Romans, some of which remain in modern languages, among which are possibly ''columna'' \"column\", ''voltur'' \"vulture\", ''tuba'' \"trumpet\", ''vagina'' \"sheath\", ''populus'' \"people\".<ref>Ostler, Nicholas (2009).

Several scholars believe that the [[Lemnian language]] could have arrived in the [[Aegean Sea]] during the Late [[Bronze Age]], when Mycenaean rulers recruited groups of mercenaries from [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]] and various parts of the Italian peninsula.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Ligt|first1=Luuk|title=An 'Eteocretan' inscription from Prasos and the homeland of the Sea Peoples|journal=Talanta|date=2008\u20132009|volume=XL-XLI|pages=151\u2013172|url=http://www.talanta.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/TAL-40-412008-2009-pag-151-172-DeLigt.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nThe [[phonology]] of Etruscan is known through the alternation of Greek and Etruscan letters in some inscriptions (for example, the [[Iguvine Tablets]]), and many individual words are known through loans into or from Greek and Latin, as well as explanations of Etruscan words by ancient authors. A few concepts of word formation have been formulated (see below).

In 1498, Annio published his antiquarian miscellany titled ''Antiquitatum variarum'' (in 17 volumes) where he put together a theory in which both the [[Hebrew]] and Etruscan languages were said to originate from a single source, the \"Aramaic\" spoken by [[Noah]] and his descendants, founders of the Etruscan city, [[Viterbo]]. Annio also started to excavate Etruscan tombs, unearthing sarcophagi and inscriptions, and made a bold attempt at deciphering the Etruscan language.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe 19th century saw numerous attempts to reclassify Etruscan. Ideas of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origins found supporters until this time. In 1858, the last attempt was made by [[Johann Gustav Stickel]], [[Jena University]] in his ''Das Etruskische [\u2026] als semitische Sprache erwiesen''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Etruskische durch Erkl\u00e4rung von Inschriften und Namen als semitische Sprache erwiesen|last=Stickel|first=Johann Gustav|publisher=Wilhelm Engelmann|place=Leipzig|year=1858}}</ref> A reviewer<ref>Gildemeister, Johannes. In: ''ZDMG'' '''13''' (1859), pp. 289\u2013304.</ref> concluded that Stickel brought forward every possible argument which would speak for that hypothesis, but he proved the opposite of what he had attempted to do. In 1861, Robert Ellis proposed that Etruscan was related to [[Armenian language|Armenian]], which is nowadays acknowledged as an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language.<ref>Ellis, Robert (1861). ''The Armenian origin of the Etruscans''.

''The Etruscans Begin to Speak''. Translation by Patrick Evans. London: Souvenir Press.</ref>\n\nSeveral theories from the late 19th and early 20th centuries connected Etruscan to [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] or even [[Altaic languages]]. In 1874, the British scholar [[Isaac Taylor (priest)|Isaac Taylor]] brought up the idea of a genetic relationship between Etruscan and [[Hungarian Language|Hungarian]], of which also [[Jules Martha]] would approve in his exhaustive study ''La langue \u00e9trusque'' (1913).<ref name=\"szabir.com\" /> In 1911, the French orientalist Baron Carra de Vaux suggested a connection between Etruscan and the [[Altaic languages]].<ref name=\"szabir.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.szabir.com/blog/etruscans-huns-and-hungarians/ |title=Etruscans, Huns and Hungarians|author=Alfr\u00e9d T\u00f3th |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302115355/http://www.szabir.com/blog/etruscans-huns-and-hungarians/ |archivedate=March 2, 2010 }}</ref> The Hungarian connection was recently revived by [[Mario Alinei]], Emeritus Professor of Italian Languages at the [[University of Utrecht]].<ref>Alinei, Mario (2003).

This system is ultimately derived from [[history of the alphabet|West Semitic scripts]].\n\nThe Etruscans recognized a 26-letter alphabet, which makes an early appearance incised for decoration on a small [[bucchero]] terracotta lidded vase in the shape of a cockerel at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ca 650\u2013600 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/etruscan/a/bucchero|title=Bucchero|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> The full complement of 26 has been termed the model alphabet.<ref>Bonfantes (2002) page 55.</ref> The Etruscans did not use four letters of it, mainly because Etruscan did not have the voiced stops ''b'', ''d'' and ''g''; and also no ''o''. They innovated one letter for ''f''.<ref name=\"bonfantech2\" />\n\n===Text===\nWriting was from right to left except in archaic inscriptions, which occasionally used [[boustrophedon]]. An example found at [[Cerveteri]] used left to right. In the earliest inscriptions, the words are continuous. From the sixth century BC, they are separated by a dot or a colon, which symbol might also be used to separate syllables. Writing was phonetic; the letters represented the sounds and not conventional spellings. On the other hand, many inscriptions are highly abbreviated and often casually formed, so the identification of individual letters is sometimes difficult. Spelling might vary from city to city, probably reflecting differences of pronunciation.<ref>The Bonfantes (2002) page 56.</ref>\n\n===Complex consonant clusters===\nSpeech featured a heavy stress on the first syllable of a word, causing [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncopation]] by weakening of the remaining vowels, which then were not represented in writing: ''Alcsntre'' for ''Alexandros'', ''Rasna'' for ''Rasena''.<ref name=\"bonfantech2\" /> This speech habit is one explanation of the Etruscan \"impossible consonant clusters\". The [[Sonorant|resonants]], however, may have been syllabic, accounting for some of the clusters (see below under [[#Consonants|Consonants]]). In other cases, the scribe sometimes inserted a vowel: Greek ''H\u0113rakl\u0113s'' became ''Hercle'' by syncopation and then was expanded to ''Herecele''. Pallottino<ref>Page 261</ref> regarded this variation in vowels as \"instability in the quality of vowels\" and accounted for the second phase (e.g. ''Herecele'') as \"[[vowel harmony]], i.e., of the assimilation of vowels in neighboring syllables ....\"\n\n===Phases===\nThe writing system had two historical phases: the archaic from the seventh to fifth centuries BC, which used the early Greek alphabet, and the later from the fourth to first centuries BC, which modified some of the letters. In the later period, syncopation increased.\n\nThe alphabet went on in modified form after the language disappeared. In addition to being the source of the Roman alphabet, it has been suggested that it passed northward into [[Veneto]] and from there through [[Raetia]] into the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] lands, where it became the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, the oldest form of the [[runes]].<ref>The Bonfantes (2002), page 117 following.</ref>\n\n==Corpus==\nThe Etruscan corpus is edited in the ''Thesaurus Linguae Etruscae'' (TLE).<ref>\nMassimo Pallottino, Maristella Pandolfini Angeletti,   ''Thesaurus linguae Etruscae'', Volume 1 (1978); review by A.

The tombs are the main source of Etruscan portables, provenance unknown, in collections throughout the world. Their incalculable value has created a brisk black market in Etruscan ''objets d'art'' \u2013 and equally brisk law enforcement effort, as it is illegal to remove any objects from Etruscan tombs without authorization from the Italian government.\n\nThe magnitude of the task involved in cataloguing them means that the total number of tombs is unknown. They are of many types. Especially plentiful are the [[hypogeum|hypogeal]] or \"underground\" chambers or system of chambers cut into [[tuff]] and covered by a [[tumulus]]. The interior of these tombs represents a habitation of the living stocked with furniture and favorite objects. The walls may display painted [[mural]]s, the predecessor of wallpaper. Tombs identified as Etruscan date from the [[Villanovan]] period to about 100 BC, when presumably the cemeteries were abandoned in favor of Roman ones.<ref>Some Internet articles on the tombs in general are:<br>\n''[http://www.mysteriousetruscans.com/tombs.html Etruscan Tombs]'' at mysteriousetruscans.com.<br>\n''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,936863,00.html Scientific Tomb-Robbing]'', article in ''Time'', Monday, Feb. 25, 1957, displayed at time.com.<br>\n''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907013,00.html Hot from the Tomb: The Antiquities Racket]'', article in ''Time'', Monday, Mar. 26, 1973, displayed at time.com.</ref> Some of the major cemeteries are as follows:\n*[[Caere]] or [[Cerveteri]], a [[UNESCO]] site.<ref name=cervtarq>Refer to [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1158 Etruscan Necropoleis of Cerveteri and Tarquinia], a World Heritage site.</ref> Three complete [[necropoleis]] with streets and squares.

''Speculum'' is Latin; the Etruscan word is ''malena'' or ''malstria''. Specula were cast in bronze as one piece or with a tang into which a wooden, bone, or ivory handle fitted. The reflecting surface was created by polishing the flat side. A higher percentage of tin in the mirror improved its ability to reflect. The other side was convex and featured [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] or [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] scenes from mythology. The piece was generally ornate.<ref>For pictures and a description refer to the ''[http://www.mysteriousetruscans.com/art/mirrors.html Etruscan Mirrors]'' article at mysteriousetruscans.com.</ref>\n\nAbout 2,300 specula are known from collections all over the world. As they were popular plunderables, the provenance of only a minority is known. An estimated time window is 530\u2013100 BC.<ref>For the dates, more pictures and descriptions, see the ''[http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Etruscan.htm Hand Mirror with the Judgment of Paris]'' article published online by the Allen Memorial Art Museum of [[Oberlin College]].</ref> Most probably came from tombs.\n\nMany bear inscriptions naming the persons depicted in the scenes, so they are often called picture bilinguals. In 1979, [[Massimo Pallottino]], then president of the ''Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici'' initiated the Committee of the ''Corpus Speculorum Etruscanorum'', which resolved to publish all the specula and set editorial standards for doing so.\n\nSince then, the committee has grown, acquiring local committees and representatives from most institutions owning Etruscan mirror collections. Each collection is published in its own fascicle by diverse Etruscan scholars.<ref>Representative examples can be found in the U.S. Epigraphy Project site of [[Brown University]]: [http://usepigraphy.brown.edu/view.php?textID=OH.Tol.TMA.L.1980.1340] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512185430/http://usepigraphy.brown.edu/view.php?textID=OH.Tol.TMA.L.1980.1340 |date=2007-05-12 }}, [http://usepigraphy.brown.edu/view.php?textID=NY.NY.MMA.L.96.18.16] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904033701/http://usepigraphy.brown.edu/view.php?textID=NY.NY.MMA.L.96.18.16 |date=2006-09-04 }}</ref>\n\n====Cistae====\nA cista is a bronze container of circular, ovoid, or more rarely rectangular shape used by women for the storage of sundries. They are ornate, often with feet and lids to which figurines may be attached. The internal and external surfaces bear carefully crafted scenes usually from mythology, usually intaglio, or rarely part intaglio, part [[cameo (carving)|cameo]].\n\nCistae date from the [[Roman Republic]] of the fourth and third centuries BC in Etruscan contexts. They may bear various short inscriptions concerning the manufacturer or owner or subject matter. The writing may be Latin, Etruscan, or both. Excavations at [[Palestrina|Praeneste]], an Etruscan city which became Roman, turned up about 118 cistae, one of which has been termed \"the Praeneste cista\" or \"the Ficoroni cista\" by art analysts, with special reference to the one manufactured by Novios Plutius and given by Dindia Macolnia to her daughter, as the archaic Latin inscription says. All of them are more accurately termed \"the Praenestine cistae\".<ref>Paggi, Maddalena. \"The Praenestine Cistae\" (October 2004), New York: The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], in [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prae/hd_prae.htm Timeline of Art History].</ref>\n\n====Rings and ringstones====\nAmong the most plunderable portables from the Etruscan tombs of [[Etruria]] are the finely engraved gemstones set in patterned gold to form circular or ovoid pieces intended to go on finger rings.

The engravings, mainly cameo, but sometimes intaglio, depict [[Dung beetle|scarabs]] at first and then scenes from Greek mythology, often with heroic personages called out in Etruscan. The gold setting of the bezel bears a border design, such as cabling.\n\n====Coins====\nEtruscan-minted coins can be dated between 5th and 3rd centuries BC. Use of the 'Chalcidian' standard, based on the silver unit of 5.8&nbsp;grams, indicates that this custom, like the alphabet, came from Greece. Roman coinage later supplanted Etruscan, but the basic Roman coin, the ''[[sesterce]]'', is believed to have been based on the 2.5-denomination Etruscan coin.<ref>[http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/etruria.html Ancient Coins of Etruria].</ref> Etruscan coins have turned up in caches or individually in tombs and in excavations seemingly at random, and concentrated, of course, in [[Etruria]].\n\nEtruscan coins were in gold, silver, and bronze, the gold and silver usually having been struck on one side only. The coins often bore a denomination, sometimes a minting authority name, and a cameo motif. Gold denominations were in units of silver; silver, in units of bronze. Full or abbreviated names are mainly Pupluna ([[Populonia]]), Vatl or Veltuna ([[Vetulonia]]), Velathri ([[Volaterrae]]), Velzu or Velznani (Volsinii) and Cha for Chamars ([[Camars]]). Insignia are mainly heads of mythological characters or depictions of mythological beasts arranged in a symbolic motif: [[Apollo]], [[Zeus]], [[Culsans]], [[Athena]], [[Hermes]], [[griffin]], [[gorgon]], male [[sphinx]], [[hippocamp]], bull, snake, eagle, or other creatures which had symbolic significance.\n\n==Phonology==\nIn the tables below, conventional letters used for transliterating Etruscan are accompanied by likely pronunciation in [[help:IPA|IPA]] symbols within the square brackets, followed by examples of the early [[Etruscan alphabet]] which would have corresponded to these sounds:{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe Etruscan [[vowel|vowel system]] consisted of four distinct vowels. Vowels \"o\" and \"u\" appear to have not been phonetically distinguished based on the nature of the writing system, as only one symbol is used to cover both in loans from Greek (e.g. Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ce\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd}} ''k\u014dth\u014dn'' > Etruscan ''qutun'' \"pitcher\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

There were no voiced stops and loanwords with them were typically devoiced, e.g. Greek ''thriambos'' was borrowed by Etruscan, becoming ''triumpus'' and ''triumphus'' in Latin.<ref>J.H. Adams pages 163\u2013164.</ref>\n\n====Syllabic theory====\nBased on standard spellings by Etruscan scribes of words without vowels or with unlikely consonant clusters (e.g. ''cl'' 'of this (gen.)' and ''lautn'' 'freeman'), it is likely that {{IPA|/m n l r/}} were sometimes syllabic [[sonorant]]s (cf. English \"litt'''le'''\", \"butto'''n'''\"). Thus ''cl'' {{IPA|/kl\u0329/}} and ''lautn'' {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u0251wtn\u0329/}}.\n\nRix postulates several syllabic consonants, namely {{IPA|/l, r, m, n/}} and palatal {{IPA|/l\u02b2, r\u02b2, n\u02b2/}} as well as a labiovelar spirant {{IPA|/x\u02b7/}} and some scholars such as [[Mauro Cristofani]] also view the aspirates as palatal rather than aspirated but these views are not shared by most Etruscologists. Rix supports his theories by means of variant spellings such as am\u03c6are/am\u03c6iare, lar\u03b8al/lar\u03b8ial, aran\u03b8/aran\u03b8iia.\n\n==Morphology==\nEtruscan was [[Inflected language|inflected]], varying the endings of nouns, pronouns and verbs. It also had adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions, which were uninflected.\n\n===Nouns===\nEtruscan substantives had five cases, and a singular and a plural. Not all five cases are attested for every word. Nouns merge the nominative and accusative; pronouns do not generally merge these. Gender appears in personal names (masculine and feminine) and in pronouns (animate and inanimate); otherwise, it is not marked.<ref name = \"hwiaof\">Bonfante (1990), page 20.</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[Indo-European languages]], Etruscan noun endings were more [[agglutinative]], with some nouns bearing two or three agglutinated suffixes. For example, where Latin would have distinct nominative plural and dative plural endings, Etruscan would suffix the case ending to a plural marker: Latin nominative singular ''fili-us'', \"son\", plural ''fili-i'', dative plural ''fili-is'', but Etruscan ''clan, clen-ar'' and ''clen-ar-a\u015bi''.<ref>Bonfante (1990) page 19.</ref> <!--Need a different set of example as this one shows similar way of adding suffix in both Latin and Etruscan language 's' added to 'i' and 'a\u015bi' added to 'ar'--> Moreover, Etruscan nouns could bear multiple suffixes from the case paradigm alone: that is, Etruscan exhibited ''[[Suffixaufnahme]]''. Pallottino calls this phenomenon \"morphological redetermination\", which he defines as \"the typical tendency ... to redetermine the syntactical function of the form by the superposition of suffices.\"<ref>Page 263.</ref> His example is'' Uni-al-\u03b8i'', \"in the sanctuary of Juno\", where'' -al'' is a genitive ending and ''-\u03b8i'' a locative.\n\nSteinbauer says of Etruscan, \"there can be more than one marker ... to design a case, and ... the same marker can occur for more than one case.\"<ref>''[http://www.etruskisch.de/pgs/gr.htm Etruscan Grammar: Summary]'' at Steinbauer's website.</ref>\n\n; [[Nominative case|Nominative]]/[[accusative case]] : No distinction is made between nominative and accusative of nouns. Common nouns use the unmarked root. Names of males may end in ''-e'': ''Hercle'' (Hercules), ''Achle'' (Achilles), ''Tite'' (Titus); of females, in -i, -a, or -u: ''Uni'' (Juno), ''Menrva'' (Minerva), or ''Zipu''. Names of gods may end in -s: ''Fufluns, Tins''; or they may be the unmarked stem ending in a vowel or consonant: ''Aplu'' (Apollo), ''Pa\u03c7a'' (Bacchus), or ''Turan''.\n; [[Genitive case]] : Pallottino defines two declensions based on whether the genitive ends in -s/-\u015b or -l.<ref>Page 264.</ref> In the -s group are most noun stems ending in a vowel or a consonant: ''fler/fler-\u015b, ramtha/ramtha-\u015b''. In the second are names of females ending in i and names of males that end s, th or n: ''ati/ati-al, Laris/Laris-al, Arn\u03b8/Arn\u03b8-al''. After l or r -us instead of -s appears: ''Vel/Vel-us''. Otherwise, a vowel might be placed before the ending: ''Arn\u03b8-al'' instead of ''Arn\u03b8-l''.\n: There is a [[patronymic]] ending: -sa or -isa, \"son of\", but the ordinary genitive might serve that purpose. In the genitive case, morphological redetermination becomes elaborate. Given two male names, ''Vel'' and ''Avle'', ''Vel Avle\u015b'' means \"Vel son of Avle.\" This expression in the genitive become ''Vel-u\u015b Avles-la''. Pallottino's example of a three-suffix form is ''Arn\u03b8-al-i\u015ba-la''.\n; [[Dative case]] : The dative ending is -si: ''Tita/Tita-si''.<ref name = \"hwiaof\"/>\n; [[Locative case]] : The locative ending is -\u03b8i: ''Tar\u03c7na/Tar\u03c7na-l-\u03b8i''.<ref>Pallottino page 114, Bonfante (1990) page 41.</ref>\n; [[Plural number]] : In one case, a plural is given for ''clan'', \"son\", as ''clenar'', \"sons\". This shows both [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and an ending ''-ar''. Plurals for cases other than nominative are made by agglutinating the case ending on ''clenar''.\n\n===Pronouns===\nPersonal pronouns refer to persons; demonstrative pronouns point out: English this, that, there.<ref>The summary in this section is taken from the tables of the Bonfantes (2002) pages 91\u201394, which go into considerably more detail, citing examples.</ref>\n\n====Personal====\nThe first-person personal pronoun has a nominative ''mi'' (\"I\") and an accusative ''mini'' (\"me\").  The third person has a personal form ''an'' (\"he\" or \"she\") and an inanimate ''in'' (\"it\"). The second person is uncertain, but some like the Bonfantes have claimed a dative singular ''une'' (\"to thee\") and an accusative singular ''un'' (\"thee\").\n\n====Demonstrative====\nThe demonstratives, ''ca'' and ''ta'', are used without distinction. The nominative\u2013accusative singular forms are: ''ica, eca, ca, ita, ta''; the plural: ''cei, tei''. There is a genitive singular: ''cla, tla, cal'' and plural ''clal''. The accusative singular: ''can, cen, cn, ecn, etan, tn''; plural ''cnl''. Locative singular: ''calti, cei\u03b8i, cl\u03b8(i), ecl\u03b8i''; plural ''caiti, cei\u03b8i''.\n\n===Adjectives===\nThough uninflected, adjectives fall into a number of types formed from nouns with a suffix:\n* quality, -u, -iu or -c:'' ais/ais-iu'', \"god/divine\"; ''zama\u03b8i/zam\u03b8i-c'', \"gold/golden\"\n* possession or reference, -na, -ne, -ni: ''pa\u03c7a/pa\u03c7a-na'', \"Bacchus, Bacchic\"; ''laut/laut-ni'', \"family/familiar\" (in the sense of servant)\n* collective, -cva, -chva, -cve, -\u03c7ve, -ia: ''sren/sren-cva'': \"figure/figured\"; ''etera/etera-ia'', \"slave/servile\"\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs are unmarked: ''etnam'', \"again\"; ''\u03b8ui'', \"now\"; ''\u03b8uni'', \"at first.\" Most [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] adverbs are formed from the oblique cases, which become unproductive and descend to fixed forms. Cases such as the [[ablative]] are therefore called \"adverbial\". If there is any such system in Etruscan, it is not obvious from the relatively few surviving adverbs.\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs had an [[indicative mood]] and an [[imperative mood]]. Tenses were [[Present tense|present]] and [[Past tense|past]]. The past tense had an [[active voice]] and a [[grammatical voice|passive voice]].\n\n====Present active====\nEtruscan used a verbal root with a zero suffix or -a without distinction to number or person: ''ar, ar-a'', \"he, she, we, you, they make\".\n\n====Past or preterite active====\nAdding the suffix ''-(a)ce'' to the verb root produces a third-person singular active, which has been called variously a \"past\", a \"preterite\", a \"perfect\" or an \"aorist\". In contrast to Indo-European, this form is not marked for [[Grammatical person|person]]. Examples: ''tur/tur-ce'', \"gives/gave\"; ''sval/sval-ce'', \"lives/lived.\"\n\n====Past passive====\nThe third-person past passive is formed with -che: ''mena/mena-ce/mena-che'', \"offers/offered/was offered\".\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Borrowings from Etruscan===\nOnly a few hundred words of the Etruscan vocabulary are understood with some certainty. The exact count depends on whether the different forms and the expressions are included. Below is a table of some of the words grouped by topic.<ref>The words in this table come from the Glossaries of Bonfante (1990) and Pallottino. The latter also gives a grouping by topic on pages 275 following, the last chapter of the book.</ref>\n\nSome words with corresponding Latin or other Indo-European forms are likely [[loanword]]s to or from Etruscan. For example, ''neft\u015b'' \"nephew\", is probably from Latin (Latin ''nep\u014ds, nep\u014dtis''; this is a cognate of German ''Neffe'', Old Norse ''nefi''). A number of [[wikt:Category:Latin terms derived from Etruscan|words and names]] for which Etruscan origin has been proposed survive in Latin.\n\nAt least one Etruscan word has an apparent Semitic origin: ''talitha'' \"girl\" (Aramaic; could have been transmitted by Phoenicians). The word ''pera'' \"house\" is a [[false cognate]] to the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''per'' \"house\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-etruscan-language/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602084951/http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-etruscan-language/ |archive-date=2015-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to words believed to have been borrowed into Etruscan from Indo-European or elsewhere, there is a corpus of words such as ''familia'' which seem to have been borrowed into Latin from the older Etruscan civilization as a [[linguistic superstratum|superstrate]] influence.<ref>''Germania Semitica, \nTheo Vennemann,\np 123,\nWalter de Gruyter,\n2012</ref> Some of these words still have widespread currency in English and Latin-influenced languages.

In the words of Larissa Bonfante (1990), \"What these numerals show, beyond any shadow of a doubt, is the non-Indo-European nature of the Etruscan language\".<ref>Bonfante, L.,''Etruscan'', University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1990), page 22.</ref> Conversely, other scholars, including [[Francisco Rodr\u00edguez Adrados|Francisco R.

Males, the dominate cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] and continue to do so in many countries.<ref name = Brit/> Early elections in countries such as the [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Elections in the United States|the United States]] were dominated by [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[ruling class]] males.<ref name = Brit/> However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider [[women's suffrage]].<ref name = Brit/> Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see [[civil rights movement]]).<ref name = Brit/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Suffrage===\nThe question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting. \n\nIn Australia Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum entry]]) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners to vote (a large proportion of which are Aboriginal Australians).\n\nSuffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.\n\nHowever, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required. \n[[File:ElezioneMilano.jpg|thumb|right|Campaigners working on posters in [[Milan]], Italy, 2004]]\nIn some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Nomination===\nA [[representative democracy]] requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through [[preselection]] processes in organized political parties.<ref>Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds), ''Comparing Democracies 2'', Sage Publications, London, 2002</ref>\n\nNon-partisan systems tend to differ from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a [[direct democracy]], one type of [[non-partisan democracy]], any eligible person can be nominated. In some non-partisan representative. History of elections. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century. systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting\u2014with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement\u2014in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).\n\nAs far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular can be nominated.  Or, any eligible person can be nominated through a ; thus allowing him or her to be listed.\n\n===Electoral systems===\nElectoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and [[voting system]]s that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various [[vote counting systems]] and [[ballot]] types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either [[Proportional representation|proportional]] or [[majoritarian]].  Among the former are [[party-list proportional representation]] and [[additional member system]].  Among the latter are [[First Past the Post electoral system|First Pas the Post (FPP)]] (relative majority) and [[absolute majority]].  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as [[approval voting]], [[single transferable vote]], [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]] or a [[Condorcet method]]; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.\n\nWhile openness and [[accountability]] are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.  The [[secret ballot]] is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.\n\n===Scheduling===\nThe nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the [[President of Ireland]] is elected every seven years, the [[President of Russia]] and the [[President of Finland]] every six years, the [[President of France]] every five years, [[President of the United States]] every four years.\n\nPre-determined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving the legislature]] (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]]) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a [[motion of no-confidence]]). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.\n\n===Election campaigns===\n{{main article|Political campaign}}\nWhen elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize [[campaign advertising]]. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via [[Political Forecasting]] methods.\n\nThe most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the [[United States presidential election, 2012]] and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the [[Indian general election, 2014]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.ndtv.com/elections/article/election-2014/india-s-spend-on-elections-could-challenge-us-record-report-493685\n| title = India's spend on elections could challenge US record: report\n| website = NDTV.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-25\n}}</ref>\n\n===Difficulties with elections===\n{{main article|Electoral fraud|Unfair election}}[[File:Voting under military protection in Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Election Proceedings in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayres]]: Voting under military protection (''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', [[26 March]] [[1892]]).]]\n\nIn many countries with weak [[rule of law]], the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being \"free and fair\" is interference from the incumbent government. [[Dictator]]s may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival<ref name=\"Brit\" /> faction due to an election.\n\nNon-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being \"free and fair\" take various forms:<ref>{{cite web|title=Free and Fair Elections|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/free-and-fair-elections|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Early voting]] has been criticized as harmful to democracy.\n\n====Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate====\nThe electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of [[freedom of the press]], lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media. [[Freedom of speech]] may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state [[propaganda]].\n\n====Unfair rules====\n\n[[File:The Presidential Election in Argentina, the Polling-Station at the Church of La Merced, Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Presidential Election in [[Argentina]], the Polling-Station at the [[Church of La Merced]], [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayres]]. \"The rival voters were kept back by an armed force of police out of sight to other Only batches of two or three were allowed to enter the polling-office at a time. Armed sentries guarded the gates and the doors leading to the office, and were also posted on the roofs of adjoining houses and in the belfry and tower of the church.\" ([[Godefroy Durand|G. Durand]], ''[[The Graphic]]'', [[21 May]] [[1892]]).]]\n\n[[Gerrymandering]], exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like [[ballot access]] rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.\n\n====Interference with campaigns====\nThose in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence. [[Foreign electoral intervention]] can also occur.\n\n====Tampering with the election mechanism====\n\nThis can include confusing or misleading voters about how to vote, violation of the [[secret ballot]], [[ballot stuffing]], tampering with voting machines, destruction of legitimately cast ballots, [[voter suppression]], voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places.\n\nOther examples include persuading candidates into not standing against them, such as through blackmailing, bribery, intimidation or physical violence in the History of elections. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, Rome,in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century.\n\n== Sham election ==\nA '''sham election''' is an election that is held purely for show; that is, without any significant political choice or real impact on results of election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sham-election/|title=Sham Election Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}</ref>\n\nShow elections are a common event in [[Dictator|dictatorial]] regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. Published results usually show nearly 100% [[voter turnout]] and high support (close to 100% in many cases) for the prescribed candidate(s) or for the [[referendum]] choice that favors the [[political party]] in power. Dictatorial regimes can also organize show elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-wins-100-of-the-vote-in-north-korean-elections-9180814.html</ref>\n\nSometimes only one government approved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges or even without any charges before the election to prevent them from running.<ref>https://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html</ref><ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/29/egyptian-opposition-calls-boycott-elections-challengers-arrested/</ref><ref name=\"urlAlexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election | The Independent\">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/alexei-navalny-latest-updates-russia-president-election-opposition-leader-putin-protests-a8222956.html |title=Alexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election &#124; The Independent |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Examples===\nExamples of such elections are [[Elections in Italy|Elections]] in [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] in [[Italian general election, 1929|1929]] and [[Italian general election, 1934|1934]], [[Elections in Germany#Elections in Nazi Germany|elections]] in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Portuguese presidential election, 1958]], most [[Communist state|communist]] and [[Socialist state|socialist states]] ([[Elections in East Germany|East Germany]], [[Elections in the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]], [[Elections in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Elections in North Korea|North Korea]], etc.), and [[Baathist Iraq|Baathist]] [[Elections in Iraq#History|Iraq]]. A predetermined conclusion is always established by the regime, either through suppression of the opposition, coercion of voters, [[Electoral fraud|vote rigging]], a forged number of \"votes received\" (e.g. the [[State of Vietnam referendum, 1955]]), outright lying, or some combination. In an extreme example, [[Charles D. B. King]] of [[Liberia]] claimed he received 243,000 votes in the [[Liberian general election, 1927|1927 general election]], which exceeded the number of eligible voters over 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/1927ElectionsMF.htm|title=Liberia past and present 1927 elections|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Coercion ===\nBallots in a show election may contain only one \"yes\" option. In the case of a simple \"yes or no\" question, people who pick \"no\" are often persecuted, thus making the \"yes\" choice the only option ([[false dilemma]]). An example of this is the elections of the [[People's Parliament|People's Parliaments]] in [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]], and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] in 1940 shortly after the Soviet [[occupation of the Baltic states]]; those who voted received stamps in their passport for voting and those who did not vote did not receive stamps and were persecuted as [[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]], and in modern [[North Korea]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764407,00.html|title=RUSSIA: Justice in The Baltic|date=1940-08-19|work=Time|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref><ref name=\"urlYes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Heres How They Work - The Atlantic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/north-korea-elections-guide/358875/ |title=Yes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Here's How They Work - The Atlantic |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, show elections can backfire against the party in power, especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion or fraud. The most famous example of this was the [[Myanmar general election, 1990|1990 Myanmar general election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/26/burma-20-years-after-1990-elections-democracy-still-denied|title=Burma: 20 Years After 1990 Elections, Democracy Still Denied|date=2010-05-26|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Ballot access]]\n*[[Criticisms of electoral politics]]\n*[[Concession (politics)]]\n*[[Demarchy]]\u2014\"Democracy without Elections\"\n*[[Electoral calendar]]\n*[[Electoral integrity]]\n*[[Election law]]\n*[[Election litter]]\n*[[Elections by country]]\n*[[Electronic voting]]\n*[[Fenno's paradox]]\n*[[Full slate]]\n*[[Garrat Elections]]\n*[[Gerontocracy]]\n*[[Issue voting]]\n*[[Landslide election]]\n*[[Meritocracy]]\n*[[Multi-party system]]\n*[[Nomination rules]]\n*[[Party system]]\n*[[Pluralism (political philosophy)]]\n*[[Political science]]\n*[[Polling station]]\n*[[Reelection]]\n*[[Slate (elections)|Slate]]\n*[[Two-party system]]\n*[[Voter turnout]]\n*[[Voting system]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kenneth Arrow|Arrow, Kenneth J.]] 1963.

It is located almost exactly in the centre of the county, between the Upper and Lower sections of [[Lough Erne]]. It had a population of 13,823 in the 2011 census. It was the seat of local government for the former [[Fermanagh District Council]], and is the [[county town]] of Fermanagh as well as its largest town.\n\n== History ==\nThe town's name comes from the {{lang-ga|Inis Ceithleann}}. This refers to [[Cethlenn]], a figure in [[Irish mythology]] who may have been a goddess. Local legend has it that Cethlenn was wounded in battle by an arrow and attempted to swim across the [[River Erne]], which surrounds the island, but she never reached the other side, so the island was named in reference to her. It has been [[anglicisation|anglicised]] many ways over the centuries \u2013 ''Iniskellen'', ''Iniskellin'', ''Iniskillin'', ''Iniskillen'', ''Inishkellen'', ''Inishkellin'', ''Inishkillin'', ''Inishkillen'' and so on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/?text=enniskillen&placeID=1167106|title=Bunachar Logainmneacha na h\u00c9ireann|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe town's oldest building is [[Enniskillen Castle]], built by Hugh (Maguire) the Hospitable who died in 1428.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Rogers|title=Prospect of Fermanagh|publisher=Watergate Press, Enniskillen|year=1982}}</ref> An earthwork, the Skonce on the shore of [[Lough Erne]], may be the remains of an earlier [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte]]. The castle was the stronghold of the junior branch of the [[Maguire (surname)|Maguire]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/MaguiresDuffysHibernian2-10/index.php|title=The Maguires of Fermanagh}}</ref> The first [[Watergate (architecture)|watergate]] was built around 1580 by [[C\u00fa Chonnacht Maguire]], though subsequent lowering of the level of the lough has left it without water. The strategic position of the castle made its capture important for the English in 1593, to support their plans for the control of [[Ulster]]; this was achieved by a Captain Dowdall in February 1594. Maguire then laid [[siege]] to it, and defeated a relieving force at the [[Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits]] at Drumane Bridge on the [[Arney River]]. Although the defenders were relieved, Maguire gained possession of the castle from 1595 to 1598 and it was not finally captured by the English until 1607.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Enniskillen High Street.jpg|thumb|240px|Enniskillen high street]] -->\n\nThis was part of a wider campaign to bring the province of Ulster under English control; the final capture of Enniskillen Castle in 1607 was followed by the [[Plantation of Ulster]], during which the lands of the native Irish were seized and handed over to planters loyal to the English Crown. The Maguires were supplanted by William Cole, originally from [[Devon]], who was appointed by James I to build an English settlement there.\n\nCaptain Cole was installed as Constable and strengthened the castle wall and built a \"fair house\" on the old foundation as the centrepoint of the county town. The first Protestant parish church was erected on the hilltop in 1627. The [[Portora Royal School|Royal Free School of Fermanagh]] was moved onto the island in 1643. The first bridges were drawbridges; permanent bridges were not installed before 1688.\n\nBy 1689 the town had grown significantly. During the conflict which resulted from the ousting of King [[James II of England|James II]] by his Protestant rival, [[William III of England|William III]], Enniskillen and [[siege of Derry|Derry]] were the focus of Williamite resistance in Ireland, including the nearby [[Battle of Newtownbutler]].<ref>[[Thomas Witherow|Witherow, Thomas]]. [http://www.libraryireland.com/Derry1689/VI-1.php \"The Defence of Enniskillen\"]. ''Derry and Enniskillen in the Year 1689''. Library Ireland. Retrieved 24 May 2012.</ref>\n\nEnniskillen and Derry were the two garrisons in Ulster that were not wholly loyal to James II, and it was the last town to fall before the siege of Derry. As a direct result of this conflict, Enniskillen developed not only as a market town but also as a garrison, which became home to two regiments.\n\nThe current site of Fermanagh College (now part of the South West College) was the former Enniskillen Gaol.  Many people were tried and hanged in the square during the times of public execution. Part of the old Gaol is still used by the college.\n\n=== Military history ===\n[[File:Enniskillen Castle by Paride.JPG|thumb|[[Enniskillen Castle]]]]\nEnniskillen is the site of the foundation of two [[British Army]] regiments:\n* [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]\n* [[The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons)]]\n\nThe town's name (with the archaic spelling) continues to form part of the title to [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]. [[Enniskillen Castle]] features on the cap badge of both regiments.\n\n=== The Troubles ===\n{{main|The Troubles in Enniskillen}}\n\nEnniskillen was the site of several events during [[The Troubles]], the most notable being the [[Remembrance Day bombing]] in which 11 people were killed. [[Bill Clinton]] opened the Clinton centre in 2002 on the site of the bombing. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n\n* [[The Enniskillen Dragoon]] is a famous Irish folk song associated with the [[Inniskilling Dragoons|Inniskilling Dragoons Regiment]]. [[Tommy Makem]] wrote additional verses and re-named the song [[Fare Thee Well, Enniskillen]]. \n\n* [[The Chieftains]] sing a song that mentions Enniskillen titled \"North Amerikay\".\n\n* [[Jim Kerr]] of [[Simple Minds]] was so moved by the horror of the [[Enniskillen bombing]] in 1987 that he wrote new words to the traditional folk song \"[[She Moved Through The Fair]]\" and the group recorded it with the name \"[[Belfast Child]]\". The recording reached No. 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]], Ireland and several other countries in 1989. The single was taken from the album ''[[Street Fighting Years]]''; the single version was also published with the title \"Ballad of the Streets\". The video to the song was shot in black and white and displays poignant footage of children and the destruction of the bombing.  Similarly, [[U2]] held a concert the same day of the bombing, which was being filmed for a movie.\n\n* During a performance of their song \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\", singer [[Bono]] passionately condemned the bombing, stating \"fuck the revolution\" in his mid-song speech. The footage is included in U2's [[rockumentary]] ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.<ref name=\"RH\">{{cite video|people=U2, Phil Joanou (director)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096328|title=U2: Rattle and Hum|medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n* [[Neil Hannon]] also mentions Enniskillen in his song [[Sunrise (Divine Comedy song)|Sunrise]]. \n\n* The [[Irish language]] novel ''Mo Dh\u00e1 Mhic\u00ed'' by S\u00e9amus Mac Annaidh is set in Enniskillen.\n\n[[File:Enniskillen Registry Office - geograph.org.uk - 485072.jpg|thumb|Enniskillen Registry Office]]\n\n== Demography ==\nEnniskillen is classified as a medium town (i.e. with population between 10,000 and 18,000 people) by the [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] (NISRA).<ref name=\"NISRA2005SCDS\">{{cite web |work= NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) |title= Statistical Classification and Delineation of Settlements |at= Table 3 / Band C - Large Town |url= http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/public/documents/ur_report.pdf |date= February 2005 |format= PDF |accessdate= 26 September 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}}\n\n===2011 Census===\nOn Census day (27 March 2011) there were 13,823 people living in Enniskillen (5,733 households), accounting for 0.76% of the NI total.<ref name=Census2011/> Of these:\n\n* 19.76% were aged under 16 years and 15.59% were aged 65 and over;\n* 51.80% of the usually resident population were female and 48.20% were male;\n* 61.62% belong to or were brought up in the Catholic religion and 33.55% belong to or were brought up in a 'Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)' religion;\n* 35.59% indicated that they had a British national identity, 33.77% had an Irish national identity and 30.35% had a Northern Irish national identity (respondents could indicate more than one national identity);\n* 39 years was the average (median) age of the population;\n* 13.03% had some knowledge of Irish (Gaelic) and 3.65% had some knowledge of Ulster-Scots.\n\n===2001 Census===\nOn census day in 2011, there were 13,823 people living in Enniskillen.<ref name=Census2011/> This was up 1.7% from the 2001 census.\n* 48.2% of the population were male and 51.8% were female\n* 61.6% were from a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] background and 33.6% were from a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] background. 0.9% were from \"other\" and 4% were from \"none\".\n* 1158 residents were born outside the UK and Ireland.\n* 8.4% of residents were described as \"migrants\"\n* 5.2% of people aged 16\u201374 were unemployed.\n\n== Climate ==\nAs throughout Britain and Ireland, Enniskillen experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters.

Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?\"\n\n[[Thomas Love Peacock]] put these creations into the mouth of the phrenologist Mr. Cranium in his 1816 romp ''[[Headlong Hall]]'': ''osteosarchaematosplanchnochondroneuromuelous'' (44 characters) and ''osseocarnisanguineoviscericartilaginonervomedullary'' (51 characters).\n\n[[James Joyce]] made up nine 100-letter words plus one 101-letter word in his novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the most famous of which is Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk. Appearing on the first page, it allegedly represents the symbolic thunderclap associated with the fall of [[Adam and Eve]]. As it appears nowhere else except in reference to this passage, it is generally not accepted as a real word. [[Sylvia Plath]] made mention of it in her semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', when the protagonist was reading ''Finnegans Wake''.\n\n\"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]\", the 34-letter title of a song from the movie ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', does appear in several dictionaries, but only as a [[proper noun]] defined in reference to the song title. The attributed meaning is \"a word that you say when you don't know what to say.\" The idea and invention of the word is credited to songwriters [[Robert and Richard Sherman]].\n\n=== Agglutinative constructions ===\nThe English language permits the legitimate extension of existing words to serve new purposes by the addition of prefixes and suffixes. This is sometimes referred to as [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] construction. This process can create arbitrarily long words: for example, the prefixes ''pseudo'' (false, spurious) and ''anti'' (against, opposed to) can be added as many times as desired. A word like ''[[anti-aircraft]]'' (pertaining to the defense against aircraft) is easily extended to ''anti-anti-aircraft'' (pertaining to counteracting the defense against aircraft, a legitimate concept) and can from there be prefixed with an endless stream of \"anti-\"s, each time creating a new level of counteraction. More familiarly, the addition of numerous \"great\"s to a relative, e.g. great-great-great-grandfather, can produce words of arbitrary length. In [[musical notation]], a 8192nd note may be called a ''[[semihemidemisemihemidemisemihemidemisemiquaver]]''.\n\n''[[Antidisestablishmentarianism (word)|Antidisestablishmentarianism]]'' is the longest common example of a word formed by [[agglutinative]] construction.\n\n=== Technical terms ===\n[[File:Parastratiosphecomyia sphecomyioides Brunetti (lectotype) - ZooKeys-238-001-g002-2.jpeg|thumb|120px|right|''[[Parastratiosphecomyia sphecomyioides|Para{{shy}}stratio{{shy}}sphe{{shy}}com{{shy}}yia sphe{{shy}}com{{shy}}yioi{{shy}}des]]'']]\nA number of scientific naming schemes can be used to generate arbitrarily long words.\n\nThe [[IUPAC]] nomenclature for organic chemical compounds is open-ended, giving rise to the 189,819-letter chemical name ''Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine'' for the protein also known as [[titin]], which is involved in striated muscle formation. In nature, DNA molecules can be much bigger than protein molecules and therefore potentially be referred to with much longer chemical names. For example, the wheat chromosome 3B contains almost 1 billion base pairs,<ref>Paux et al. (2008) Science, Vol. 322 (5898) 101-104.

To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet [[Euro convergence criteria|strict criteria]], such as a budget [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] of less than 3% of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and [[interest]] rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which resulted in the introduction of the euro. (For [[macroeconomic]] theory, see [[#Optimal currency area|below]].)\n\nThe name \"euro\" was officially adopted in [[Madrid]] on 16 December 1995.<ref name=\"madrid1995\"/> Belgian [[Esperantist]] [[Germain Pirlot]], a former teacher of French and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jacques Santer]], suggesting the name \"euro\" on 4 August 1995.<ref>{{Cite news | title= Germain Pirlot 'uitvinder' van de euro | url= http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | publisher= De Zeewacht | language= Dutch | date= 16 February 2007 | accessdate= 21 May 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130630181850/http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | archivedate= 30 June 2013 | df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDue to differences in national conventions for [[rounding]] and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of [[Triangulation (finance)|triangulation]] via the euro. The ''definitive'' values of one euro in terms of the [[exchange rate]]s at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right.\n\nThe rates were determined by the [[Council of the European Union]],<ref group=\"note\">by means of Council Regulation 2866/98 (EC) of 31 December 1998.</ref> based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the [[pound sterling]]) that day.\n\nThe procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the [[Greek drachma]] and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand.<ref group=\"note\">by Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC) of 19 June 2000</ref>\n\nThe currency was introduced in non-physical form ([[traveller's cheque]]s, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as [[legal tender]] until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.\n\nThe changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the [[Deutsche Mark|mark]] officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese [[Portuguese escudo|escudos]], which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.{{clear}}\n\n===Eurozone crisis===\n{{main|Eurozone crisis|Greek government-debt crisis}}\n{{see also|2008\u201311 Icelandic financial crisis}}\n\n[[File:Government surplus or deficit (EU-USA-UK).png|thumb|Budget deficit of the eurozone compared to the United States and the UK.]]\n\nFollowing the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, fears of a [[Sovereign default|sovereign debt crisis]] developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in [[2000s European sovereign debt crisis timeline|early 2010]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> [[Economy of Greece|Greece]] was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members [[Economy of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Economy of Italy|Italy]], [[Economy of Portugal|Portugal]], and [[Economy of Spain|Spain]] were also significantly affected.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/world/europe/european-debt-crisis-fast-facts/index.html European Debt Crisis Fast Facts], CNN Library (last updated 22 January 2017).</ref><ref>[[Ricardo Reis]], [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PDFReisTextFallBPEA.pdf Looking for a Success in the Euro Crisis Adjustment Programs: The Case of Portugal], ''Brookings Papers on Economic Activity'', [[Brookings Institution]] (Fall 2015), p. 433.</ref> All these countries utilized EU funds except Italy, which is a major donor to the EFSF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkiesta.it/it/article/2011/11/04/efsf-come-funziona-il-fondo-salvastati-europeo/2302/|title=Efsf, come funziona il fondo salvastati europeo|date=4 November 2011|publisher=}}</ref> To be included in the eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]], but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3454 |title=The politics of the Maastricht convergence criteria|publisher=Voxeu.org |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] in 2011, \"[I]f the [euro area] is treated as a single entity, its [economic and fiscal] position looks no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK\" and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the United States. \"Moreover\", they write, \"private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] economies\".

There are two models, both proposed by [[Robert Mundell]]: the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with stationary expectations|stationary expectations model]] and the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with international risk sharing|international risk sharing model]]. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro.<ref>A Plan for a European Currency, 1973 by Mundell</ref> However, even before the creation of the single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the [[late-2000s recession]] it was considered unlikely that a state would leave the euro or the whole zone would collapse.<ref>{{cite paper |ssrn=1014341 |title=The Breakup of the Euro Area by Barry Eichengreen |date=14 September 2007 |id=NBER Working Paper No. w13393}}</ref> However the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] led to former [[British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13839381 |title=Greek debt crisis: Straw says eurozone 'will collapse' |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', explains it: {{cquote|The guiding principle of the currency, which opened for business in 1999, were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country's annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product, and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of G.D.P. It was a nice idea, but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone, Germany and France, had broken the rules for three years in a row.<ref>John Lanchester, \"Euro Science,\" ''New Yorker'', 10 October 2011.</ref>}}\n\n===Transaction costs and risks===\n\n{{Most traded currencies|group=\"note\"}}\n\nThe most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., [[credit card]]s, [[debit card]]s and [[cash machine]] withdrawals).\n\nFinancial markets on the continent are expected to be far more [[market liquidity|liquid]] and flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that [[risk aversion]] has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.<ref>Benchimol, J., 2014. [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/reecon/v68y2014i1p39-56.html Risk aversion in the Eurozone], [[Research in Economics]], vol. 68, issue 1, pp. 39\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Price parity===\n\nAnother effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices\u2014in particular in price levels\u2014should decrease because of the [[law of one price]]. Differences in prices can trigger [[arbitrage]], i.e., [[speculation|speculative]] trade in a [[commodity]] across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Pinelopi K. |last=Goldberg |first2=Frank |last2=Verboven |title=Market Integration and Convergence to the Law of One Price: Evidence from the European Car Market |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=65 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=49\u201373 |doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2003.12.002 }}</ref>\n\n===Macroeconomic stability===\n\nBefore the introduction of the euro, some countries had successfully contained inflation, which was then seen as a major economic problem, by establishing largely independent central banks. One such bank was the [[Bundesbank]] in Germany; the European Central Bank was modelled on the Bundesbank.<ref name=\"bundesbank\">{{Cite book|title=The History of the Bundesbank: Lessons for the European Central Bank |last=de Haan |first=Jakob |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-21723-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EaIV0OWlaokC}}</ref>\n\nThe euro has come under criticism due to its imperialistic style regulation, lack of flexibility and <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Steven J|year=2004|title=Is the Euro Working?

While increased liquidity may lower the [[nominal interest rate]] on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.\n\nUnfortunately, there is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult.\n\nIn general, those in Europe who own large amounts of euros are served by high stability and low inflation.\n\n====Trade====\nA 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.de/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp594.pdf |title=The euro's trade effects |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> although one study suggested an increase of only 3%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |title=The Euro Effect on Trade is not as Large as Commonly Thought |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724172326/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> while another estimated 9 to 14%.<ref>{{cite journal |ssrn=1079383 |title=SSRN-Estimating the Euro Effects on Trade with Propensity Score Matching by Pandej Chintrakarn |journal=Review of International Economics |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=186\u2013198 |date=February 2008}}</ref> However, a [[meta-analysis]] of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by [[publication bias]] and that the underlying effect may be negligible.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/670658078011l5r1/ |title=Rose effect and the euro: is the magic gone? |work=Review of World Economics |accessdate=13 July 2010 |doi=10.1007/s10290-010-0050-1 |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=241\u2013261|year=2010 |last1=Havr\u00e1nek |first1=Tom\u00e1\u0161 }}</ref> Furthermore, studies accounting for [[Time trend analysis|time trend]] reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gomes|first1=Tamara|last2=Graham|first2=Chris|last3=Helliwel|first3=John|last4=Takashi|first4=Kano|last5=Murray|first5=John|last6=Schembri|first6=Lawrence|title=The Euro and Trade: Is there a Positive Effect?|url=http://www2.dse.unibo.it/soegw/paper/GomGraHelKanoMurrayS.pdf|publisher=Bank of Canada|date=August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903222409/http://www2.dse.unibo.it/soegw/paper/GomGraHelKanoMurrayS.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=H.|first1=Berger|last2=V.|first2=Nitsch|title=Zooming out: The trade effect of the euro in historical perspective|journal=Journal of International Money and Finance|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1244\u20131260|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026156060800096X|doi=10.1016/j.jimonfin.2008.07.005|year=2008}}</ref> These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.\n\n====Investment====\nPhysical investment seems to have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |title=The Impact of the Euro on Investment: Sectoral Evidence |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831043539/http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |archivedate=31 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Regarding foreign direct investment, a study found that the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5njSL0hxe?url=http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2010 |title=Does the single currency affect FDI? |publisher=AFSE.fr |format=PDF |accessdate=30 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe.

This is because of the implications of the [[Mundell\u2013Fleming model]], which implies a central bank cannot (without [[capital control]]s) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the [[money supply]] results in a [[depreciation]] of the currency. In the years following the [[Single European Act]], the EU has liberalised its capital markets and, as the ECB has [[inflation targeting]] as its [[monetary policy]], the exchange-rate regime of the euro is [[floating exchange rate|floating]].\n\n===Against other major currencies===\n\nThe euro is the second-most widely held [[reserve currency]] after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (3 May vs [[Pound sterling]], 25 October vs the [[U.S. dollar]], 26 October vs [[Japanese yen]]).

[[doi:10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017|DOI]].</ref>) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB's own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. \n* '''Personal independence:''' the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years.<ref name=\"Independence\" /> In addition, ECB board members and are vastly immune from judicial proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp4.pdf?581a2ecf674a6554f5af698f5bf54019|title=PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|last=|first=|date=2007|website=European Central Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Indeed, removals from office can only be decided by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU), under the request of the ECB's Governing Council or the Executive Board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem' national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.\n* '''Financial independence''': the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB's financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct financing to public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.\n\n=== ECB transparency ===\nIn addition to its independence, the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks. Indeed, as pointed out by [[Transparency International]], \"The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions. They do, however, grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles. According to Art. 15(3) TFEU, the ECB is bound by the EU\u2019s transparency principles \u201conly when exercising [its] administrative tasks\u201d (the exemption \u2013 which leaves the term \u201cadministrative tasks\u201d undefined \u2013 equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://transparency.eu/ecb/|title=Transparency International EU - The global coalition against corruption in Brussels|last=EU|first=Transparency International|website=transparency.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05|date=2017-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions:\n* '''Voting secrecy''': while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ECB's Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion. Since 2014 however, the ECB publishes \"accounts\" of its monetary policy meetings,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr140703_1.en.html|title=ECB to adjust schedule of meetings and to publish regular accounts of monetary policy discussions in 2015|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes.\n* '''Access to documents''': The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB. However, under the ECB\u2019s Rules of Procedure the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30-year period.<!-- Art. 23.3 Rules of Procedure.

First, because the ECB's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds (Article 123. TFEU).<ref>Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.</ref> This prevented the ECB from implementing [[quantitative easing]] like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets. Secondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB's open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB [[Athanasios Orphanides]], this change in the ECB's collateral framework \"planted the seed\" of the euro crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/how-ecb-planted-seeds-euro-area-crisis|title=Monetary policy and fiscal discipline: How the ECB planted the seeds of the euro area crisis|last=Orphanides|first=Athanasios|date=2018-03-09|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref>\n\nFaced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets.

Responding to this threat, the ECB announced on 4 September 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes: the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme (CBPP3) and Asset-Backed Securities Programme (ABSPP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140904.en.html|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)|last=European Central Bank|first=|date=|website=European Central Bank|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> \n\nOn 22 January 2015, the ECB announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge \"quantitative easing\" programme which also included sovereign bonds, to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least September 2016. The programme was started on 9 March 2015. The program was repeatedly extended to reach about \u20ac2,500 billons and is currently expected to last until at least end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Draghi fends off German critics and keeps stimulus untouched|url = https://www.ft.com/content/efece562-2b30-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Monetary policy tools===\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements.<ref name=\"Euro debt crisis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-all-about-european-debt-crisis-in-simple-terms/20110819.htm |title=All about the European debt crisis: In SIMPLE terms|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=rediff business|publisher=rediff.com}}</ref> These tools are also used by the United States [[Federal Reserve Bank]], but the Fed does more direct purchasing of financial assets than its European counterpart.<ref name=\"US Open Market operations\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operation&nbsp;\u2013 Fedpoints&nbsp;\u2013 Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=newyorkfed.org | work=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | date=August 2011 | accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref> The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.<ref name=\"Euro debt crisis\" />\n\nThe criteria for determining \"high quality\" for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large.<ref name=\"Euro debt working paper\">{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/304/1/wp_2011_1_darvas.pdf |title=WOrking paper 2011 / 1 A Comprehensive approach to the EUro-area debt crisis|date=February 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=Zsolt Darvas|publisher=Corvinus University of Budapest |format=PDF}}</ref> Though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency\u2014or the lack of same.<ref name=\"Euro debt working paper\" />\n\nIn [[central banking]], the privileged status of the central bank is that it can make as much money as it deems needed.<ref name=\"Bernanke\" /> In the [[Federal Reserve Bank|United States Federal Reserve Bank]], the Federal Reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the Federal government.<ref name=\"Bernanke\" /> There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as [[commercial paper]].<ref name=\"Bernanke\" /> The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for functioning of the financial system.<ref name=\"Bernanke\">{{cite web|title=Federal Reserve Policies in the Financial Crisis|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Ben S.

In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of financial institutions, to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by two non-European private agencies: Moody's and S&P.\n\n====Difference with US Federal Reserve====\nIn the United States, the [[Federal Reserve System]] purchases Treasury securities in order to inject liquidity into the economy. The [[Eurosystem]], on the other hand, uses a different method. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.<ref>In practice, 400\u2013500 banks participate regularly. <br />{{citation|author=Samuel Cheun|title=The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil|date=December 2009|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf|publisher=ECB|accessdate=24 August 2011|author2=Isabel von K\u00f6ppen-Mertes|author3=Benedict Weller}}</ref>\n\nThe banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating \"net borrowed\" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}\n\nTo qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities.

The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like [[neutron]]s and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer [[de Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.\n\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[chemistry]] and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitational wave|gravitation]]al, [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].<ref name=\"anastopoulos1\" /> Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, it will generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\nInteractions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.<ref name=Pauling/> In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.<ref name=\"arabatzis\"/> Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and [[J.

Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other [[charge (physics)|charges]] of the opposite sign.

The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} \u2212''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>)}}, where the variables ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. [[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.<ref name=\"munowitz\"/>{{rp|162\u2013218}}\n\nIn the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a [[zero probability]] that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.<ref name=\"munowitz\"/>{{rp|162\u2013218}}\n\n===Virtual particles===\n{{Main article|Virtual particle}}\nIn a simplified picture, every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly [[Annihilation|annihilate]] each other shortly thereafter.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last = Kane | first = G.\n | date = October 9, 2006\n | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=are-virtual-particles-rea&topicID=13\n | title = Are virtual particles really constantly popping in and out of existence?

It was isolated in 1901 and is named after the continent of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Periodic Table: Europium |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry }}</ref> It is a moderately hard, silvery [[metal]] which readily oxidizes in air and [[water]]. Being a typical member of the [[lanthanide]] series, europium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly [[redox|reducing]]. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium is one of the least abundant elements in the universe; only about {{val|5|e=-8}}% of all matter in the universe is europium.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical properties===\n[[File:Eu-Block.jpg|thumb|left|About 300 g of dendritic sublimated 99.998% pure europium handled in a glove box]]\n[[File:Europium on air oxidized.jpg|thumb|left|Oxidized europium, coated with yellow europium(II) carbonate]]\nEuropium is a [[ductile]] metal with a hardness similar to that of [[lead]].

In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the \"negative [[europium anomaly]]\", the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the [[chondrite|chondritic]] abundance. Bastn\u00e4site tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today.

Separation of the rare-earth elements is a step in the later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals [[bastn\u00e4site]], [[loparite-(Ce)]], [[xenotime]], and [[monazite]] in mineable quantities. Bastn\u00e4site is a group of related fluorocarbonates, Ln(CO<sub>3</sub>)(F,OH). Monazite is a group of related of orthophosphate minerals {{chem|Ln|P|O|4}} (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except [[promethium]]), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is an orthophosphate (Y,Yb,Er,...)PO<sub>4</sub>. Monazite also contains [[thorium]] and [[yttrium]], which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by [[solvent extraction]]s or [[ion exchange chromatography]] yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of [[alkaline earth metal]]s and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate.<ref name=\"GuptaL\">{{cite journal| pages = 197\u2013248|url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/imr/1992/00000037/00000001/art00015|title =Extractive metallurgy of rare earths|journal = International Materials Reviews|date = 1992|volume = 37|first1 = C.

In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is about two-thirds of the total by weight, and erbia is about 4\u20135%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.\n\n==Production==\nCrushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or [[sulfuric acid]] that transforms insoluble rare-earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) to pH 3\u20134. [[Thorium]] precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths into their insoluble [[oxalate]]s. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in [[nitric acid]] that excludes one of the main components, [[cerium]], whose oxide is insoluble in HNO<sub>3</sub>. The solution is treated with [[magnesium nitrate]] to produce a crystallized mixture of [[double salt]]s of rare-earth metals. The salts are separated by [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent.<ref name=patnaik/> Erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with [[calcium]] at {{val|1450|u=\u00b0C}} under argon atmosphere.<ref name=patnaik/>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Erbium-glass.jpg|thumb|Erbium-colored glass]]\nErbium's everyday uses are varied.

A member of the [[actinide]] series, it is the seventh [[transuranic element]].\n\nEinsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the [[Ivy Mike|first hydrogen bomb]] explosion in 1952, and named after [[Albert Einstein]]. Its most common [[isotope]] einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of [[californium]]-253 in a few dedicated high-power [[nuclear reactor]]s with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element [[mendelevium]] in 1955.\n\nEinsteinium is a soft, silvery, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]]. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 [[oxidation state]]; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 [[watt]]s per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to [[berkelium]]-249 and then [[californium]]-249 at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk.<ref>[http://periodic.lanl.gov/99.shtml Einsteinium]. periodic.lanl.gov</ref> Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.<ref name=h1579/>\n\nLike all synthetic [[transuranic element]]s, isotopes of einsteinium are very [[radioactivity|radioactive]] and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.<ref name=CRC/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|left|Einsteinium was first observed in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]\nEinsteinium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first identified]] in December 1952 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] and co-workers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in collaboration with the [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] National Laboratories, in the fallout from the ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' nuclear test.

One of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the [[neutron flux]], and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man-made neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10<sup>23</sup> neutrons/cm<sup>2</sup> within a microsecond, or about 10<sup>29</sup> neutrons/(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5{{e|15}} neutrons/(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at [[Enewetak Atoll]] for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.<ref name=s39/>\n\nThe atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and [[thorium]] have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300\u2013600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.<ref name=s39/><ref name=s40>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 40</ref>\n\nAmong the nine underground tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969,<ref>These were codenamed: \"Anacostia\" (5.2 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], 1962), \"Kennebec\" (<5 kilotons, 1963), \"Par\" (38 kilotons, 1964), \"Barbel\" (<20 kilotons, 1964), \"Tweed\" (<20 kilotons, 1965), \"Cyclamen\" (13 kilotons, 1966), \"Kankakee\" (20-200 kilotons, 1966), \"Vulcan\" (25 kilotons, 1966) and \"Hutch\" (20-200 kilotons, 1969)</ref><ref>[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615000000/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }}, DOE/NV--209-REV 15, December 2000.</ref> the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond.<ref name=s40/> However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4{{e|-14}} of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1{{e|-7}} of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.<ref name=s43>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 43</ref> Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.<ref name=s44>[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 44</ref>\n\nAlthough no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.<!-- About 6{{e|9}} atoms of <sup>257</sup>Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation.

In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low.<ref name=h1583>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1583</ref> The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, <sup>253</sup>Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to <sup>249</sup>Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.<ref name=h1584>[[#Haire|Haire]], pp. 1584\u20131585</ref>\n\nSeparation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products can be done by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) as [[eluant]]. It is usually followed by [[anion-exchange chromatography]] using 6 [[molar concentration|molar]] HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using \u03b1-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (\u03b1-HIB), for example, as eluant.<ref name=book2>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&pg=PA11|pages=9\u201311|title=The new chemistry|author=Hall, Nina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|isbn=0-521-45224-4}}</ref>\n\nSeparation of the 3+ actinides can also be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.<ref name=book2/>\n\n===Preparation of the metal===\nEinsteinium is highly reactive and therefore strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds.<ref name=h1588>[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1588</ref> This can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium(III) fluoride with metallic [[lithium]]:\n:EsF<sub>3</sub> + 3 Li \u2192 Es + 3 LiF\n\nHowever, owing to its low melting point and high rate of self-radiation damage, einsteinium has high vapor pressure, which is higher than that of lithium fluoride.

Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium [[citrate]] (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs.<ref name=h1579/> Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone [[Chelation|chelate]] complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited [[luminescence]] among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es<sup>3+</sup> ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd<sup>3+</sup> ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es<sup>3+</sup> was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es<sup>3+</sup> ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nugent|first1=Leonard J.|last2=Burnett|first2=J. L.|last3=Baybarz|first3=R.

The luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below 0.1%.

At that time, Merkel had generally been seen as a transitional chair and was strongly opposed by the CDU's male leaders, often called the party's \"crown princes\".\n\nIn the run up to the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 national elections]], the CSU/CDU held a huge lead in the opinion polls and Stoiber famously remarked that \"...this election is like a [[association football|football]] match where it's the second half and my team is ahead by 2\u20130.\" However, on election day things had changed. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] had mounted a huge comeback, and the CDU/CSU was narrowly defeated (though both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, the SPD was ahead by a small 6,000 vote margin, winning 251 seats to the CDU/CSU's 248). The election was one of modern Germany's closest votes.<ref>Jess Smee (January 17, 2007), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/19/germany.mainsection Stoiber quits after snooping row] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n\n[[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] was re-elected as chancellor by the parliament in a coalition with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], who had increased their vote share marginally. Many commentators faulted Stoiber's reaction to the [[2002 European floods|floods]] in eastern Germany, in the run-up to the election, as a contributory factor in his party's poor electoral result and defeat. In addition, Schr\u00f6der distinguished himself from his opponent by taking an active stance against the upcoming United States-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]]. His extensive campaigning on this stance was widely seen as swinging the election to the SPD in the weeks running up to the election.\n\n===Later political career===\nStoiber subsequently led the CSU to an absolute majority in the [[Bavarian state election, 2003|2003 Bavarian state elections]], for the third time in a row, winning this time 60,7% of the votes and a two-thirds majority in the Landtag.

He was slated to join Merkel's first grand coalition cabinet as [[Federal Minister for Economics and Labour (Germany)|Economics minister]]. However, on 1 November 2005, he announced his decision to stay in Bavaria, due to personnel changes on the SPD side of the coalition ([[Franz M\u00fcntefering]] resigned as SPD chairman) and an unsatisfactory apportionment of competences between himself and designated Science minister [[Annette Schavan]]. Stoiber also resigned his seat in the 16th Bundestag, being a member from 18 October to 8 November.\n\nSubsequently, criticism grew in the CSU, where other politicians had to scale back their ambitions after Stoiber's decision to stay in Bavaria. On 18 January 2007, he announced his decision to stand down from the posts of minister-president and party chairman by 30 September. [[G\u00fcnther Beckstein]], then Bavarian state minister of the interior, succeeded him as minister-president and [[Erwin Huber]] as party chairman, defeating [[Horst Seehofer]] at a convention at 18 September 2007 with 58,1% of the votes.

During his election campaign, he made clear his opposition to war, and his support for the introduction of weapons inspectors to Iraq without preconditions as a way of avoiding war, and he criticized Schr\u00f6der for harming the German-American alliance by not calling [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and discussing the issue privately.<ref>Steven Erlanger (September 9, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/international/europe/09BERL.html Stance on Bush Policy Could Swing Election in Germany] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> He also attacked German Foreign Minister [[Joschka Fischer]] for his criticism of the U.S. position.<ref>William Boston (February 26, 2002), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1014666184388287560 As Stoiber Looks Past Economy, His Campaign Hits Shaky Ground] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>\n\nStoiber is known for backing [[Vladimir Putin]] and there have been comparisons to [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. One author called Stoiber a \"Moscow's Trojan Horse\".<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32853 From Schr\u00f6der to Stoiber?] Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 4 Issue: 132</ref><ref>[http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=354 Edmund Stoiber \u2013 Moscow's Trojan Horse in the Opposition Camp]</ref><ref>[http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?q=6122.4530.0.0 The German Election Campaign Has Commenced].

Ron Fraser. The Trumpet. 2008</ref>\n\n===European integration===\nStoiber has been said to be skeptical of Germany's decision to adopt the [[euro]]. When the [[European Commission]] recommended that [[Greece]] be allowed to join the [[eurozone]] in 1998, he demanded that the country be barred from adopting the common currency for several years instead.<ref>Edmund L. Andrews (May 8, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/08/world/falling-euro-a-unity-currency-instead-bolsters-dollar-and-pound.html Falling Euro, a Unity Currency, Instead Bolsters Dollar and Pound] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> He is a staunch opponent of [[Turkey]]'s integration into the [[European Union]], claiming that its non-Christian culture would dilute the Union.\n \nAt the same time, Stoiber has repeatedly insisted he is a \"good European\" who is keen, for instance, on forging an EU-wide foreign policy, replete with a single European army.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/28574 Edmund Stoiber, torch-bearer for Germany\u2019s right] ''[[The Economist]]'', August 3, 2000.</ref> Earlier, in 1993, he had told German newspapers: \"I want a simple confederation. That means the nation-states maintain their dominant role, at least as far as internal matters are concerned.\"<ref>Craig R. Whitney (November 12, 1993), [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/world/kohl-defends-european-unity-to-doubters.html Kohl Defends European Unity to Doubters] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nWhile the conservative wing of the German political spectrum, primarily formed of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], enjoys considerable support, this support tends to be less extended to Stoiber. He enjoys considerably more support in his home state of Bavaria than in the rest of Germany, where CDU chairwoman [[Angela Merkel]] is more popular. This has its reasons: Merkel supports a kind of [[fiscal conservatism]], but a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[social policy]]. Stoiber, on the other hand, favors a more conservative approach to both fiscal and social matters, and while this ensures him the religious vote, strongest in Bavaria, it has weakened his support at the national level.\n\nIn 2005, Stoiber successfully lobbied [[Novartis]], the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, to move the headquarters of its [[Sandoz]] subsidiary to Munich, making it one of Europe's highest-profile corporate relocations that year as well as a significant boost to Stoiber's attempts to build up Bavaria as a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology center.<ref>Haig Simonian and Ralph Atkins (April 26, 2005), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/54458816-b5f0-11d9-be59-00000e2511c8.html Sandoz to move HQ to Munich] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring his time as Minister-President of Bavaria, Stoiber pushed for the construction of a roughly 40-kilometer high-speed [[Maglev|magnetic-levitation]] link from Munich's main station to its airport, to be built by [[Transrapid|Transrapid International]], a consortium including [[ThyssenKrupp]] and Munich-based [[Siemens]]. After he left office, the German federal government abandoned the plans in 2008 because of spiraling costs of as much as \u20ac3.4 billion.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/business/worldbusiness/27iht-27maglev.11473863.html Germany cancels magnetic-levitation train line] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', March 27, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Domestic policy===\nStoiber, as a minister in the state of Bavaria, was widely known for advocating a reduction in the number of [[asylum seekers]] Germany accepts, something that prompted critics to label him [[xenophobic]], anti-Turkish and anti-Islam. In the late 1990s he criticized the incoming Chancellor Schr\u00f6der for saying that he would work hard in the interest of Germans ''and'' people living in Germany. Stoiber's remarks drew heavy criticism in the press.\n\nWhen Germany's [[Federal Constitutional Court]] decided in 1995 that a Bavarian law requiring a [[crucifix]] to be hung in each of the state's 40,000 classrooms was unconstitutional, Stoiber said he would not order the removal of crucifixes \"for the time being,\" and asserted that he was under no obligation to remove them in schools where parents unanimously opposed such action.<ref>Stephen Kinzer (August 23, 1995), [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/23/world/crucifix-ruling-angers-bavarians.html Crucifix Ruling Angers Bavarians] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring his 2002 election campaign, Stoiber indicated he would not ban same-sex marriages \u2013 sanctioned by the Schr\u00f6der government \u2013 a policy he had vehemently objected to when it was introduced.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2045754.stm Edmund Stoiber: Bringing Bavaria to Berlin] ''[[BBC News]]'', June 17, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Media policy===\nStoiber has been a staunch advocate of changes in German law that would give more power to owners of private TV channels. In 1995, he publicy called for the abolition of Germany's public television service [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and a streamlining of its regional services, adding that he and Minister-President [[Kurt Biedenkopf]] of [[Saxony]] would break the contract ARD has with regional governments if reforms were not undertaken.<ref>Michael Kallenbach (April 3, 1995), [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/news/03iht-hh_0.html Public and Private Television at the Crossroads] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> However, when [[European Commissioner for Competition]] [[Karel van Miert]] unveiled ideas for reforming the rules governing the financing of public service broadcasters in 1998, Stoiber led the way in rejecting moves to reform established practice.<ref>Peter Chapman (October 14, 1998), [http://www.politico.eu/article/poor-reception-for-tv-funding-policy/ Poor reception for TV funding policy] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Comments on East Germany===\nDuring the run-up to the German [[German federal election, 2005|general election]] in 2005, which was held ahead of schedule, Stoiber created controversy through a campaign speech held in the beginning of August 2005 in the federal state of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. He  said, \"I do not accept that the East [of Germany] will again decide who will be Germany's chancellor. It cannot be allowed that the frustrated determine Germany's fate.\" People in the new federal states of Germany (the former [[German Democratic Republic]]) were offended by Stoiber's remarks. While the CSU attempted to portray them as \"misinterpreted\", Stoiber created further controversy when he claimed that \"if it was like Bavaria everywhere, there wouldn't be any problems. Unfortunately, not everyone in Germany is as intelligent as in Bavaria.\" The tone of the comments was exacerbated by a perception by some within Germany of the state of Bavaria as \"arrogant\".\n\nMany, including members of the CDU, attribute Stoiber's comments and behavior as a contributing factor to the CDU's losses in the 2005 general election. He was accused by many in the CDU/CSU of offering \"half-hearted\" support to Angela Merkel, with some even accusing him of being reluctant to support a female candidate from the East. (This also contrasted unfavorably with Merkel's robust support for his candidacy in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]].) He has insinuated that votes were lost because of the choice of a female candidate. He came under heavy fire for these comments from press and politicians alike, especially since he himself lost almost 10% of the Bavarian vote \u2013 a dubious feat in itself as Bavarians tend to consistently vote conservatively. Nonetheless, a poll has suggested over 9% may have voted differently if the conservative candidate was a man from the West, although this does not clearly show if such a candidate would have gained or lost votes for the conservatives.\n\n===BayernLB activities===\nWhen the [[Croatian National Bank]] turned down [[BayernLB]]'s original bid to take over the local arm of [[Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International]], this drew strong criticism from Stoiber, who said the decision was \"unacceptable\" and a \"severe strain\" for Bavaria's relations with [[Croatia]]. Croatia was seeking to join the [[European Union]] at the time. The central bank\u2019s board later reviewed and accepted BayernLB's offer of 1.6 billion euros.<ref>Zoran Radosavljevic (September 12, 2007), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1281484820070912 BLB gets nod from Croatia to take over Hypo unit] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> The investment in Hypo Group Alpe Adria was part of a series of ill-fated investments, which later forced BayernLB to take a 10 billion-euro bailout in the financial crisis.\n\n===European Commission job===\nIn September 2015, [[Emily O'Reilly]], the [[European Ombudsman]], received a complaint from two NGOs, [[Corporate Europe Observatory]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], according to which Stoiber\u2019s appointment as special adviser on the Commission\u2019s better regulation agenda broke internal rules on appointments.<ref>Quentin Ari\u00e8s (March 30, 2016), [http://www.politico.eu/article/commissioners-request-outside-help-from-big-hitters/ Commissioners request outside help from big hitters] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nStoiber is [[Roman Catholic]]. He is married to [[Karin Stoiber]]. They have three children: Constanze (1971), Veronica (1977), Dominic (1980) and five grandchildren: Johannes (1999), Benedikt (2001), Theresa Marie (2005), Ferdinand (2009) and another grandson (2011).\n\nStoiber is a keen [[association football|football]] fan and he serves as Co-Chairman on the Advisory Board of [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Before the 2002 election FC Bayern General Manager [[Uli Hoene\u00df]] expressed his support for Stoiber and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]. Football legend, former FC Bayern President and [[German Football Association|DFB]] Vice-President, [[Franz Beckenbauer]], on the other hand, showed his support for Stoiber by letting him join the [[German national football team]] on their flight home from [[Japan]] after the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn his youth, he played for local football side [[BCF Wolfratshausen]].<ref name=logo>[http://www.bcf-wolfratshausen.de/Fussball/Entstehungsgeschichte.html Das Logo zeigt den Ursprung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102204305/http://www.bcf-wolfratshausen.de/Fussball/Entstehungsgeschichte.html |date=2009-01-02 }} {{de icon}} BCF website \u2013 Club history, accessed: 27 June 2009</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n[[File:Edmund Stoiber.jpg|thumb|Edmund Stoiber during the conferment Order against the deadly seriousness, March 2000]]\n* 1984: [[Bavarian Order of Merit]]\n* 1996: {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl-Valentin-Orden|de}}\n* 1996: [[Grand Order of King Dmitar Zvonimir]]\n* 1999: [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]]\n* 2000: {{Interlanguage link multi|Order against the deadly seriousness|de|3=Orden wider den tierischen Ernst}}\n* 2002: Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]]\n* 2003: Officer of the [[Ordre national du Qu\u00e9bec]]\n* 2004: Grand Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n* 2005: [[Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria|''Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash'' for Services to the Republic of Austria]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question about the Decoration of Honour | language = German | page=1366  |trans-title=| format = pdf | accessdate = November 2012 }}</ref>\n* 2006: Grand Cross of [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]\n* 2007: Large Gold Medal of the province of Upper Austria\n* 2007: Honorary degree awarded by the [[Sogang University]]<ref>http://www.abendblatt.de/politik/ausland/article458330/Edmund-Stoiber-ist-jetzt-Ehrendoktor-in-Suedkorea.html</ref>\n* 2008: [[Steiger Award]]\n* 2009: [[Order of Merit of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n\n==Literature==\n* Michael Stiller: ''Edmund Stoiber: der Kandidat.''

Retrieved 31 October 2016</ref> The city's economy is based on agriculture, horticulture and microelectronics. Its central location has led to it becoming a logistics hub for Germany and central Europe. Erfurt hosts the second-largest trade fair in eastern Germany (after Leipzig) as well as the public television children\u2019s channel [[KiKa]].\n\nThe city is situated on the [[Via Regia]], a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network. Modern day Erfurt is also a hub for [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] high speed trains and other German and European transport networks. Erfurt was first mentioned in 742, as [[Saint Boniface]] founded the diocese. Although the town did not belong to any of the Thuringian states politically, it quickly became the economic centre of the region. It was part of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] during the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and later became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1802. From 1949 until 1990 Erfurt was part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).\n\nThe [[University of Erfurt]] was founded in 1379,<ref name=\"uni-erfurt.de\">[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/portrait/history-and-buildings/timeline/ Timeline<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> making it the first university to be established within the geographic area which constitutes modern-day Germany. It closed in 1816 and was re-established in 1994, with the main modern campus on what was a teachers' training college. [[Martin Luther]] (1483 - 1546) was the most famous student of the institution, studying there from 1501.<ref name=\"uni-erfurt.de\"/> Other noted Erfurters include the medieval philosopher and mystic [[Meister Eckhart]] (c. 1260-1328), the Baroque composer [[Johann Pachelbel]] (1653-1706) and the sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920).\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Erfurt}}\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\nErfurt is an old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic settlement]].

Together with the other five Thuringian [[woad]] towns of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], [[Bad Tennstedt|Tennstedt]], [[Arnstadt]] and [[Bad Langensalza|Langensalza]] it was the centre of the German woad trade, which made those cities very wealthy. Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the [[Via Regia]] was one of the most used east\u2013west roads between France and Russia (via [[Frankfurt]], Erfurt, [[Leipzig]] and [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) and another route in the north\u2013south direction was the connection between the [[Baltic Sea]] ports (e. g. [[L\u00fcbeck]]) and the potent upper Italian city-states like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Milan]].\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries both the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and the [[Electorate of Mainz]] held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual \"{{lang|de|Freizins}}\" (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today's {{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}}). After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town ([[S\u00f6mmerda]]). Erfurt became an important regional power between the [[Landgraviate of Thuringia]] around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the [[Electorate of Saxony]] to the east. Between 1306 and 1481, Erfurt was allied with the two other major Thuringian cities ([[M\u00fchlhausen]] and [[Nordhausen]]) in the Thuringian City Alliance and the three cities joined the [[Hanseatic League]] together in 1430. A peak in economic development was reached in the 15th century, when the city had a population of 20,000 making it one of the largest in Germany. Between 1432 and 1446, a second and higher city wall was established. In 1483, a first city fortress was built on [[Cyriaksburg]] hill in the southwestern part of the town.\n\nThe Jewish community of Erfurt was founded in the 11th century and became, together with [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], one of the most influential in Germany. Their [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]] is still extant and a museum today, as is the [[mikveh]] at Gera river near {{lang|de|Kr\u00e4merbr\u00fccke}}.<ref name=mikveh>Archeologists Discover Medieval Jewish Bath in Erfurt, 12.04.2007, Deutsche Welle, [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2440473,00.html]</ref> In 1349, during the wave of [[Black Death Jewish persecutions]] across Europe, the Jews of Erfurt were rounded up, with [[Erfurt massacre (1349)|more than 100 killed]] and the rest driven from the city.

Some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the \"Latin Quarter\" in the northern city centre (like {{lang|la|Collegium Maius}}, student dorms \"{{lang|de|Georgenburse}}\" and others, the hospital and the church of the university). The university quickly became a hotspot of German cultural life in [[Renaissance humanism]] with scholars like [[Ulrich von Hutten]], [[Helius Eobanus Hessus]] and [[Justus Jonas]].\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n[[File:Erfurt-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|left|Erfurt in 1650]]\n[[File:Luftbild Statthalterei.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|de|[[:de:Kurmainzische Statthalterei|Kurmainzische Statthalterei]]}}'', seat of the governors of Erfurt (at front)]]\n[[File:Erfurt (German States) 1645 10 Ducat (Portugaloser).jpg|thumb|Christina, Queen of Sweden, depicted on a 1645 Erfurt 10 ducat coin. {{refn|group=note|Between 1631 and 1648, during the Thirty Years\u2019 War, Erfurt was occupied by Swedish forces,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXSrLbIEDBMC|location=|pages=490\u2013491|title= Standard Catalog of World Gold Coins  1601 \u2013 present|edition=6|ref=harv|publisher=Krause|isbn=978-1-4402-0424-1|editor-last=Cuhaj|editor-first=George S.|year=2009a}}</ref> thus the [[effigy]] of Queen Christina appears on the 1645 Erfurt 10 [[Ducat]] (Portugaloser).

After 1505, he lived at [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St. Augustine's Monastery]] as a friar. In 1507 he was ordained as a priest in Erfurt Cathedral. He moved permanently to [[Wittenberg]] in 1511. Erfurt was an early adopter of the [[Protestant Reformation]], in 1521.<ref>Metaxas, Eric (2017) ''Martin Luther: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World'', New York: Viking Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the [[Hammelburg]] Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrank, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city's independence was endangered. In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] and the city lost its independence. The Electorate built a huge fortress on Petersberg hill between 1665 and 1726 to control the city and instituted a governor to rule Erfurt.\n\nDuring the late 18th century, Erfurt saw another cultural peak. Governor [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]] had close relations with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who often visited him at his court in Erfurt.\n\n=== Erfurt during the Napoleonic Wars ===\n{{main article|Principality of Erfurt}}\n[[File:Die Napoleonsh\u00f6he im Steiger bei Erfurt von NH Dornheim.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|de|Die Napoleonsh\u00f6he im Steiger bei Erfurt}}'', painted by {{Interlanguage link multi|Nikolaus Dornheim|de|3=Nikolaus Christian Heinrich Dornheim}} in 1812.

An attempt in this direction was the failed [[Erfurt Union]] of German states in 1850.\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] reached Erfurt in the 1840s, when the [[Thuringian Railway]] connecting [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]] was built. During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the \"Royal Gun Factory of [[Prussia]]\" in 1862. After the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed. The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (such as a tramway, hospitals, and schools) improved rapidly. The number of inhabitants grew from 40,000 around 1870 to 130,000 in 1914 and the city expanded in all directions.\n\nThe \"[[Erfurt Program]]\" was adopted by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] during its congress at Erfurt in 1891.\n\nBetween the wars, the city kept growing. Housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Great Depression]] between 1929 and 1932 led to a disaster for Erfurt, nearly one out of three became unemployed. Conflicts between far-left and far-right-oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new Nazi government and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Others, especially some communist workers, put up resistance against the new administration. In 1938, the new synagogue was destroyed during the {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}}. Jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]] (together with many communists). In 1914, the company ''[[Topf and Sons]]'' began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry. Under the Nazis, ''JA Topf & Sons'' supplied specially developed crematoria, ovens and associated plants to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Buchenwald]] and [[Mauthausen-Gusen]] concentration camps. On 27 January 2011 a memorial and museum dedicated to the Holocaust victims was opened at the former company premises in Erfurt.\n\nBombed as a target of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]], Erfurt suffered only limited damage and was captured on 12 April 1945, by the US [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]].<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939\u20131946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 150</ref> On 3 July, American troops left the city, which then became part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet Zone of Occupation]] and eventually of the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]). In 1948, Erfurt became the capital of [[Thuringia]], replacing [[Weimar]]. In 1952, the {{lang|de|[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]}} in the GDR were dissolved in favour of centralization under the new socialist government. Erfurt then became the capital of a new \"{{lang|de|[[Erfurt (Bezirk)|Bezirk]]}}\" (district). In 1953, the {{lang|de|[[Hochschule]]}} of education was founded, followed by the {{lang|de|Hochschule}} of medicine in 1954, the first academic institutions in Erfurt since the closing of the university in 1816.\n\nOn 19 March 1970, the East and West German heads of government [[Willi Stoph]] and [[Willy Brandt]] met in Erfurt, the first such meeting since the division of Germany. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the economic situation in GDR worsened, many old buildings in city centre decayed, while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} settlements in the periphery. The [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989/1990 led to [[German reunification]].\n\n[[File:DDR Street signs.jpg|thumb|Socialist-era street signs removed from around the city of Erfurt after 1990]]\nWith the re-formation of the state of [[Thuringia]] in 1990, the city became the state capital. After reunification, a deep economic crisis occurred in Eastern Germany. Many factories closed and many people lost their jobs and moved to the former West Germany. At the same time, many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively. In 1994, the new university was opened, as was the Fachhochschule in 1991. Between 2005 and 2008, the economic situation improved as the unemployment rate decreased and new enterprises developed. In addition, the population began to increase once again.\n\n== Geography and demographics ==\n[[File:Erfurt.Gera Fluss.jpg|thumb|Gera river in the city centre]]\n\n=== Topography ===\nErfurt is situated in the south of the [[Thuringian basin]], a fertile agricultural area between the [[Harz]] mountains {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north and the [[Thuringian forest]] {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the southwest. Whereas the northern parts of the city area are flat, the southern ones consist of hilly landscape up to 430 m of elevation. In this part lies the municipal forest of ''{{lang|de|Steigerwald}}'' with [[Fagus sylvatica|beeches]] and [[Quercus robur|oaks]] as main tree species. To the east and to the west are some non-forested hills so that the [[Gera (river)|Gera]] river valley within the town forms a basin. North of the city are some [[gravel pit]]s in operation, while others are abandoned, flooded and used as leisure areas.\n\n=== Climate ===\nErfurt has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb) or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system.<ref name = koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The population then more or less stagnated until the 19th century. The population of Erfurt was 21,000 in 1820, and increased to 32,000 in 1847, the year of rail connection as industrialization began. In the following decades Erfurt grew up to 130,000 at the beginning of World War I and 190,000 inhabitants in 1950. A maximum was reached in 1988 with 220,000 persons. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 200,000 in 2002 before rising again to 206,000 in 2011. The average growth of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.68% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Erfurt. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.\n\nThe birth deficit was 200 in 2012, this is -1.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>According to {{lang|de|[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik]}}</ref> The most important regions of origin of Erfurt migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]] as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan and Hungary.\n\nLike other eastern German cities, foreigners account only for a small share of Erfurt's population: circa 3.0% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.9% are migrants (according to the [[2011 EU census]]).\n\nDue to the official atheism of the former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 14.8% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 6.8% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census).

The \"grand stage\" section has 800 seats and the \"studio stage\" can hold 200 spectators. In September 2005, the opera ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians (opera)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]'' by [[Philip Glass]] premiered in the opera house. The Erfurt Theater has been a source of controversy recently. In 2005, a performance of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s opera ''{{lang|de|[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel (opera)|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]}}'' stirred up the local press since the performance contained suggestions of pedophilia and incest. The opera was advertised in the program with the addition \"for adults only\".\n\nOn 12 April 2008, a version of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''{{lang|it|[[Un ballo in maschera]]}}'' directed by Johann Kresnik opened at the Erfurt Theater. The production stirred deep controversy by featuring nude performers in [[Mickey Mouse]] masks dancing on the ruins of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and a female singer with a painted on [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] toothbrush moustache performing a straight arm [[Nazism|Nazi]] salute, along with sinister portrayals of American soldiers, [[Uncle Sam]], and [[Elvis Presley]] impersonators. The director described the production as a populist critique of modern American society, aimed at showing up the disparities between rich and poor. The controversy prompted one local politician to call for locals to boycott the performances, but this was largely ignored and the premi\u00e8re was sold out.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/11/wopera111.xml |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |title=German staging of Verdi's ''A Masked Ball'' on 9/11 with naked cast in Mickey Mouse masks |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\n[[File:Luftbild Gunda Niemann Stirnemann Halle.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|de|Gunda-Niemann-Stirnemann Halle}}'']]\nThe [[Messe Erfurt]] serves as playground for the [[Oettinger Rockets]], a professional basketball team in Germany's first division, the [[Basketball Bundesliga]]. \n\nNotable types of sport in Erfurt are athletics, ice skating, cycling (with the oldest velodrome in use in the world, opened in 1885), swimming, handball, volleyball, tennis and football. The city's football club {{lang|de|[[FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt]]}} is member of {{lang|de|[[3. Fu\u00dfball-Liga]]}} and based in {{lang|de|[[Steigerwaldstadion]]}} with a capacity of 20,000.

In 1873, the city's fortifications were demolished and it became possible to build houses in the area in front of the former city walls. \nIn the following years, Erfurt saw a construction boom. In the northern area (districts Andreasvorstadt, Johannesvorstadt and Ilversgehofen) [[tenement]]s for the factory workers were built whilst the eastern area (Kr\u00e4mpfervorstadt and Daberstedt) featured apartments for white-collar workers and clerks and the southwestern part (L\u00f6bervorstadt and Br\u00fchlervorstadt) with its beautiful valley landscape saw the construction of villas and mansions of rich factory owners and notables.\n\nDuring the interwar period, some settlements in [[Bauhaus]] style were realized, often as housing cooperatives.\n\nAfter World War II and over the whole GDR period, housing shortages remained a problem even though the government started a big apartment construction programme. Between 1970 and 1990 large {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} settlements with high-rise blocks on the northern (for 50,000 inhabitants) and southeastern (for 40,000 inhabitants) periphery were constructed. After reunification the renovation of old houses in city centre and the ''{{lang|de|Gr\u00fcnderzeit}}'' areas was a big issue. The federal government granted substantial subsidies, so that many houses could be restored.\n\nCompared to many other German cities, little of Erfurt was destroyed in World War II. This is one reason why the centre today offers a mixture of medieval, Baroque and [[Neoclassical architecture]] as well as buildings from the last 150 years.\n\nPublic green spaces are located along Gera river and in several parks like the ''{{lang|de|Stadtpark}}'', the ''{{lang|de|Nordpark}}'' and the ''{{lang|de|S\u00fcdpark}}''.

It is the main street of the Latin quarter around the old university and today one of the favourite nightlife districts of the Erfurters with various bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. The central building of the old university, {{lang|la|Collegium Maius}}, was built in 1515, destroyed by Allied bombs in 1945 and originally rebuilt in 1999.\n* The ''{{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}}'' is an inner-city circular road following the former inner city wall. The road was set out in the 1890s by closing a branch of the Gera river. The buildings along the street originate from all periods of the 20th century, including some GDR-era highrise residence buildings. An old building complex here is the former Great Hospital, established in the 14th century. Today, it hosts the museum of popular art and cultural anthropology. \n* The ''{{lang|de|Andreasviertel}}'' (St Andrew's Quarter) is a small quarter in the northern part of the city centre between {{lang|de|Domplatz}} in the south-west and {{lang|de|Moritzwallstra\u00dfe}} in the north-east.

Today, it houses the German horticulture museum.<ref>[https://www.gartenbaumuseum.de/die-cyriaksburg.html  ''Die Cyriaksburg: Sitz des Deutschen Gartenbaumuseums Erfurt'']. Retrieved 23 December 2017</ref>\n\n=====19th- and 20th-century architecture in the outskirts=====\nBetween 1873 and 1914, a belt of ''{{lang|de|[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]}}'' architecture emerged around the city centre. The mansion district in the south-west around {{lang|de|Cyriakstra\u00dfe}}, {{lang|de|Richard-Breslau-Stra\u00dfe}} and {{lang|de|Hochheimer Stra\u00dfe}} hosts some interesting ''{{lang|de|Gr\u00fcnderzeit}}'' and ''Art Nouveau'' buildings.\n\nThe \"M\u00fchlenviertel\" (\"mill quarter\"), is an area of beautiful Art Nouveau apartment buildings, cobblestone streets and street trees just to the north of the old city, in the vicinity of Nord Park, bordered by the Gera river on its east side. The [[Schmale Gera]] stream runs through the area. In the Middle Ages numerous small enterprises using the power of water mills occupied the area, hence the name \"M\u00fchlenviertel\", with street names such as Waidm\u00fchlenweg (woad, or indigo, mill way), Storchm\u00fchlenweg (stork mill way) and Papierm\u00fchlenweg (paper mill way).\n\nThe ''[[Bauhaus]]'' style is represented by some housing cooperative projects in the east around {{lang|de|Flensburger Stra\u00dfe}} and {{lang|de|Dortmunder Stra\u00dfe}} and in the north around {{lang|de|Neuendorfstra\u00dfe}}. Lutherkirke Church in {{lang|de|Magdeburger Allee}} (1927), is an [[Art Deco]] building.\n\nThe former malt factory \"Wolff\" at {{lang|de|Theo-Neubauer-Stra\u00dfe}} in the east of Erfurt is a large industrial complex built between 1880 and 1939, and in use until 2000. A new use has not been found yet, but the area is sometimes used as a location in movie productions because of its atmosphere.\n\nSome examples of Nazi architecture are the buildings of the {{lang|de|Landtag}} (Thuringian parliament) and {{lang|de|Th\u00fcringenhalle}} (an event hall) in the south at {{lang|de|Arnst\u00e4dter Stra\u00dfe}}. While the {{lang|de|Landtag}} building (1930s) represents more the neo-Roman/fascist style, {{lang|de|Th\u00fcringenhalle}} (1940s) is marked by some neo-Germanic ''{{lang|de|Heimatschutz}}'' style elements.\n\nThe Stalinist early-GDR style is manifested in the main building of the university at {{lang|de|Nordh\u00e4user Stra\u00dfe}} (1953) and the later more international modern GDR style is represented by the horticultural exhibition centre \"{{lang|de|Egapark}}\" at {{lang|de|Gothaer Stra\u00dfe}}, the {{lang|de|Plattenbau}} housing complexes like Rieth or {{lang|de|Johannesplatz}} and the redevelopment of {{lang|de|L\u00f6bertor}} and {{lang|de|Kr\u00e4mpfertor}} area along {{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}} in the city centre.\n\nThe current international glass and steel architecture is dominant among most larger new buildings like the Federal Labour Court of Germany (1999), the new opera house (2003), the new main station (2007), the university library, the Erfurt Messe (convention centre) and the {{lang|de|[[Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann]]}} ice rink.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Ernst-Toller-Stra\u00dfe Erfurt.JPG|{{lang|de|Gr\u00fcnderzeit}} tenements in {{lang|de|Johannesvorstadt}} district\nFile:Brunnen Jacobsenviertel Erfurt.JPG|Cubistic fountain in a Bauhaus housing complex\nFile:Lutherkirche Erfurt2.JPG|Art Deco Luther's Church\nFile:Th\u00fcringerLandtag.jpg|Entrance of the Thuringian parliament\nFile:Audimax-Foyer der Universit\u00e4t Erfurt.jpg|Lobby of the university main building\nFile:Statue Johannesplatz Erfurt.JPG|GDR architecture in {{lang|de|Johannesplatz}} district\nFile:2011-05-19-bundesarbeitsgericht-by-RalfR-24.jpg|Inner yard of the Federal Labour Court\n</gallery>\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nDuring recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 21% in 2005 to 9% in 2013. Nevertheless, some 14,000 households with 24,500 persons (12% of population) are dependent upon state social benefits ([[Hartz concept|Hartz IV]]).\n\n=== Agriculture, industry and services ===\n[[File:Optima-Werk Erfurt.JPG|thumb|Former factory building, now reused for services]]\n[[File:Anger 1 Erfurt Kaufhaus R\u00f6mischer Kaiser 686-vLh.jpg|thumb|''Anger 1'', a big department store in centre]]\n\nFarming has a great tradition in Erfurt: the cultivation of [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] made the city rich during the Middle Ages. Today, horticulture and the production of flower seeds is still an important business in Erfurt. There is also growing of fruits (like apples, strawberries and sweet cherries), vegetables (e.g. cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage and sugar beets) and grain on more than 60% of the municipal territory.\n\nIndustrialization in Erfurt started around 1850. Until World War I, many factories were founded in different sectors like engine building, shoes, guns, malt and later electro-technics, so that there was no industrial monoculture in the city. After 1945, the companies were nationalized by the [[East Germany|GDR]] government, which led to the decline of some of them. After reunification, nearly all factories were closed, either because they failed to successfully adopt to a free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, in the early 1990s the federal government started to subsidize the foundation of new companies. It still took a long time before the economic situation stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment has decreased and overall, new jobs were created. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Erfurt with electro-technics, semiconductors and photovoltaics in focus. Building engines, the production of food (i.e. a big noodle factory), the [[Braugold]] brewery, and [[Born Feinkost]] a producer of Thuringian mustard, are still an important industries.\n\nErfurt is an ''{{lang|de|Oberzentrum}}'' (which means \"supra-centre\" according to [[Central place theory]]) in German regional planning. Such centres are always hubs of service businesses and public services like hospitals, universities, research, trade fairs, retail etc. Additionally, Erfurt is the capital of the federal state of Thuringia, so that there are many institutions of administration like all the Thuringian state ministries and some nationwide authorities. Typical for Erfurt are the logistic business with many distribution centres of big companies, the [[Erfurt Trade Fair]] and the media sector with [[KiKa]] and [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] as public broadcast stations. A growing industry is tourism, due to the various historical sights of Erfurt. There are 4,800 hotel beds and (in 2012) 450,000 overnight visitors spent a total of 700,000 nights in hotels. Nevertheless, most tourists are one-day visitors from Germany. The Christmas Market in December attracts some 2,000,000 visitors each year.\n\n=== Transport ===\n[[File:Erfurt Hbf Front.JPG|thumb|[[Erfurt Hauptbahnhof]], Erfurt's main railway station.]]\n\n==== By rail ====\nThe [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] railway network makes Erfurt 1\u00bd hours from [[Berlin]], 2 hours from [[Frankfurt]] and [[Dresden]], and 45 minutes from [[Leipzig]]. In 2017, the ICE line to [[Munich]] has opened, making the trip to Erfurt only 2 hours.\n\nThere are regional trains from Erfurt to [[Weimar]], [[Jena]], [[Gotha]], [[Eisenach]], [[Bad Langensalza]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Nordhausen]], [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[M\u00fchlhausen]], [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Meiningen]], [[Ilmenau]], [[Arnstadt]], and [[Gera]] .\n\nIn freight transport there is an [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminal in the district of Vieselbach ''({{lang|de|G\u00fcterverkehrszentrum, GVZ}})'' with connections to rail and the autobahn.\n\n==== By road ====\nThe two [[Autobahn]]en crossing each other nearby at ''Erfurter Kreuz'' are the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] ([[Frankfurt]]\u2013[[Dresden]]) and the [[Bundesautobahn 71]] ([[Schweinfurt]]\u2013[[Sangerhausen]]). Together with the east tangent both motorways form a circle road around the city and lead the interregional traffic around the centre. Whereas the A 4 was built in the 1930s, the A 71 came into being after the reunification in the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to both motorways there are two [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n: the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 7]] connects Erfurt parallel to A 4 with [[Gotha]] in the west and [[Weimar]] in the east. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 4]] is a connection between Erfurt and [[Nordhausen]] in the north. Its southern part to [[Coburg]] was annulled when A 71 was finished (in this section, the A 71 now effectively serves as B 4). Within the circle road, B 7 and B 4 are also annulled, so that the city government has to pay for maintenance instead of the German federal government. The access to the city is restricted as ''{{lang|de|[[Low-emission zone|Umweltzone]]}}'' since 2012 for some vehicles. Large parts of the inner city are a pedestrian area which can not be reached by car (except for residents).\n\n==== By light rail and bus ====\n[[File:Erfurt Stra\u00dfenbahn Schl\u00f6sserstr.JPG|thumb|Light rail tram near Anger square]]\nThe Erfurt public transport system is marked by the area-wide {{lang|de|[[Erfurt Stadtbahn]]}} ([[light rail]]) network, established as a tram system in 1883, upgraded to a light rail ( ''{{lang|de|Stadtbahn}}'' ) system in 1997,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stadtwerke-erfurt.de/pb/site/swegruppe/node/140107/Lde/index.html |title=Ausbau der Erfurter Stra\u00dfenbahn zur Stadtbahn |publisher=Essener Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (EVAG) |language=German |trans-title=Expansion of Erfurt tram to light rail |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> and continually expanded and upgraded through the 2000s. Today, there are six ''Stadtbahn'' lines running every ten minutes on every light rail route.\n\nAdditionally, Erfurt operates a bus system, which connects the sparsely populated outer districts of the region to the city center. Both systems are organized by ''SWE EVAG'', a transit company owned by the city administration. Trolleybuses were in service in Erfurt from 1948 until 1975, but are no longer in service.\n\n==== By airplane ====\n[[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]] lies {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city centre. It is linked to the central train station via Stadtbahn (tram). It was significantly extended in the 1990s, with flights mostly to Mediterranean holiday destinations and to London during the peak Christmas market tourist season. Connections to longer haul flights are easily accessible via [[Frankfurt Airport]], which can be reached in 2 hours via a direct train from Frankfurt Airport to Erfurt, and from [[Leipzig Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle Airport]], which can be reached within half an hour.\n\n==== By bike ====\nBiking is becoming increasingly popular since construction of high quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. There are cycle lanes for general commuting within Erfurt city.\n\nLong-distance trails, such as the ''Gera track'' and the ''{{lang|de|Radweg Th\u00fcringer St\u00e4dtekette}}'' (Thuringian cities trail), connect points of tourist interest.  The former runs along the [[Gera (river)|Gera]] river valley from the [[Thuringian forest]] to the river [[Unstrut]]; the latter follows the medieval [[Via Regia]] from [[Eisenach]] to [[Altenburg]] via [[Gotha]], Erfurt, [[Weimar]], and [[Jena]].\n\nThe [[Rennsteig Cycle Way]] was opened in 2000. This designated high-grade hiking and bike trail runs along the ridge of the Thuringian Central Uplands. The bike trail, about {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} long, occasionally departs from the course of the historic Rennsteig hiking trail, which dates back to the 1300s, to avoid steep inclines. It is therefore about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} longer than the hiking trail.\n\nThe Rennsteig is connected to the [[E3 European long distance path]], which goes from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, and the [[E6 European long distance path]], running from Arctic Finland to Turkey.\n\n=== Education ===\nAfter reunification, the educational system was reorganized. The [[University of Erfurt]], founded in 1379<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and closed in 1816, was refounded in 1994 with a focus on social sciences, modern languages, humanities and teacher training. Today there are approximately 6,000 students working within four faculties, the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, and three academic research institutes.<ref>[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/faculties-institutes-services/ Faculties, Institutes & Services<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The University has an international reputation and participates in international student exchange programmes.<ref>[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/international/incoming/ Universit\u00e4t Efurt. International Students]. Retrieved 15 January 2018</ref>\n\nThe ''Fachhochschule Erfurt'', is a [[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]], founded in 1991, which offers a combination of academic training and practical experience in subjects such as social work and social pedagogy, business studies, and engineering. There are  nearly 5,000 students in six faculties, of which the faculty of landscaping and horticulture has a national reputation.\n\nThe [[International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn|International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn (IUBH)]], is a privately run university with a focus on business and economics. It merged with the former Adam-Ries-Fachhochschule in 2013.\n\nThe world renowned [[Bauhaus]] design school was founded in 1919 in the city of [[Weimar]],<ref>[https://www.bauhaus-2019.de/cms/website.php?id=/en/index.htm Bauhaus 2019.

The buildings are now part of a [[World Heritage Site]] and are today used by the [[Bauhaus-Universit\u00e4t Weimar]], which teaches design, arts, media and technology related subjects.\n\nFurthermore, there are eight ''{{lang|de|[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasien]]}}'', six state-owned, one Catholic and one Protestant. One of the state-owned schools is a ''{{lang|de|Sportgymnasium}}'', an elite boarding school for young talents in athletics, swimming, ice skating or football. Another state-owned school, ''{{lang|de|Albert Schweitzer Gymnasium}}'', offers a focus in sciences as an elite boarding school in addition to the common curriculum.\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThe German national public television children\u2019s channel ''[[KiKa]]'' is based in Erfurt.\n\nMDR, [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]], a radio and television company, has a broadcast centre and studios in Erfurt.\n\nThe [[Th\u00fcringer Allgemeine]] is a state-wide newspaper that is headquartered in the city.<ref>[http://www.thueringer-allgemeine.de/kontakt Th\u00fcringer Allgemeine.

Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of [[Gweedore]] in [[County Donegal]], Enya began her music career when she joined her family's [[Celtic music|Celtic]] band [[Clannad]] in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals. She left in 1982 with their manager and producer [[Nicky Ryan]] to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife [[Roma Ryan]] as her lyricist. Enya developed her sound over the following four years with multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements of [[New-age music|new age]], Celtic, classical, church, and folk music. She has sung in ten languages.\n\nEnya's first projects as a solo artist included soundtrack work for ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1984) and the 1987 [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]'', which was released as her debut album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]'' (1987). She signed with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]], which granted her artistic freedom and minimal interference from the label. The commercial and critical success of ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'' (1988) propelled her to worldwide fame, helped by the international top-10 hit single \"[[Orinoco Flow]]\". This was followed by the multi-million selling albums ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'' (1991), ''[[The Memory of Trees]]'' (1995) and ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'' (2000). Sales of the latter and its lead single, \"[[Only Time]]\", surged in the United States following its use in the media coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Zones in Germany|sector]] of [[Berlin]] established in 1945. The American, British, and French sectors became [[West Berlin]], strongly associated with [[West Germany]], while East Berlin was the ''de facto'' [[Capital of Germany|capital]] of [[East Germany]]. From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989, East Berlin was separated from [[West Berlin]] by the [[Berlin Wall]].\n\nIn East German official usage, it became widespread in the 1970s to refer to the Western part of the city as \"Westberlin\", whilst calling the Eastern part simply \"Berlin\". Officially it was referred to as \"Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR\" (\"Berlin, Capital of the GDR\") (see also [[West Berlin#Naming conventions|Naming conventions]]).\n\n==Overview==\n\nWith the [[London Protocol (1944)|London Protocol of 1944]] signed on September 12, 1944, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union decided to divide Germany into three occupation zones and to establish a special area of Berlin, which was occupied by the three Allied Forces together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/germany-1945-1949-a-case-study-in-post-conflict-reconstruction|title=Germany 1945-1949: a case study in post-conflict reconstruction|last=Knowles|first=Chris|date=29 January 2014 |website=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> In May 1945, the Soviet Union installed a city government for the whole city that was called \"Magistrate of Greater Berlin\", which existed until 1947. After the war, the Allied Forces initially administered the city together within the [[Allied Kommandatura]], which served as the governing body of the city. However, in 1948 the Soviet representative left the Kommandatura and the common administration broke apart during the following months. In the Soviet sector, a separate city government was established, which continued to call itself \"Magistrate of Greater Berlin\".\n\nWhen the [[German Democratic Republic]] was established in 1949, it immediately claimed East Berlin as its capital - a claim that was recognised by all [[Communist countries]]. Nevertheless, its representatives to the [[People's Chamber]] were not directly elected and did not have full voting rights until 1981.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sOVRAQAAIAAJ&dq=east+berlin+volkskammer+voting+rights&q=voting+rights#v=snippet&q=voting%20rights&f=false ''Berlin seit dem Kriegsende''], Helmut Peitsch, Manchester University Press, 1989 page 18</ref>\n\nIn June 1948, all railways and roads leading to West Berlin were [[Berlin Blockade|blocked]], and East Berliners were not allowed to emigrate. Nevertheless, more than 1,000 East Germans were [[Republikflucht|escaping]] to West Berlin each day by 1960, caused by the strains on the East German economy from war reparations owed to the Soviet Union, massive destruction of industry, and lack of assistance from the [[Marshall Plan]]. In August 1961, the [[Politics of East Germany|East German Government]] tried to stop the population exodus by building the [[Berlin Wall]]. It was very dangerous for fleeing residents to cross because [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|armed soldiers]] were trained to [[Schie\u00dfbefehl|shoot illegal migrants]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Berlin|last = Conrad Stein|first = R.|publisher = Children's Press|year = 1997 |pages = 29}}</ref>\n\nEast Germany was a [[socialist republic]], but there was not complete [[economic equality]]. Privileges such as prestigious apartments and good schooling were given to members of the ruling party and their family. Eventually, Christian churches were allowed to operate without restraint after years of harassment by authorities. In the 1970s, wages of East Berliners rose and working hours fell.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = The Berlin Wall\n| last = Grant\n| first = R.G,\n| publisher = Steck-Vaughn Company\n| year = 1999\n| isbn = \n| location = \n| pages = \n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] (the [[United States|US]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[France]]) never formally acknowledged the authority of the East German government to govern East Berlin; the official Allied protocol recognised only the authority of the [[Soviet Union]] in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole. The United States Command Berlin, for example, published detailed instructions for U.S. military and civilian personnel wishing to visit East Berlin.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Helpful Hints for US Visitors to East Berlin | publisher = Headquarters, U.S. Command Berlin | date = 1981-11-09 | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/USCOB_Hints_on_Visiting_East_Berlin_-_19811109.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref> In fact, the three Western commandants regularly protested against the presence of the East German [[National People's Army]] (NVA) in East Berlin, particularly on the occasion of military parades. Nevertheless, the three Western Allies eventually established embassies in East Berlin in the 1970s, although they never recognised it as the capital of East Germany. Treaties instead used terms such as \"seat of government.\"<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA158&dq=Embassy%20of%20the%20French%20Republic%20in%20Berlin%20gdr&pg=PA159#v=onepage&q=sitz%20der&f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, pages 159</ref>\n\nOn 3 October 1990, East and West Germany and East and West Berlin [[German reunification|were reunited]], thus formally ending the existence of East Berlin.\n\n==East Berlin today==\n\nSince reunification, the German government has spent vast amounts of money on reintegrating the two halves of the city and bringing services and infrastructure in the former East Berlin up to the standard established in West Berlin.\n\nAfter reunification, the East German economy suffered significantly. Many East German factories were shut down due to inability to comply with West German pollution and safety standards, as well as inability to compete with West German factories. Because of this, a massive amount of West German economic aid was poured into East Germany to revitalize it. This stimulus was part-funded through a 7.5% tax on income, which led to a great deal of resentment toward the East Germans.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = The Berlin Wall\n| last = Grant\n| first = R.G.\n| publisher = Steck-Vaughn Company\n| year = 1999\n| isbn = \n| location = \n| pages = \n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the large sums of economic aid poured into East Berlin, there still remain obvious differences between the former East and West Berlin. East Berlin has a distinct visual style; this is partly due to the greater survival of prewar fa\u00e7ades and streetscapes, with some even still showing signs of wartime damage. The unique look of [[Stalinist architecture]] that was used in East Berlin (along with the rest of the former GDR) also contrasts markedly with the urban development styles employed in the former West Berlin. Additionally, the former East Berlin (along with the rest of the former GDR) retains a small number of its GDR-era street and place names commemorating German socialist heroes, such as [[Karl-Marx-Allee]], [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]], and [[Karl-Liebknecht-Stra\u00dfe]]. Many such names, however, were deemed inappropriate (for various reasons) and changed after a long process of review.\n\nAnother popular symbolic icon of the former East Berlin (and of East Germany as a whole) is the \"[[Ampelm\u00e4nnchen]]\" (tr. \"little traffic light men\"), a stylized version of a fedora-wearing man crossing the street, which is found on traffic lights at many pedestrian crosswalks throughout the former East. These days they are also visible in parts of the former West Berlin. Following a civic debate about whether the Ampelm\u00e4nnchen should be abolished or disseminated more widely (due to concerns of consistency), several crosswalks in some parts of the former West Berlin also employ the Ampelm\u00e4nnchen.\n\nEven to this day, 25 years after the two cities were reunified, the people of East and West Berlin have noticeable differences between each other, which become more apparent among the older generations. The two groups also have sometimes-derogatory slang terms to refer to each other. A former East Berliner (or East German) is known as an \"''Ossi''\" (from the German word for east, ''Ost''), and a former West Berliner (or West German) is known as a \"''Wessi''\" (from the German word for west, ''West''). Both sides also engage in stereotyping the other. A stereotypical ''Ossi'' has little ambition or poor work ethic and is chronically bitter, while a stereotypical ''Wessi'' is arrogant, selfish, impatient, and pushy.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Berlin|last = Conrad Stein|first = R.|publisher = Children's Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 14}}</ref>\n\n==Soviet and East German Commandants of East Berlin==\n{|  style=\"text-align: left;  border-collaps:collapse; line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+\n!

{{lang-el|\u03ad\u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}}) is the fifth letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], corresponding phonetically to a [[mid<!-- not close-mid, see Arvanti (1999) - Illustrations of the IPA: Modern Greek. --> front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}. In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it also has the value five. It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[He (letter)|He]] [[File:Phoenician he.svg|20px|He]]. Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman [[E]], [[\u00cb]] and [[Latin epsilon|\u0190]], and Cyrillic [[Ye (Cyrillic)|\u0415]], [[Ye with grave|\u00c8]], [[Yo (Cyrillic)|\u0401]], [[Ukrainian Ye|\u0404]] and [[E (Cyrillic)|\u042d]].\n\nThe name of the letter was originally {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f36}} ({{IPA-el|\u00ea\u02d0|anc}}), but the name was changed to {{lang|grc|\u1f12 \u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03bd}} (''e psilon'' \"simple e\") in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b9}}, a former [[diphthong]] that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon.\n\nIn essence, the uppercase form of epsilon looks identical to Latin E. The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from [[History of the Greek alphabet|medieval Greek handwriting]]. One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed \"3\". The other, also known as [[lunate]] or [[uncial script|uncial]] epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing,<ref name=\"nicholas1\">Nick Nicholas: [http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/letters.html Letters], 2003\u20132008. (''Greek Unicode Issues'')</ref><ref name=\"colwell\">{{cite book|last=Colwell|first=Ernest C.|chapter=A chronology for the letters \u0395, \u0397, \u039b, \u03a0 in the Byzantine minuscule book hand|title=Studies in methodology in textual criticism of the New Testament|year=1969|place=Leiden|publisher=Brill|pages=127}}</ref> looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar. While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols. Computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them.<ref name=\"nicholas1\"/> In [[Unicode]], the character U+03F5 \"Greek lunate epsilon symbol\" (\u03f5) is provided specifically for the lunate form. In [[TeX]], <code>\\epsilon</code> (<math>\\epsilon\\!</math>) denotes the lunate form, while <code>\\varepsilon</code> (<math>\\varepsilon\\!</math>) denotes the reversed-3 form.\n\nThere is also a [[Latin epsilon]] or \"open e\", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. It is encoded in Unicode as U+025B (\"Latin small-letter open e\", \u025b) and U+0190 (\"Latin capital-letter open e\", \u0190) and is used as an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic symbol. The lunate or uncial epsilon has also provided inspiration for the [[euro sign]] (\u20ac).\n\nThe lunate epsilon (\u03f5) is not to be confused with the [[set membership]] symbol (\u2208); nor should the Latin uppercase epsilon (\u0190) be confused with the Greek uppercase [[sigma]] (\u03a3).  The symbol <math>\\in</math>, first used in set theory and logic by [[Giuseppe Peano]] and now used in mathematics in general for set membership (\"belongs to\") did, however, ''evolve'' from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word \"'''e'''st\".  In addition, mathematicians often read the symbol <math>\\in</math> as \"'''e'''lement of\", as in \"1 is an element of the natural numbers\" for <math>1\\in\\N</math>, for example.  As late as 1960, <math>\\epsilon</math> itself was used for set membership, while its negation \"does not belong to\" (now <math>\\notin</math>) was denoted by <math>\\epsilon'</math> (epsilon prime).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Naive Set Theory|last=Halmos|first=Paul R.|publisher=Van Nostrand|year=1960|isbn=978-1614271314|location=New York|pages=5-6}}</ref>  Only gradually did a fully separate, stylized symbol take the place of epsilon in this role.  In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon, <math>\\backepsilon</math>, for the phrase \"such that\", although the abbreviation \"s.t.\" is occasionally used in place of <math>\\backepsilon</math> in informal writing.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\nThe letter \u0395 was taken over from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[He (letter)|He]] ([[File:Phoenician he.svg|inline|x12px]]) when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing. In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter. Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward ([[File:Greek Epsilon left.svg|inline|x14px]][[File:Greek Epsilon archaic.svg|inline|x14px]]), depending on the current writing direction, but, just as in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing. Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar. In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current E glyph.<ref name=\"jeffery63\">{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Lilian H.|title=The local scripts of archaic Greece|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon|year=1961|pages=63\u201364}}</ref>\n\n===Sound value===\nWhile the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter ''He'' was {{IPA|[h]}}, the earliest Greek sound value of \u0395 was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an {{IPA|[e]}} sound.<ref name=\"jeffery24\">Jeffery, ''Local scripts'', p.24.</ref> Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short {{IPA|/e/}} phoneme, it could initially also be used for other {{IPA|[e]}}-like sounds. For instance, in early [[Attic Greek|Attic]] before c.500 B.C., it was used also both for the long, [[open-mid vowel|open]] {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, and for the long [[close-mid vowel|close]] {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}. In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by [[Eta]] (\u0397), which was taken over from eastern [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] spelling \u0395\u0399.\n\n===Epichoric alphabets===\nSome dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.\n\nIn [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the normal function of \u0395 to denote {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B ([[File:Greek Beta archaic.svg|inline|x14px]]), while \u0395 was used only for long close {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}.<ref name=\"jeffery114\">Jeffery, ''Local scripts'', p.114.</ref> The letter [[Beta]], in turn, took the deviant shape [[File:Greek Beta Corinth 1.svg|inline|x14px]].\n\nIn [[Sicyon]], a variant glyph resembling an X ([[File:Greek Epsilon X-shaped.svg|inline|x14px]]) was used in the same function as Corinthian [[File:Greek Beta archaic.svg|inline|x14px]].<ref name=\"jeffery138\">Jeffery, ''Local scripts'', p.138.</ref>\n\nIn [[Thespiai]] ([[Boeotia]]), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar ([[File:Greek Eta tack.svg|inline|x12px]]) was used for what was probably a [[close vowel|raised]] variant of {{IPA|/e/}} in pre-vocalic environments.<ref name=\"nicholas2\">{{cite web |last=Nicholas |first=Nick |title=Proposal to add Greek epigraphical letters to the UCS |url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/epigraphical.pdf |accessdate=2010-08-12 |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20060505085846/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/epigraphical.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-05 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"jeffery89\">Jeffery, ''Local scripts'', p.89.</ref> This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of \"[[Heta]]\", i.e. for the sound {{IPA|/h/}}.\n\n{{anchor|\u03f5|Lunate epsilon|lunate epsilon}}<!--linked from [[Romanization of Greek]], [[\u03f5]], [[Lunate epsilon]], &c.-->\n===Glyph variants===\nAfter the establishment of the {{cl-span|canonical classic Greek alphabet|date=March 2013}}, new glyph variants for \u0395 were introduced through handwriting. In the [[uncial script]] (used for literary [[papyrus]] manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval [[vellum]] codices), the \"[[lunate]]\" shape ([[File:Greek uncial Epsilon.svg|inline|x12px]]) became predominant. In [[cursive]] handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways.<ref name=\"thompson\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward M.|title=An introduction to Greek and Latin palaeography|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon|year=1911|pages=191\u2013194}}</ref> Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin \"e\", some a \"6\" with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small \"c\"-like curves.

Inscriptions: HERMES - HYPNOS.]]\n{{main|Heta (letter)}}\nThe letter shape 'H' was originally used in most Greek dialects to represent the sound /h/, a [[voiceless glottal fricative]]. In this function, it was borrowed in the 8th century BC by the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan and other Old Italic alphabets]], which were based on the [[Cumaean alphabet|Euboean]] form of the Greek alphabet. This also gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter [[H]].\n\nOther regional variants of the Greek alphabet ([[epichoric alphabets]]), in dialects that still preserved the sound /h/, employed various glyph shapes for consonantal ''heta'' side by side with the new vocalic ''eta'' for some time. \nIn the southern Italian colonies of [[Heraclea Lucania|Heracleia]] and [[Taranto|Tarentum]], the letter shape was reduced to a \"half-heta\" lacking the right vertical stem (\u0370). From this sign later developed the sign for [[rough breathing]] or ''spiritus asper'',  which brought back the marking of the  /h/ sound into the standardized post-classical ([[Greek diacritics|polytonic]]) orthography.<ref name=\"Nicholas\">[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/unicode_aitch.html Nick Nicholas (2003), \"Greek /h/\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130901210905/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis//unicode/unicode_aitch.html |date=2013-09-01 }}</ref>\n[[Dionysius Thrax]] in the second century BC records that the letter name was still pronounced ''heta'' (\u1f25\u03c4\u03b1), correctly explaining this irregularity by stating \"in the old days the letter \u0397 served to stand for the rough breathing, as it still does with the Romans.\"<ref>{{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0397 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u1ff3 \u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f14\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf, \u1f65\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u1fe6\u03bd <\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70> \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2}} \nAlfredus Hilgard (ed), \"In artis Dionysianae \u00a76\" in ''Grammatici Graeci.

This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.\n\n===Itacism===\nDuring the time of post-classical [[Koin\u00e9 Greek]], the {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} sound represented by eta was [[Vowel height|raised]] and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels, a phenomenon called ''itacism'' after the new pronunciation of the letter name as ''ita'' instead of ''eta''.\n\nItacism is continued into [[Modern Greek]], where the letter name  is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8ita]}} and represents the sound /i/ (a [[close front unrounded vowel]]). It shares this function with several other letters ([[Iota|\u03b9]], [[Upsilon|\u03c5]]) and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (\u03b5\u03b9, \u03bf\u03b9), which are all pronounced alike. This phenomenon at large is called [[iotacism]].\n\n===Cyrillic script===\nEta was also borrowed with the sound value of [i] into the [[Cyrillic script]], where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter [[I (Cyrillic)|\u0418]].\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Letter===\nIn [[Modern Greek]], due to [[iotacism]], the letter (pronounced {{IPA-el|\u02c8ita|}}) represents a [[close front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/i/}}. In [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], it represented a long [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}.\n\n===Symbol===\n\n====Upper case====\nThe uppercase letter \u0397 is used as a symbol in [[textual criticism]] for the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (from [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], its once-supposed editor).\n\nIn [[chemistry]], the letter H as symbol of [[enthalpy]] sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from \u1f10\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin [[H]] for 'heat'.\n\nIn information theory the uppercase Greek letter H is used to represent the concept of [[Entropy_(information_theory)#Definition|entropy]] of a discrete random variable.\n\n====Lower case====\nThe lowercase letter \u03b7 is used as a symbol in:\n*[[Thermodynamics]], the efficiency of a [[Carnot heat engine]], or [[packing density|packing fraction]].\n*[[Chemistry]], the [[hapticity]], or the number of atoms of a ligand attached to one coordination site of the metal in a [[coordination compound]].

The earliest positively identified [[Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures ([[Early Paleo-Eskimo]]) date to 5,000 years ago. They appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the [[Arctic small tool tradition]] in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier. Similar artifacts have been found in Siberia that date to perhaps 18,000 years ago.\n\nThe Yupik languages and cultures in Alaska evolved in place (and migrated back to Siberia), beginning with the original [[pre-Dorset]] indigenous culture developed in Alaska. Approximately 4000 years ago, the Unangan culture of the [[Aleut]] became distinct. It is not generally considered an Eskimo culture.\n\nApproximately 1,500\u20132,000 years ago, apparently in northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across northern Alaska, through Canada and into Greenland. The distinct culture of the [[Thule people]] developed in northwestern Alaska and very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo people, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\n===Origin===\n{{Further|Native American name controversy}}\n\nTwo principal competing etymologies have been proposed for the name \"Eskimo\", both derived from the [[Innu language|Innu-aimun]] (Montagnais) language, an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of the Atlantic Ocean coast. The most commonly accepted today appears to be the proposal of [[Ives Goddard]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], who derives the term from the Montagnais word meaning \"snowshoe-netter\"<ref name=\"aueo\"/> or \"to net snowshoes.\"<ref name=anlc /> The word ''assime\u00b7w'' means \"she laces a snowshoe\" in Montagnais.

He is highly unlikely to have encountered French traders or their allies in his travels to have picked up a word for the present-day Inuit from them, as the fall of Quebec and the end of French activity in North America was just 6 years prior to his arrival.  On the contrary, trade at Fort Prince of Wales was conducted with the [[Cree]] and [[Chipewyan people|the Chipewyans]], and conducted at the shores of Hudson Bay at that time.  Trade, by ship, with the Esquimaux was one of Hearne's first assignments.  It would be on Hearne's watch that inland exploration would begin.  It was in the company of [[Matonabbee]] on his third attempt to find the sources of the copper in use by indigenous peoples that Hearne encountered the Inuit as described in [[Bloody Falls Massacre|Massacre at Bloody Falls]].  That the word 'esquimaux' as applying to the Inuit would have come from French sources, and from such southerly peoples as the Algonquians seems highly unlikely, but Hearne's use of the term and his manner of spelling it suggest that the term was already in use prior to his arrival in 1766.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===General===\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0440\u044c.jpg|thumb|[[Laminar armour]] from hardened leather reinforced by wood and bones worn by [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|native Siberians]] and Eskimos]]\n[[File:Koryak armor.jpeg|thumb|[[Lamellar armour]] worn by [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|native Siberians]] and Eskimos]]\n\nIn Canada and Greenland, the term ''Eskimo'' has largely been supplanted by the term ''Inuit''.<ref name=anlc /><ref name=\"stern1\"/><ref name=\"ostg1\"/><ref name=\"ahdinuit\">Usage note, [https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Inuit Inuit], ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000</ref> While ''Inuit'' can be accurately applied to all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia.

They are not to be confused with the Aleut, who live further to the southwest, including along the [[Aleutian Islands]]. They traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources such as [[salmon]], [[halibut]], and whales, as well as rich land resources such as berries and land mammals. Alutiiq people today live in coastal fishing communities, where they work in all aspects of the modern economy. They also maintain the cultural value of a subsistence lifestyle.\n\nThe Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the Yupik in the [[Bethel, Alaska]] area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on [[Kodiak Island]], and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern [[Kenai Peninsula]] and in [[Prince William Sound]]. Residents of [[Nanwalek, Alaska|Nanwalek]], located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near [[Seldovia, Alaska|Seldovia]], speak what they call Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the hundreds, Alutiiq communities are working to revitalize their language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alutiiqmuseum.org/learn/the-alutiiq-sugpiaq-people/language/906-language-loss-revitalization|title=Language Loss & Revitalization|website=alutiiqmuseum.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===Central Alaskan Yup'ik===\n{{Main|Yup'ik}}\n''Yup'ik'', with an apostrophe, denotes the speakers of the Central Alaskan [[Yup'ik language]], who live in western Alaska and southwestern Alaska from southern [[Norton Sound]] to the north side of [[Bristol Bay]], on the [[Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta]], and on [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]]. The use of the apostrophe in the name ''Yup'ik'' is a written convention to denote the long pronunciation of the ''p'' sound; but it is spoken the same in other [[Yupik languages]]. Of all the [[Alaska Native languages]], Central Alaskan Yup'ik has the most speakers, with about 10,000 of a total Yup'ik population of 21,000 still speaking the language. The five dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik include General Central Yup'ik, and the Egegik, Norton Sound, Hooper Bay-Chevak, and Nunivak dialects. In the latter two dialects, both the language and the people are called ''Cup'ik''.<ref name=\"centralyup'ik\">{{cite web|publisher = [[Alaska Native Language Center]].

According to this view, mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body and themselves have no causal efficacy on physical events. The appearance that subjective mental states (such as [[intention]]s) influence physical events is merely an illusion. For instance, fear seems to make the heart beat faster, but according to epiphenomenalism the state of the nervous system\u2014not the experience of fear\u2014is what raises the heartbeat.<ref name=\"Walter\">{{cite web|last=Walter|first=Sven|title=Epiphenomenalism|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/#H2|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=University of Bielefeld|accessdate=10 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923005826/http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/#H2|archivedate=23 September 2013|df=}}</ref> Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism is viewed as a form of [[property dualism]].\n\n==Development==\nDuring the seventeenth century, [[Rene Descartes]] argued that animals are subject to mechanical laws of nature. He defended the idea of [[automatic behavior]], or the performance of actions without conscious thought. Descartes questioned how the immaterial mind and the material body can interact causally.<ref name=\"Walter\"/> His interactionist model (1649) held that the body relates to the mind through the pineal gland.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William|chapter=Epiphenomenalism|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 November 2013|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.}}</ref> [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Shadworth Hodgson|Hodgson]] (1870) <ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=Shadworth|title=The Theory of Practice|year=1870|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, & Dyer|location=London}}</ref> and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1874).<ref>Huxley, T. H. (1874). \"On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History\", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.</ref>\n\nThomas Henry Huxley agreed with Descartes that behavior is determined solely by physical mechanisms, but he also believed that humans enjoy an intelligent life. In 1874, Huxley argued that animals are [[Conscious automatism|conscious automata]] in the Presidential Address to the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Huxley proposed that psychical changes are collateral products of physical changes. He termed the stream of consciousness an \"epiphenomenon;\" like the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time, consciousness has no role in determining behavior.<ref name=\"Walter\"/><ref name=\"Robinson\"/>\n\nHuxley defended [[automatic behavior|automatism]] by testing reflex actions, originally supported by Descartes. Huxley hypothesized that frogs that undergo lobotomy would swim when thrown into water, despite being unable to initiate actions. He argued that the ability to swim was solely dependent on the molecular change in the brain, concluding that consciousness is not necessary for reflex actions. According to epiphenomenalism, animals experience pain only as a result of [[neurophysiology]].<ref name=\"Walter\"/><ref name=\"Robinson\"/>\n\nIn 1870, Huxley conducted a case study on a French soldier who had sustained a shot in the [[Franco-Prussian war|Franco-Prussian War]] that fractured his left parietal bone. Every few weeks the soldier would enter a trance-like state, smoking, dressing himself, and aiming his cane like a rifle all while being insensitive to pins, electric shocks, odorous substances, vinegar, noise, and certain light conditions. Huxley used this study to show that consciousness was not necessary to execute these purposeful actions, justifying the assumption that humans are insensible machines. Huxley's mechanistic attitude towards the body convinced him that the brain alone causes behavior.<ref name=\"Walter\"/><ref name=\"Robinson\"/>\n\nIn the early 1900s [[behaviorism|scientific behaviorists]] such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] or mental [[fictionalism]], positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. [[George Santayana]] (1905) believed that all motion has merely physical causes.  Because consciousness is accessory to life and not essential to it, natural selection is responsible for ingraining tendencies to avoid certain contingencies without any conscious achievement involved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Alwyn|title=Stairway to the Mind|year=1995|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York, New York|isbn=9780387943817|page=109}}</ref> By the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the [[cognitive revolution]]. Participants in that revolution, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of \"epiphobia\"\u2014fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.\n\nHowever, since the cognitive revolution, there have been several who have argued for a version of epiphenomenalism. In 1970, [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] proposed his \"new epiphenomenalism\", which states that the body produces a spiritual mind that does not act on the body. How the brain causes a spiritual mind, according to Campbell, is destined to remain beyond our understanding forever (see [[New Mysterianism]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=David|title=Unsnarling the World-Knot|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781556357558|page=5}}</ref> In 2001, [[David Chalmers]] and [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] argued that claims about conscious states should be deduced a priori from claims about physical states alone. They offered that epiphenomenalism bridges, but does not close, the explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal realms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polger|first=Thomas|title=Natural Minds|year=2004|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262661966|pages=37\u201338}}</ref> These more recent versions maintain that only the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental states are epiphenomenal. Imagine both Pierre and a robot eating a cupcake. Unlike the robot, Pierre is conscious of eating the cupcake while the behavior is under way. This subjective experience is often called a ''quale'' (plural [[qualia]]), and it describes the private \"raw feel\" or the subjective \"[[Thomas Nagel|what-it-is-like]]\" that is the inner accompaniment of many mental states. Thus, while Pierre and the robot are both doing the same thing, only Pierre has the inner conscious experience.\n\n[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1982), for example, once espoused the following view:\n\n{{quote|I am what is sometimes known as a \"qualia freak\". I think that there are certain features of bodily sensations especially, but also of certain perceptual experiences, which no amount of purely physical information includes. Tell me everything physical there is to tell about what is going on in a living brain... you won't have told me about the hurtfulness of pains, the itchiness of itches, pangs of jealousy....<ref>Jackson, 1982, p. 127.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to epiphenomenalism, mental states like Pierre's pleasurable experience\u2014or, at any rate, their distinctive qualia\u2014are [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]]; they are side-effects or by-products of physical processes in the body. If Pierre takes a second bite, it is not caused by his pleasure from the first; If Pierre says, \"That was good, so I will take another bite\", his speech act is not caused by the preceding pleasure. The conscious experiences that accompany brain processes are causally impotent. The mind might simply be a byproduct of other properties such as brain size or pathway activation synchronicity, which are adaptive.\n\nSome thinkers draw distinctions between different varieties of epiphenomenalism. In ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between a purely metaphysical sense of epiphenomenalism, in which the epiphenomenon has no causal impact at all, and Huxley's \"steam whistle\" epiphenomenalism, in which effects exist but are not functionally relevant.\n\n==Arguments for==\nA large body of neurophysiological data seems to support epiphenomenalism.  Some of the oldest such data is the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] or \"readiness potential\" in which electrical activity related to voluntary actions can be recorded up to two seconds before the subject is aware of making a decision to perform the action. More recently [[Benjamin Libet]] et al. (1979) have shown that it can take 0.5 seconds before a stimulus becomes part of conscious experience even though subjects can respond to the stimulus in reaction time tests within 200 milliseconds. The conclusions of this experiment have begun to receive some backlash and criticism, mainly by neuroscientists such as Peter Tse, who claim to show that the readiness potential has nothing to do with consciousness at all.<ref>https://www.dartmouth.edu/~peter/pdf/63.pdf</ref> Recent research on the Event Related Potential also shows that conscious experience does not occur until the late phase of the potential (P3 or later) that occurs 300 milliseconds or more after the event. In Bregman's [[Illusory continuity of tones|auditory continuity illusion]], where a pure tone is followed by broadband noise and the noise is followed by the same pure tone it seems as if the tone occurs throughout the period of noise. This also suggests a delay for processing data before conscious experience occurs. Popular science author [[Tor N\u00f8rretranders]] has called the delay the \"[[user illusion]]\", implying that we only have the illusion of conscious control, most actions being controlled automatically by non-conscious parts of the brain with the conscious mind relegated to the role of spectator.\n\nThe scientific data seem to support the idea that conscious experience is created by non-conscious processes in the brain (i.e., there is subliminal processing that becomes conscious experience). These results have been interpreted to suggest that people are capable of action before conscious experience of the decision to act occurs. Some argue that this supports epiphenomenalism, since it shows that the feeling of making a decision to act is actually an epiphenomenon; the action happens before the decision, so the decision did not cause the action to occur.\n<!-- Section removed. See discussion-->\n\n==Arguments against==\nThe most powerful argument against epiphenomenalism is that it is self-contradictory: if we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then our brains know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then our brains should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | first=William | last=Robinson | editor=Edward N. Zalta | year=2015 | title=Epiphenomenalism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition = Fall 2015 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/#SelStu}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some philosophers do not accept this as a rigorous refutation. For example, Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that the personal mind is not the only source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a zombie) could have knowledge about mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 |pages=51\u201370 |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020014221/http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2 |archivedate=2016-10-20 |df= }}</ref> The information about mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia) could have been, in principle, implicitly \"written\" in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created immaterial mind and a detailed \"program\" of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind\u2013body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but it cannot be excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, epiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness can be found in the human brain, and it is proven that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Dennett, reject both epiphenomenalism and the existence of qualia with the same charge that [[Gilbert Ryle]] leveled against a Cartesian \"[[ghost in the machine]]\", that they too are [[category mistake]]s. A quale or conscious experience would not belong to the category of objects of reference on this account, but rather to the category of ways of doing things.\n\n[[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalists]] assert that mental states are well described by their overall role, their activity in relation to the organism as a whole. \"This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a 'calculating machine', but it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century.\"<ref name=\"sep-functionalism\">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Janet |last=Levin |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2010 |title=Functionalism |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/functionalism/}}</ref> In so far as it mediates stimulus and response, a mental [[Function (computer science)|function]] is analogous to a program that processes [[input/output]] in [[automata theory]]. In principle, [[multiple realisability]] would guarantee [[Universal Turing machine|platform dependencies]] can be avoided, whether in terms of hardware and operating system or, ''ex hypothesi'', biology and philosophy. Because a [[high-level language]] is a practical requirement for developing the most complex programs, functionalism implies that a [[non-reductive physicalism]] would offer a similar advantage over a strictly eliminative materialism.\n\n[[Eliminative materialism|Eliminative materialists]] believe \"[[folk psychology]]\" is so unscientific that, ultimately, it will be better to eliminate primitive concepts such as ''mind,'' ''desire'' and ''belief,'' in favor of a future neuro-scientific account. A more moderate position such as [[J. L. Mackie]]'s ''error theory'' suggests that false beliefs should be stripped away from a mental concept without eliminating the concept itself, the legitimate core meaning being left intact.\n\n[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted<ref>[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.</ref> in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a \"conscious veto\", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results.<ref>Dennett, Daniel. (2003) ''Freedom evolves''.</ref> Similar criticism of Libet-style research has been made by neuroscientist Adina Roskies and cognitive theorists Tim Bayne and Alfred Mele.\n\nOthers have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience and a conscious decision occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is \"completely without any power\u2026 as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery\".<ref name=\"Flanagan1992\">{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}</ref>\n\nAdrian G.

Although it does not entail substance dualism, according to Green, epiphenomenalism implies a one-way form of interactionism that is just as hard to conceive of as the two-way form embodied in substance dualism. Green suggests the assumption that it is less of a problem may arise from the unexamined belief that physical events have some sort of primacy over mental ones.\n\n[[Donald Symons]] dismisses epiphenomenalism from an evolutionary perspective. He says that the view that mind is an epiphenomenon of brain activity is not consistent with evolutionary theory, because if mind were functionless, it would have disappeared long ago, as it would not have been favoured by evolution.<ref>Symons, Donald.

In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix ''-ujo'',  for example \"France\" was ''Francujo'', from ''franco'' (a Frenchman).\n\nThe term analogous to ''Francujo'' would be ''Esperantistujo'' (Esperantist-land). However, that would convey the idea of the physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere.\n\nCurrently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix ''-io'' traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features, so now ''Francio'', and recently the form ''Esperantio'' has been used ''i.a.'' in the [[Pasporta Servo]] and the Esperanto Citizens' Community.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of Esperanto}}\nIn 1908, Dr. William Molly attempted to create an Esperanto nation in [[Neutral Moresnet]] known as \"Amikejo\" (place of friendship).

The state island stood in [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Italy]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], during Esperanto events there was a [[Stelo|common currency]] used, but the management has stopped at the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn Europe on 2 June 2001 a number of organizations (they prefer to call themselves establishments) founded the ''[[Esperanta Civito]]'', which \"aims to be a subject of international law\" and \"aims to consolidate the relations between the Esperantists who feel themselves belonging to the diaspora language group which does not belonge to any country\". ''Esperanto Civito'' always uses the name Esperantujo (introduced by [[Hector Hodler]] in 1908), which itself is defined according to their interpretation of ''[[raumism]]'', and the meaning therefore may differ from the traditional Esperanto understanding of the word ''Esperantujo''.\n\nIn April 2007 there was an [[Esperanto Republic]] founded as a joke.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:PS mapo 2015.png|thumb|400x400px|Cities in the world with Pasporta Servo hosts]]\n{{see also|Pasporta Servo|Herzberg am Harz}}\nEsperantujo means any physical place as Esperanto meetings or virtual networks where they meet Esperanto speakers.

However, there is a social hierarchy of associations:\n\n* [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (UEA) is the principal association created in 1908, its central office is located in [[Rotterdam]]. The aim of the UEA is to promote the use of Esperanto, to strive for the solution of the language problem in international relations, to encourage all types of spiritual and material relations among people and ''to nurture among its members a strong sense of solidarity, and to develop in them understanding and respect for other peoples''.\n* Sometimes exist associations by continent, for example the [[European Esperanto Union]]. On the same level exist UEA commissions dedicated to promote spreading of Esperanto in Africa, America (North & South), Asia, Middle-East & North Africa, and Oceania.\n* In at least 120 countries in the world exist national associations: [[Brazilian Esperanto League]], the [[German Esperanto Association]], [[Japanese Esperanto Association]], [[Esperanto-USA]] and [[Australian Esperanto Association]] are examples from all continents across the world. The goals are usually to help teach the language and use of Esperanto in the country.\n* Finally, there exist local associations or [[Esperanto club]]s where volunteers or activists offer courses to learn the language or get to know more about the [[Esperanto culture|culture of Esperanto]]. Sometimes they teach Esperanto in universities or schools.\n\nAlso there are thematic associations worldwide, which are concerned with spirituality, hobbies, science or that brings together Esperantists which share common interests.\n\nThere is also a number of global organizations, such as [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]] (SAT), or the [[World Esperanto Youth Organization]] (TEJO), which has 46 national sections.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n[[Universal Esperanto Association]] is not a governmental system; however, the association represents Esperanto worldwide. In addition to the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]],<ref>[http://ngo-db.unesco.org/d/or/en/1100039679 Pagxo pri UEA en la retejo de Unesko]</ref> the UEA has consultative relationships with [[UNICEF]] and the [[Council of Europe]]<ref name=\"KER\">[http://www.coe.int/en/web/portfolio/self-assessment-grid Esperanto aperas en la [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|KER]]-listo ene de la retejo de Konsilio de Euxropo]</ref> and general cooperative relations with the [[Organization of American States]]. UEA officially collaborate with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) by means of an active connection to the ISO Committee on terminology (ISO/TC 37). The association is active for information on the [[European Union]] and other interstate and international organizations and conferences. UEA is a member of [[European Language Council]], a joint forum of universities and linguistic associations to promote the knowledge of languages and cultures within and outside the European Union. Moreover, on 10 May 2011, the UEA and the [[Infoterm|International Information Center for Terminology]] (Infoterm) signed an Agreement on Cooperation, its objectives are inter exchange information, support each other and help out for projects, meetings, publications in the field of terminology and by which the UEA become Associate Member of Infoterm.\n\n=== Political movement ===\nIn 2003 there was a European political movement called [[Europe\u2013Democracy\u2013Esperanto]] created. Within it is found a European federation that brings together local associations whose statutes depends on the countries. Working language of the movement is Esperanto. The goal is \"to provide the [[European Union]] with the necessary tools to set up member rights democracy\". The [[international auxiliary language|international language]] is a tool to enable cross-border political and social dialogue and actively contribute to peace and understanding between peoples. The original idea in the first ballot was mainly to spread the existence and the use of Esperanto to the general public. However, in France voices have grown steadily: 25067 (2004) 28944 (2009) and 33115 (2014). In this country there are a number of movements which support the issue: [[France \u00c9quit\u00e9]], [[Europe-Libert\u00e9]], and [[Politicat]].\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{See also|Esperanto symbols}}\n[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|thumb|[[Verda Flago]].]]\nThe [[Esperanto-flag]] is called ''Verda Flago'' (Green Flag). It consists of:\n* a rectangular shape, officially with a 2:3 ratio.\n* a green field, where the green color symbolizes hope. There is no indication that any \"official\" color was ever chosen. The color green used varies in different sources.\n* a white, square [[Canton (flag)|canton]] (upper hoist quarter), measuring exactly half the hoist, where the white color symbolizes peace and neutrality.\n* in the canton, a green five-pointed [[Star (heraldry)|star]] known as ''Verda Stelo'' (Green Star), which symbolizes the five continents.\n\nThe anthem is called ''\"La Espero\"'' since 1891: it is a poem written by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. The song is usually sung at the triumphal march composed by [[F\u00e9licien Menu de M\u00e9nil]] in 1909.\n\nThe Jubilee symbol represents the language internally, while the flag represents Esperanto movement. It contains the Latin letter E (Esperanto) and the Cyrillic letter \u042d (\u042d\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e) symbolizing the unification of West and East.\n\nIn addition, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, the initiator of the language, is often used as a symbol. Sometimes he is even called \"Uncle Zam\", referring to the cartoon incarnation of American [[Uncle Sam]].\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:KER-Ekzameno Atestilo C1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Certificate of KER-exam]]\n{{See also|International League of Esperanto Teachers|Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology}}\nIn addition to textbooks, including the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' by Zamenhof, the [[Assimil]]-methods and the video-methods such as [[Muzzy in Gondoland]] of the [[BBC]] and ''[[Pasporto al la tuta mondo]]'', there are many courses for learning online. The local clubs and intensive internships are also very frequent and wealthy executives in the regions where they are active Esperanto association. Moreover, some universities teach Esperanto, and the [[ELTE-ITK|Higher Foreign Language training (University E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd)]] delivers certificates in accordance with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (CEFR).<ref name=\"KER\" /> More than 1600 people have such a certificate around the world: in 2014 around 470 at the level of B1, 510 at the level of B2 and 700 for C1.<ref>[http://edukado.net/ekzamenoj/ker/statistiko Statistikoj pri la atestiloj de KER-ekzamenoj en Edukado.net]</ref> The [[International League of Esperanto Teachers]] (ILEI) is also working to publish learning materials for teachers.\n\nThe [http://universitato.info/kursaro.htm University of Esperanto] offers video lectures in Esperanto, for specialties like Confronting War, Informational Technologies and Astronomy. Courses are also held during the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in the framework of the [[Internacia Kongresa Universitato]] (IKU). After that, [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] uploads the related documents on its website.<ref>[http://uea.org/dokumentoj/IKU/ Kursoj de Internacia Kongresa Universitato]</ref>\n\nScience is an appropriate department for works in Esperanto. For example, the [[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]] (KAEST) occurs in November every year since 1998 in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. Personal initiatives are also common: Doctor of mathematics [[Ulrich Matthias]] created a document about the foundations of Linear Algebra<ref>[http://www.u-matthias.de/verko/lin_alg.pdf ''Fundamentoj de lineara algebro''], Ulrich Matthias</ref> and the American group of [[Maine]] (USA) wrote a guidebook to learn the programming language [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref>[http://esperanto-me.org/pitono/p01_Enhavoj.htm Instruilo por la programlingvo Pitono]</ref>\n\nIn general, Esperanto is used as a [[lingua franca]] in some websites aiming teaching of other languages, such as [[German language|German]],<ref>[http://deutsch.info/eo Deutsch.info instruas la germanan per Esperanto]</ref> [[Slovak language|Slovak]],<ref>[http://slovake.eu/eo/ Slovake.eu instruas la slovakan per Esperanto]</ref> [[Swahili language|Swahili]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye693UXx0WG4 Svahila kurseto] cxe [[YouTube|Jutubo]]</ref> [[Wolof language|Wolof]]<ref>[http://www.esperanto-afriko.org/Wolof%20per%20esperanto.pdf PDF-a enkonduko al la lingvo volofa]</ref> or [[Toki Pona]].<ref>[http://www.tokipona.info/ Tokipona.info instruas Tokiponon per Esperanto]</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nSince 1889 when ''[[La Esperantisto]]'' appeared, and soon other magazines in Esperanto throughout many countries in the world. Some of them are information media of Esperanto associations (''[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]'', ''[[Sennaciulo]]'' and ''[[Kontakto]]''). Online Esperanto magazines like ''[[Libera Folio]]'', launched in 2003, offer independent view of the Esperanto movement, aiming to soberly and critically shed light on current development. Most of the magazines deal with current events; one of such magazines is ''[[Monato]]'', which is read in more than 60 countries. Its articles are written by correspondents from 40 countries, which know the local situation very well.<ref>[http://www.esperanto.be/fel/mon/mon_kolo.php Kolofono de ''Monato'']</ref> Other most popular<ref>[http://esperantorondo.blogspot.fr/2015/07/la-plej-popularaj-esperanto-gazetoj.html Vocxdonado pri la plej popularaj Esperanto-gazetoj]</ref><ref>\u201cLegado de esperantaj gazetoj\u201d, en ''UEA en konscio de Esperantistoj'', p. 39-41</ref> Esperanto newspapers are ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'', ''[[Beletra Almanako]]'', ''[[Literatura Foiro]]'', and ''[[Heroldo de Esperanto]]''. Often national associations magazines are also published in order to inform about the movement in the country, such as ''Le Monde de l'esp\u00e9ranto'' of [[Esp\u00e9ranto-France]]. There are also scientific journals, such as ''[[Scienca Revuo]]'' of [[Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista]] (ISAE).\n\n''[[Muzaiko]]'' is a radio that has broadcast an all-day international program of songs, interviews and current events in Esperanto since 2011. The latest two can be downloaded as podcasts.<ref>[http://muzaiko.info/programeroj/listo-de-la-programeroj Listo de la programoj de Muzaiko.info]</ref> Besides Muzaiko, these other stations offer an hour of Esperanto-language broadcasting of various topics: ''[[Radio Libertaire]]'', ''[[Polskie Radio]]'', ''[[Vatican Radio]]'', ''[[Varsovia Vento]], ''[[Radio Verda]] and ''[[Kern.punkto]]''.\n\n=== Internet ===\nSpread of the [[Internet]] has enabled more efficient communication among Esperanto speakers and slightly replaced slower media such as [[mail]]. Many massively used websites such as [[Facebook]] or [[Google]] offer Esperanto interface.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/translations/ Traduku Fejsbukon]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/eo/ Guglo en Esperanto]</ref> On 15 December 2009, on the occasion of the jubilee of 150th birthday of [[L. L. Zamenhof]], Google additionally made visible the Esperanto flag as a part of their [[Google Doodles]].<ref>[http://www.liberafolio.org/2009/google-festas-la-zamenhof-tagon/ \u201cGoogle festas la Zamenhof-tagon\u201d], artikolo el [[Libera Folio]]</ref> Media as [[Twitter]], [[Telegram]], [[Reddit]] or [[Ipernity]] also contain a significant number of people in this community. In addition, content-providers such as [[WordPress]] and [[YouTube]] also enable bloggers write in Esperanto. Esperanto versions of programs such as the office suite [[LibreOffice]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser, or the educational program about programming [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] are also available. Additionally, online games like [[Minecraft]] offer complete Esperanto interface.\n\n=== Sport ===\nAlthough Esperanto is not a country, there is an [[Esperanto football team]], which has existed since 2014 and participates in matches during [[World Esperanto Congress]]es.<ref>{{eo}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9UkAf7Tm8U Intervjuo de Osmo Buller (Gxenerala Direktoro de UEA) pri la futbalmatcxo dum la 99a UK]</ref> The team is part of the [[N.F.-Board]] and not of [[FIFA]], and have played against the teams of Armenian-originating Argentine Community in 2014 and the team from [[Western Sahara]] in 2015.\n\n=== Esperanto speakers and Esperantists ===\n\n{{Further information|Native Esperanto speakers}}\n{{See also|World Esperanto Congress|International Youth Congress of Esperanto}}\nInitially, Esperanto speakers learned the language as it was described by [[L. L. Zamenhof]].<ref>The book ''Lingvaj respondoj de Ludoviko'' (Eldonejo Ludovikito, 1990, 7-a eld.) contains about 120 pages of answers of Zamenhof to questions of Esperanto learners between 1887 and 1912.</ref> In 1905 the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' put together the first Esperanto textbook, an exercise book and a universal dictionary.<ref>The speech of Zamenhof during the 8th [[Universala Kongreso de Esperanto]] in [[Krakow|Krakovo]] (1912)shows that he does not want to take part in the language community as the \u201cMajstro\u201d.</ref>\n\nThe [[Declaration of Boulogne|\"Declaration about the essence of Esperantism\"]] (1905) defines an \"Esperantisto\" to be anyone who speaks and uses Esperanto.<ref>''UEA en konscio de Esperantistoj'', Zbigniew Galor and Jukka Pietil\u00e4inen, Kava-Pech, 2015, p. 14</ref> \"Esperantism\" was defined to be a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to natural languages in international and inter-ethnic contexts. As the word \"esperantist\" is linked with this \"esperantism\" (the [[Esperanto movement]]) and as -ists and -isms are linked with ideologies, today many people who speak Esperanto prefer to be called \"Esperanto speaker\".\n\nThe monthly magazine ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'' every year since 1998 proclaims an 'Esperantist of the year', who remarkably contributed to the spreading of the language during the year.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Businesses ===\nPublishing and selling books, the so-called book services, is the main market and is often the first expenditure of many Esperanto associations. Some companies are already well known: for example [[Vinilkosmo]], which publishes and makes popular Esperanto music since 1990. Then there are initiatives such as the job-seeking website ''[[Eklaboru]]'', created by [[Chuck Smith (Esperantist)|Chuck Smith]], for job offers and candidates within Esperanto associations or Esperanto meetings.\n\n=== Currency ===\n{{Main article|Stelo}}\nIn 1907, [[Ren\u00e9 de Saussure]] proposed the [[spesmilo]] \u27e8\u20b7\u27e9 as an international currency.\nIt had some use before the First World War.\nThe currency [[Stelo]] was created in 1942 and has been used at meetings of the ''[[Universala Ligo]]'' and in Esperanto environments. Over the years it slowly became unusable and at the official closing of the Universala Ligo in the 1990s, the remaining star-coins were handed over to the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]. You can buy them at the UEA's book service as souvenirs.\n\nThe current ''steloj'' are made of plastic, they are used in a number of meetings, especially among young people. The currency is maintained by Stelaro, which calculates the rates, keeps the stock, and opened branches in various e-meetings. Currently there are ''stelo''-coins of 1 \u2605, 3 \u2605 and 10 \u2605. Quotes of Stars at 31 December 2014 were [25] 1 EUR = 4.189 \u2605.<ref>[http://stelaro.alesk.eu/ Kurzoj]</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main article|Esperanto culture}}\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n[[File:A\u016dstrio-Vieno-Zamenhof-monumento-2.jpg|thumb|right|L. L. Zamenhof [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] in the [[Esperantopark]] in [[Vienna]]]]\nThere exist [[Zamenhof-Esperanto object]]s (ZEOs), scattered in numerous countries around the world, which are the things named in honor of [[L. L. Zamenhof]] or Esperanto: monuments, street names, places and so on. There also exists a [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]-committee for ZEOs.<ref>[http://www.uea.org/asocio/komisionoj/zeoj \u201cZamenhof/Esperanto-objektoj (ZEO-j)\u201d en la retejo de UEA]</ref>\n\nIn addition, in several countries there are also sites dedicated to Esperanto: meetup places, workshops, seminars, festivals, Esperanto houses. These places provide attractions for Esperantists. Here are two: the [[Castle of Gr\u00e9silion]] in [[France]] and the [[Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum]] in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).\n\n=== Cultural heritage ===\n[[File:2008-07-19 kd-oj en uk-ls.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Music in Esperanto]]\n{{main article|Esperanto literature}}\nEsperanto literary heritage is the richest and the most diverse of any constructed language. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed [[List of Esperanto magazines|Esperanto magazines]].\n\nThere is also a [[List of Esperanto-language films|number of movies]], which have been published in Esperanto. Moreover, Esperanto itself was used in numerous movies.\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nMany public holidays recognized by Esperanto speakers are celebrated international and already accepted in other countries and organizations such as [[UN]] or [[UNESCO]]. Here are the celebrations internationally proposed by the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] since 2010:\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Meaning, purpose, anniversary\n|-\n| February 21\n| [[International Mother Language Day]]\n| Saving cultural diversity and multilingualism\n|-\n| last full week of February\n| [[Week of International Friendship]]\n| Strengthening mutual contacts and sense.\n|-\n| April 14\n| Memorial Day of all Pioneers\n| Anniversary of the death of [[L.

They mobilize Esperanto-speakers which share the same will about a specific topic. The main example is the [[Universal Congress of Esperanto]] (UK), which annually organizes the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] every summer for a week. Other events:\n* [[SAT-Kongreso]], annually organised by [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]];\n* [[International Youth Congress of Esperanto]] (IJK), official annual congress of [[TEJO]];\n* [[Internacia Infana Kongreseto]] (IIK), arrangement for children between 6 and 16 years that occur simultaneously with and close to the Universal Congress of Esperanto;\n* [[Somera Esperanto-Studado]] (SES), the largest international Esperanto meeting aimed at learning of Esperanto.\n\nNext to these globally comprising meetings there are also local events such as [[Novjara Renkonti\u011do|New Year's Gathering]] (NR) or [[Esperanto Youth Week]] (JES), which occur during the last days of December and first days of January. These meetings seem to have been successful during the last 20 years.\n\nDue to the fact that there are a lot of Esperanto meetings around the globe, there are two websites which aim to list and share them. [http://eventoj.hu/ Eventoj.hu] describes them with a list and dates, and contains an archive until 1996, while [http://esperant.io/ Esperant.io] offers world map with the locations of future meetings.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Esperanto]]", "sha1": "43x0chllfnrk1wcwz5zc7m1ixvkgdki"}}, {"title": "Ethernet", "ns": "0", "id": "9499", "revision": {"id": "866631182", "parentid": "866631152", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T14:56:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jebcubed", "id": "33351428"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/2A01:4B00:8873:2800:8D29:85AA:3190:D1AB|2A01:4B00:8873:2800:8D29:85AA:3190:D1AB]] ([[User talk:2A01:4B00:8873:2800:8D29:85AA:3190:D1AB|talk]]) to last revision by Frietjes.

Ethernet establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses.

A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection]] (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing Token Ring or [[Token Bus]] technologies.{{Efn|In a CSMA/CD system packets must be large enough to guarantee that the leading edge of the propagating wave of a message gets to all parts of the medium and back again before the transmitter stops transmitting, guaranteeing that [[collisions]] (two or more packets initiated within a window of time that forced them to overlap) are discovered. As a result, the minimum packet size and the physical medium's total length are closely linked.}} Computers are connected to an [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) [[transceiver]], which is in turn connected to the cable (with [[thin Ethernet]] the transceiver is integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.{{Efn|Multipoint systems are also prone to strange failure modes when an electrical discontinuity reflects the signal in such a manner that some nodes would work properly, while others work slowly because of excessive retries or not at all.

This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.\n\nDespite the physical star topology and the presence of separate transmit and receive channels in the twisted pair and fiber media, repeater-based Ethernet networks still use half-duplex and CSMA/CD, with only minimal activity by the repeater, primarily generation of the [[jam signal]] in dealing with packet collisions. Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Bridging and switching}} ===<!--[[Full-duplex Ethernet]] links here-->\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--most paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Network switches.jpg|thumb|[[Patch cable]]s with [[patch field]]s of two Ethernet switches]]\n{{Main|Network switch|Bridging (networking)|}}\nWhile repeaters can isolate some aspects of [[Ethernet segment]]s, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. This creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. The entire network is one [[collision domain]], and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.\n\nTo alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges (and switches) work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. [[broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to deployment of Fast Ethernet.\n\nIn 1989, the networking company [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]] (acquired by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco Systems, Inc.]] in 1994) introduced their EtherSwitch, the first Ethernet switch.{{Efn|The term ''switch'' was invented by device manufacturers and does not appear in the 802.3 standard.}} This works somewhat differently from an Ethernet bridge, where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment.  This greatly reduces the forwarding latency and the processing load on the network device. One drawback of this [[cut-through switching]] method is that packets that have been corrupted are still propagated through the network, so a [[#Jabber|jabbering]] station can continue to disrupt the entire network.  The eventual remedy for this was a return to the original [[store and forward]] approach of bridging, where the packet would be read into a buffer on the switch in its entirety, verified against its checksum and then forwarded, but using more powerful [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s. Hence, the bridging is then done in hardware, allowing packets to be forwarded at full wire speed.\n\nWhen a twisted pair or fiber link segment is used and neither end is connected to a repeater, [[full-duplex]] Ethernet becomes possible over that segment.  In full-duplex mode, both devices can transmit and receive to and from each other at the same time, and there is no collision domain.  This doubles the aggregate bandwidth of the link and is sometimes advertised as double the link speed (for example, 200&nbsp;Mbit/s).{{Efn|This is misleading, as performance will double only if traffic patterns are symmetrical.}} The elimination of the collision domain for these connections also means that all the link's bandwidth can be used by the two devices on that segment and that segment length is not limited by the need for correct collision detection.\n\nSince packets are typically delivered only to the port they are intended for, traffic on a switched Ethernet is less public than on shared-medium Ethernet. <span id=\"switch_vulnerabilities\">Despite this, switched Ethernet should still be regarded as an insecure network technology, because it is easy to subvert switched Ethernet systems by means such as [[ARP spoofing]] and [[MAC flooding]].</span>\n\nThe bandwidth advantages, the improved isolation of devices from each other, the ability to easily mix different speeds of devices and the elimination of the chaining limits inherent in non-switched Ethernet have made switched Ethernet the dominant network technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns394/ns74/ns149/net_business_benefit09186a00800c92b9_ps6600_Products_White_Paper.html |quote=Respondents were first asked about their current and planned desktop LAN attachment standards.

All three use twisted pair cables and [[8P8C modular connector]]s. They run at {{nowrap|10 Mbit/s}}, {{nowrap|100 Mbit/s}}, and {{nowrap|1 Gbit/s}}, respectively. [[Optical fiber|Fiber optic]] variants of Ethernet are also very common in larger networks, offering high performance, better electrical isolation and longer distance (tens of kilometers with some versions). In general, network [[protocol stack]] software will work similarly on all varieties.\n\n==Frame structure==\n[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded Ethernet chip.]]\n{{Main|Ethernet frame}}\nIn IEEE 802.3, a [[datagram]] is called a ''packet'' or ''frame''. ''Packet'' is used to describe the overall transmission unit and includes the [[preamble (communication)|preamble]], [[start frame delimiter]] (SFD) and carrier extension (if present).{{Efn|The carrier extension is defined to assist collision detection on shared-media gigabit Ethernet.}} The ''frame'' begins after the start frame delimiter with a frame header featuring source and destination MAC addresses and the EtherType field giving either the protocol type for the payload protocol or the length of the payload. The middle section of the frame consists of payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a 32-bit [[cyclic redundancy check]], which is used to detect corruption of [[data in transit]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.3-2012.html\n| title = 802.3-2012 \u2013 IEEE Standard for Ethernet\n| date = 2012-12-28 | access-date = 2014-02-08\n| publisher = IEEE Standards Association | work = ieee.org\n| format = PDF\n}}</ref>{{rp|sections 3.1.1 and 3.2}} Notably, Ethernet packets have no [[hop count|time-to-live field]], leading to possible problems in the presence of a switching loop.\n\n==Autonegotiation==\n{{Main|Autonegotiation}}\nAutonegotiation is the procedure by which two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, e.g. speed and duplex mode.

In 1912, his father died suddenly, and his mother moved with their children first to [[Lausanne]], then [[Vienna]] in the same year. They lived in Vienna from the time Canetti was aged seven onwards. His mother insisted that he speak German, and taught it to him. By this time Canetti already spoke [[Judezmo|Ladino]] (his native language), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], English, and some French; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in Britain. Subsequently the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to [[Z\u00fcrich]] and then (until 1924) to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where Canetti graduated from high school.\n\nCanetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature. Introduced into the literary circles of [[First Austrian Republic|First-Republic]]-[[Vienna]], he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the [[July Revolt of 1927]] \u2013 he came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings), and left the place quickly with his bicycle.<ref>Stieg, Gerard, ''Fruits de Feu - l'incendie du Palais du Justice de Vienne en 1927 et ses consequences dans la Litt\u00e9rature Autrichienne''.

He reflected the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in his novel ''Die Blendung'' (''[[Auto-da-F\u00e9 (novel)|Auto-da-F\u00e9]]'', 1935) and non-fiction ''[[Crowds and Power]]'' (1960).

He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss [[Vienna]]: ''Die Gerettete Zunge'' (The Tongue Set Free); ''Die Fackel im Ohr'' (The Torch in My Ear), and ''Das Augenspiel'' (The Play of the Eyes); for his modernist novel ''[[Auto-da-F\u00e9 (novel)|Auto-da-F\u00e9]]'' (''Die Blendung''); and for ''[[Crowds and Power]]'', a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations. \n\nIn the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years.

It is written by about 100&nbsp;full-time editors and more than 4,000&nbsp;contributors, who have included 110 [[Nobel Prize]] winners and five [[President of the United States|American presidents]]. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes<ref name=\"nytstop\" /> and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition; digital content and distribution has continued since then.\n\nThe ''Britannica'' is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia/encyclopedia still in production. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] capital of [[Edinburgh]], as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801\u20131810) it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875\u20131889) and [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th editions]] (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the ''Britannica'' shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the [[North America]]n market. In 1933, the ''Britannica'' became the first encyclopaedia to adopt \"continuous revision\", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.\n\nThe 15th edition has a three-part structure: a 12-volume {{lang|la|[[Microp\u00e6dia]]}} of short articles (generally fewer than 750&nbsp;words), a 17-volume {{lang|la|[[Macrop\u00e6dia]]}} of long articles (two to 310&nbsp;pages), and a single {{lang|la|[[Prop\u00e6dia]]}} volume to give a [[hierarchical]] outline of knowledge. The {{lang|la|Microp\u00e6dia}} is meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the {{lang|la|Macrop\u00e6dia}}; readers are advised to study the {{lang|la|Prop\u00e6dia}} outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the ''Britannica'' has remained steady, with about 40&nbsp;million words on half a million topics. Though published in the [[United States]] since 1901, the ''Britannica'' has for the most part maintained [[American and British English spelling differences|British English spelling]].\n\n== Present status ==\n=== Print version ===\n[[File:Encyclopaedia Britannica 15 with 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|15th edition of the ''Britannica''. The initial volume with the green spine is the {{lang|la|[[Prop\u00e6dia]]}}; the red-spined and black-spined volumes are the {{lang|la|[[Microp\u00e6dia]]}} and the {{lang|la|[[Macrop\u00e6dia]]}}, respectively. The last three volumes are the 2002 Book of the Year (black spine) and the two-volume index (cyan spine).]]\nSince 1985, the ''Britannica'' has had four parts: the {{lang|la|[[Microp\u00e6dia]]}}, the {{lang|la|[[Macrop\u00e6dia]]}}, the {{lang|la|[[Prop\u00e6dia]]}}, and a two-volume index. The ''Britannica'''s articles are found in the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macrop\u00e6dia}}, which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 {{lang|la|Macrop\u00e6dia}} has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors.

In the 20th century, successful competitors included ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'', the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', and the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the ''Britannica'' was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia,<ref name=\"thomas_1992\" /> especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors.<ref name=\"kister_1994\" /><ref name=\"sader_1995\" /> The print version of the ''Britannica'' was significantly more expensive than its competitors.<ref name=\"kister_1994\" /><ref name=\"sader_1995\" />\n\nSince the early 1990s, the ''Britannica'' has faced new challenges from digital information sources.

Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974\u20131985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, [[military decoration]]s, and the French poet [[Joachim du Bellay]]; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies.<ref name=\"Newsweek_1974\" /> Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the {{lang|la|[[Microp\u00e6dia]]}} and {{lang|la|[[Macrop\u00e6dia]]}}.<ref name=\"kister_1994\" /><ref name=\"15th_criticism\" /> Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a \"qualified failure...&#91;that&#93; cares more for juggling its format than for preserving.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek_1974\">{{cite journal | last = Prescott | first = Peter S. | title = The Fifteenth Britannica | journal = Newsweek | date = 8 July 1974 | pages = 71\u201372}}</ref> More recently, reviewers from the [[American Library Association]] were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 {{lang|la|Macrop\u00e6dia}}, along with the article on [[psychology]].<ref name=\"library_association_1992\" />\n\nSome very few ''Britannica''-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the ''Britannica's'' early years is the rejection of [[Newtonian gravity]] by [[George Gleig]], the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788\u20131797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the [[fire (classical element)|classical element of fire]].<ref name=\"kogan_1958\" /> The ''Britannica'' has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with [[William Robertson Smith]]'s articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).<ref name=\"kogan_1958\" />\n\n=== Other criticisms ===\n{{See also|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition#Notable commentary on the Eleventh Edition}}\nThe ''Britannica'' has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated.

A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated.

The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.\n\nThroughout history, the ''Britannica'' has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material.<ref name=\"EB_encyclopedia\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257\u2013286}}</ref> In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge.<ref name=\"propedia_preface\">{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Prop\u00e6dia]]}}| pages = 5\u20138| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}</ref> The history of the ''Britannica'' can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organization of the dictionary.\n\n==== 1768\u20131826 ====\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The early 19th-century editions of {{lang|la|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}} included influential, original research such as [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's]] article on Egypt, which included the translation of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] on the [[Rosetta Stone]] (pictured).]]\nIn the first era (1st\u20136th editions, 1768\u20131826), the ''Britannica'' was managed and published by its founders, [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], by [[Archibald Constable]], and by others.

Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably [[Macvey Napier]], others were attracted by the ''Britannica's'' reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.\n\nProduction of the 9th edition was overseen by [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], the first English-born editor-in-chief.

H&E stain]]\nThe endometrium consists of a single layer of [[columnar epithelium]] plus the [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] on which it rests. The stroma is a layer of [[connective tissue]] that varies in thickness according to [[hormonal]] influences. In the [[uterus]], simple [[tubular gland]]s reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply provided by the [[spiral artery|spiral arteries]]. In a woman of reproductive age, two layers of endometrium can be distinguished. These two layers occur only in the endometrium lining the cavity of the uterus, and not in the lining of the [[Fallopian tube]]s.<ref name=histology/><ref name=Guyton2006/>\n* The ''functional layer'' is adjacent to the uterine cavity. This layer is built up after the end of menstruation during the first part of the previous [[menstrual cycle]]. Proliferation is induced by [[estrogen]] (follicular phase of menstrual cycle), and later changes in this layer are engendered by progesterone from the [[corpus luteum]] (luteal phase). It is adapted to provide an optimum environment for the implantation and growth of the [[embryo]]. This layer is completely shed during [[menstruation]].\n* The ''basal layer'', adjacent to the [[myometrium]] and below the functional layer, is not shed at any time during the menstrual cycle. The functional layer develops on top of it.\nIn the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become [[ischaemic]] and die, leading to [[menstruation]].\n\nIt is possible to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle by reference to either the [[Menstrual cycle#Ovarian cycle|ovarian cycle]] or the [[Menstrual cycle#Uterine cycle|uterine cycle]] by observing microscopic differences at each phase\u2014for example in the ovarian cycle:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in the glandular and stromal cells of the endometrial mucosa. The expression of many of these proteins vary depending on the menstrual cycle, for example the [[Progesterone receptor|progestorone receptor]] and [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] both expressed in the proliferative phase, and [[PAEP]] expressed in the secretory phase. Other proteins such as the [[HOXA11|HOX11]] protein that is required for female fertility, is expressed in endometrial stroma cells throughout the menstrual cycle. Certain specific proteins such as the [[Estrogen receptor alpha|estrogen receptor]] are also expressed in other types of female tissue types, such as the [[cervix]], [[fallopian tube]]s, [[Ovary|ovaries]] and [[breast]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zieba|first=Agata|last2=Sj\u00f6stedt|first2=Evelina|last3=Olovsson|first3=Matts|last4=Fagerberg|first4=Linn|last5=Hallstr\u00f6m|first5=Bj\u00f6rn M.|last6=Oskarsson|first6=Linda|last7=Edlund|first7=Karolina|last8=Tolf|first8=Anna|last9=Uhlen|first9=Mathias|date=2015-10-21|title=The Human Endometrium-Specific Proteome Defined by Transcriptomics and Antibody-Based Profiling|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/omi.2015.0115|journal=OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology|volume=19|issue=11|pages=659\u2013668|doi=10.1089/omi.2015.0115}}</ref>\n\n===Microbiome speculation===\nThe uterus and endometrium was for a long time thought to be sterile. The [[cervical mucus plug|cervical plug]] of mucosa was seen to prevent the entry of any [[microorganism]]s ascending from the vagina. In the 1980s this view was challenged when it was shown that uterine infections could arise from weaknesses in the barrier of the cervical plug. Organisms from the vaginal microbiota could enter the uterus during [[uterine contractions]] in the menstrual cycle. Further studies sought to identify microbiota specific to the uterus which would be of help in identifying cases of unsuccessful [[IVF]] and miscarriages. Their findings were seen to be unreliable due to the possibility of cross-contamination in the sampling procedures used. The well-documented presence of ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species, for example, was easily explained by an increase in the vaginal population being able to seep into the cervical mucous.<ref name=\"Baker\"/> Another study highlighted the flaws of the earlier studies including cross-contamination. It was also argued that the evidence from studies using germ-free offspring of [[axenic]] animals (germ-free) clearly showed the sterility of the uterus. The authors concluded that in light of these findings there was no existence of a microbiome.<ref name=\"Microbiome\"/>\n\nThe normal dominance of Lactobacilli in the vagina is seen as a marker for vaginal health. However, in the uterus this much lower population is seen as invasive in a closed environment that is highly regulated by female sex hormones, and that could have unwanted consequences. In studies of endometriosis ''Lactobacillus'' is not the dominant type and there are higher levels of ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' species. Half of the cases of [[bacterial vaginitis]] showed a polymicrobial [[biofilm]] attached to the endometrium.<ref name=\"Baker\"/>\n\n==Function==\nThe endometrium is the innermost layer of ovary (female reproductive organ) and functions as a lining for the uterus, preventing adhesions between the opposed walls of the [[myometrium]], thereby maintaining the patency of the uterine cavity. During the [[menstrual cycle]] or [[estrous cycle]], the endometrium grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. This represents an optimal environment for the [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of a [[blastocyst]] upon its arrival in the uterus. The endometrium is central, echogenic (detectable using ultrasound scanners), and has an average thickness of 6.7&nbsp;mm.\n\nDuring [[pregnancy]], the glands and [[blood vessel]]s in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the [[placenta]], which supplies [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]].\n\n===Cycle===\nThe endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration. Humans, apes, and some other species display the [[menstrual cycle]], whereas most other mammals are subject to an [[estrous cycle]].<ref name=\"Emera\"/> In both cases, the endometrium initially proliferates under the influence of [[estrogen]]. However, once [[ovulation]] occurs, the ovary (specifically the corpus luteum) will produce much larger amounts of [[progesterone]].  This changes the proliferative pattern of the endometrium to a secretory lining. Eventually, the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment for one or more blastocysts.\n\nUpon fertilization, the egg may implant into the uterine wall and provide feedback to the body with [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (HCG). HCG provides continued feedback throughout pregnancy by maintaining the corpus luteum, which will continue its role of releasing progesterone and estrogen. The endometrial lining is either reabsorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). In the latter case, the process of shedding involves the breaking down of the lining, the tearing of small connective blood vessels, and the loss of the tissue and blood that had constituted it through the [[vagina]]. The entire process occurs over a period of several days. Menstruation may be accompanied by a series of uterine contractions; these help expel the menstrual endometrium.\n\nIn case of implantation, however, the endometrial lining is neither absorbed nor shed. Instead, it remains as ''[[decidua]]''. The decidua becomes part of the placenta; it provides support and protection for the gestation.\n\nIf there is inadequate stimulation of the lining, due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans, this will result in [[amenorrhea]], or the absence of a menstrual period. After [[menopause]], the lining is often described as being atrophic.  In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become [[hyperplastic]]. Long-term use of [[oral contraceptives]] with highly potent [[progestin]]s can also induce endometrial [[atrophy]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Deligdisch | first1 = L.\n| title = Effects of hormone therapy on the endometrium\n| journal = Modern Pathology \n| volume = 6\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 94\u2013106\n| year = 1993\n| pmid = 8426860\n}}</ref><ref>William's Gynecology, McGraw 2008, Chapter 8, Abnormal Uterine Bleeding</ref>\n\nIn humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining lasts an average of 28 days. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Various factors including the seasons, climate, and stress can affect its development. The endometrium itself produces certain [[hormone]]s at different stages of the cycle and this affects other parts of the [[reproductive system]].\n\n==Diseases related with endometrium==\n[[Chorionic tissue]] can result in marked endometrial changes, known as an [[Arias-Stella reaction]], that have an appearance similar to [[cancer]].<ref name=pmid11756756>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arias-Stella | first1 = J. | title = The Arias-Stella reaction: facts and fancies four decades after. | journal = Adv Anat Pathol | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 12\u201323 |date=Jan 2002 | doi =  10.1097/00125480-200201000-00003| pmid = 11756756 }}</ref>  Historically, this change was diagnosed as [[endometrial cancer]] and it is important only in so far as it should not be misdiagnosed as cancer.\n\n* [[Adenomyosis]] is the growth of the endometrium into the muscle layer of the uterus (the [[myometrium]]).\n* [[Endometriosis]] is the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.\n* [[Endometrial hyperplasia]]\n* [[Endometrial cancer]] is the most common [[cancer]] of the human female genital tract.\n* [[Asherman's syndrome]], also known as intrauterine [[adhesions]] occurs when the basal layer of the endometrium is damaged by instrumentation (e.g., [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]]) or infection (e.g., endometrial [[tuberculosis]]) resulting in endometrial sclerosis and adhesion formation partially or completely obliterating the uterine cavity.\n\nThin endometrium may be defined as an endometrial thickness of less than 8&nbsp;mm.

Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the [[telharmonium]], [[Hammond organ]], and the [[electric guitar]], which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an [[instrument amplifier]] and speaker cabinet. Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the [[theremin]], [[synthesizer]], and [[computer music|computer]] can produce electronic sounds.<ref name=\"holmes1\">Electroacoustic music may also use electronic [[effect unit]]s to change sounds from the natural world, such as the sound of waves on a beach or bird calls. All types of sounds can be used as source material for this music. Electroacoustic performers and composers use microphones, tape recorders and digital samplers to make live or recorded music. During live performances, natural sounds are modified in real time using electronic effects and [[audio console]]s. The source of the sound can be anything from ambient noise (traffic, people talking) and nature sounds to live musicians playing conventional acoustic or electro-acoustic instruments ({{harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=8}}).</ref>\n\nThe first electronic devices for performing music were developed at the end of the 19th century, and shortly afterward Italian [[Futurism|futurists]] explored sounds that had not been considered musical. During the 1920s and 1930s, electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions for electronic instruments were made. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of [[electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] [[tape music]] in the 1940s, in Egypt and France. [[Musique concr\u00e8te]], created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s. An important new development was the advent of computers to compose music. [[Algorithm]]ic composition was first demonstrated in Australia in 1951.\n\nIn the 1960s, live electronics were pioneered in America and Europe, Japanese electronic musical instruments began influencing the [[music industry]], and Jamaican [[dub music]] emerged as a form of popular electronic music. In the early 1970s, the [[Monophonic synthesizer|monophonic]] [[Minimoog]] synthesizer and Japanese [[drum machine]]s helped popularize synthesized electronic music.\n\nIn the 1970s, electronic music began having a significant influence on [[popular music]], with the adoption of [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s, [[electronic drum]]s, drum machines, and [[Turntablism|turntables]], through the emergence of genres such as [[disco]], [[krautrock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[synth-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]. In the 1980s, electronic music became more dominant in popular music, with a greater reliance on synthesizers, and the adoption of programmable drum machines such as the [[Roland TR-808]] and [[bass synthesizer]]s such as the [[TB-303]]. In the early 1980s, [[Digital technology|digital technologies]] for synthesizers including [[digital synthesizer]]s such as the [[Yamaha DX7]] were popularized, and a group of musicians and music merchants developed the Musical Instrument Digital Interface ([[MIDI]]).\n\nElectronically produced music became prevalent in the popular domain by the 1990s, because of the advent of affordable music technology.<ref>\"Electronically produced music is part of the mainstream of popular culture. Musical concepts that were once considered radical&mdash;the use of environmental sounds, ambient music, turntable music, digital sampling, computer music, the electronic modification of acoustic sounds, and music made from fragments of speech-have now been subsumed by many kinds of popular music. Record store genres including new age, rap, hip-hop, electronica, techno, jazz, and popular song all rely heavily on production values and techniques that originated with classic electronic music\" ({{harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=1}}). \"By the 1990s, electronic music had penetrated every corner of musical life. It extended from ethereal sound-waves played by esoteric experimenters to the thumping syncopation that accompanies every pop record\" ({{harvnb|Lebrecht|1996|p=106}}).</ref> <!-- following paragraph and citation questionable: Today, the term electronic music serves to differentiate music that uses electronics as its focal point or inspiration, from music that uses electronics mainly in service of creating an intended production that may have some electronic elements in the sound but does not focus upon them.<ref name=\"holmes2\">\"Purely electronic music is created through the generation of sound waves by electrical means. This is done without the use of traditional musical instruments or of sounds found in nature, and is the domain of computers, synthesizers and other technologies\" {{harv|Holmes|2002|loc=6}}.</ref> --> Contemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from [[Experimental music|experimental art music]] to popular forms such as [[electronic dance music]].

[[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Ernst Toch]] composed several pieces in 1930 by layering recordings of instruments and vocals at adjusted speeds. Influenced by these techniques, [[John Cage]] composed ''[[Imaginary Landscape No. 1]]'' in 1939 by adjusting the speeds of recorded tones.<ref name=\"holmes_46\">{{harvnb|Holmes|4th Edition|p=46}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently, composers began to experiment with newly developed [[sound-on-film]] technology. Recordings could be spliced together to create [[sound collage]]s, such as those by [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Walter Ruttmann]] and [[Dziga Vertov]]. Further, the technology allowed sound to be [[graphical sound|graphically created and modified]]. These techniques were used to compose soundtracks for several films in Germany and Russia, in addition to the popular ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' in the United States. Experiments with graphical sound were continued by [[Norman McLaren]] from the late 1930s.\n\n==Development: 1940s to 1950s==\n\n=== Electroacoustic tape music ===\n{{Further|Electroacoustic music|Sound recording and reproduction}}\n\nThe first practical audio [[tape recorder]] was unveiled in 1935.<ref>{{harvnb|Anonymous|2006}}.</ref> Improvements to the technology were made using the [[AC bias]]ing technique, which significantly improved recording fidelity.<ref name=\"engel-weber\">{{harvnb|Engel|2006|pp=4 and 7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Krause|2002}} [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=11304 abstract].</ref> As early as 1942, test recordings were being made in [[stereo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Engel|Hammar|2006|p=6}}.</ref> Although these developments were initially confined to Germany, recorders and tapes were brought to the United States following the end of World War II.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|2006}}, [http://www.scu.edu/scm/summer2006/sound.cfm scu.edu]</ref> These were the basis for the first commercially produced tape recorder in 1948.<ref>{{harvnb|Angus|1984}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, prior to the use of magnetic tape for compositional purposes, Egyptian composer [[Halim El-Dabh]], while still a student in [[Cairo]], used a cumbersome [[Wire recording|wire recorder]] to record sounds of an ancient ''[[Z\u0101r|zaar]]'' ceremony. Using facilities at the Middle East Radio studios El-Dabh processed the recorded material using reverberation, echo, voltage controls, and re-recording.

In the late 1940s, experiments in sound based composition using [[shellac]] record players were first conducted by Schaeffer. In 1950, the techniques of musique concrete were expanded when magnetic tape machines were used to explore sound manipulation practices such as speed variation ([[pitch shift]]) and [[tape splicing]] {{harv|Palombini|1993|loc=14}}.<ref name=\"lebrecht1\">\"Musique Concrete was created in Paris in 1948 from edited collages of everyday noise\" ({{harvnb|Lebrecht|1996|p=107}}).</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1948, RDF broadcast Schaeffer's ''Etude aux chemins de fer''.

Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting [[lathe]], four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, [[Pierre Henry]] began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], began work on ''[[D\u00e9serts]]'', a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.\n\nIn 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concr\u00e8te at the [[\u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris]]. \"Schaeffer used a [[Public address system|PA system]], several turntables, and mixers. The performance did not go well, as creating live montages with turntables had never been done before.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Snyder|n.d.}}</ref> Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on ''Symphonie pour un homme seul'' (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, ''Orpheus'', for concrete sounds and voices.\n\n===Elektronische Musik===\n[[File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|Karlheinz Stockhausen in the Electronic Music Studio of WDR, Cologne, in 1991]]\n[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] worked briefly in Schaeffer's studio in 1952, and afterward for many years at the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] Cologne's [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music]].\n\nIn Cologne, what would become the most famous electronic music studio in the world was officially opened at the radio studios of the [[NWDR]] in 1953, though it had been in the planning stages as early as 1950 and early compositions were made and broadcast in 1951.<ref>{{harvnb|Eimert|1972|p=349}}.</ref> The brain child of [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]], Robert Beyer, and [[Herbert Eimert]] (who became its first director), the studio was soon joined by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]]. In his 1949 thesis ''Elektronische Klangerzeugung: Elektronische Musik und Synthetische Sprache'', Meyer-Eppler conceived the idea to synthesize music entirely from electronically produced signals; in this way, ''elektronische Musik'' was sharply differentiated from French ''musique concr\u00e8te'', which used sounds recorded from acoustical sources.<ref>{{harvnb|Eimert|1958|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Ungeheuer|1992|p=117}}.</ref>\n\n\"With Stockhausen and [[Mauricio Kagel]] in residence, it became a year-round hive of charismatic avante-gardism {{sic}}\"<ref>({{harvnb|Lebrecht|1996|p=75}}). \"... at Northwest German Radio in Cologne (1953), where the term 'electronic music' was coined to distinguish their pure experiments from musique concrete...\" (Lebrecht 1996, 107).</ref> on two occasions combining electronically generated sounds with relatively conventional [[orchestra]]s&mdash;in ''[[Mixtur]]'' (1964) and ''[[Hymnen|Hymnen, dritte Region mit Orchester]]'' (1967).<ref>{{harvnb|Stockhausen|1978|pp=73&ndash;76, 78&ndash;79}}</ref> Stockhausen stated that his listeners had told him his electronic music gave them an experience of \"outer space\", sensations of flying, or being in a \"fantastic dream world\".<ref>\"In 1967, just following the world premiere of ''[[Hymnen]]'', Stockhausen said about the electronic music experience: '... Many listeners have projected that strange new music which they experienced&mdash;especially in the realm of electronic music&mdash;into extraterrestrial space. Even though they are not familiar with it through human experience, they identify it with the fantastic dream world. Several have commented that my electronic music sounds \"like on a different star\", or \"like in outer space.\" Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space. Thus, extreme words are employed to describe such experience, which are not \"objectively\" communicable in the sense of an object description, but rather which exist in the subjective fantasy and which are projected into the extraterrestrial space'\" ({{harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=145}}).</ref>\nMore recently, Stockhausen turned to producing electronic music in his own studio in [[K\u00fcrten]], his last work in the medium being ''[[Cosmic Pulses]]'' (2007).\n\n===Japanese electronic music===\n{{Confusing section|date=March 2012}}\n{{multiple image |direction=horizontal |align=right\n | image1 = Yamaha Magna Organ (1935) Console.jpg |width1=114\n | image2 = Yamaha Magna Organ (1935) Tone Cabinet.jpg |width2=102\n | footer = [[List of Yamaha products#Magna Organ|Yamaha Magna Organ]] and the designated tone cabinet (1935)<ref name=Yamaha1935/>\n}}\n\nThe earliest group of electronic musical instruments in Japan, [[List of Yamaha products#Magna Organ|Yamaha Magna Organ]] was built in 1935,<ref name=Yamaha1935>\n\tBefore the Second World War in Japan, several \"electrical\" instruments seem already to have been developed (''see [[:ja:\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u697d#\u9ece\u660e\u671f]]''), and in 1935 a kind of \"''electronic''\" musical instrument, the [[List of Yamaha products#Magna Organ|Yamaha Magna Organ]], was developed.

In 1955, more experimental and electronic studios began to appear. Notable were the creation of the [[Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano]], a studio at the [[NHK]] in [[Tokyo]] founded by [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]], and the Philips studio at [[Eindhoven]], the [[Netherlands]], which moved to the [[University of Utrecht]] as the [[Institute of Sonology]] in 1960.\n\nThe score for ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]],<ref name=\"norman2\">\"From at least Louis and Bebbe Barron's soundtrack for ''The Forbidden Planet'' onwards, electronic music\u2014in particular synthetic timbre\u2014has impersonated alien worlds in film\" ({{harvnb|Norman|2004|p=32}}).</ref> was entirely composed using custom built electronic circuits and tape recorders in 1956.\n\nThe world's first computer to play music was [[CSIRAC]], which was designed and built by [[Trevor Pearcey]] and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the [[Colonel Bogey March]], of which no known recordings exist, only the accurate reconstruction.<ref>{{harvnb|Doornbusch|2005|p=25}}.</ref> However, [[CSIRAC]] played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice.

[[Lejaren Hiller]] and Leonard Isaacson composed ''[[Illiac Suite]]'' for [[string quartet]], the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using [[algorithm]]ic composition. \"...

[[Vocoder]] technology was also a major development in this early era. In 1956, Stockhausen composed ''[[Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge]]'', the first major work of the [[Cologne]] studio, based on a text from the ''[[Book of Daniel]]''. An important technological development of that year was the invention of the [[Clavivox]] [[synthesizer]] by [[Raymond Scott]] with subassembly by [[Robert Moog]].\n\nAlso in 1957, Kid Baltan ([[Dick Raaymakers]]) and [[Tom Dissevelt]] released their debut album, ''Song Of The Second Moon'', recorded at the Philips studio in the Netherlands.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|n.d.}}</ref> The public remained interested in the new sounds being created around the world, as can be deduced by the inclusion of Var\u00e8se's ''[[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'', which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 [[Expo 58|Brussels World Fair]]. That same year, [[Mauricio Kagel]], an [[Argentina|Argentine]] composer, composed ''Transici\u00f3n II''. The work was realized at the WDR studio in Cologne. Two musicians performed on a piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings, frame, and case. Two other performers used tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.\n\n==Expansion: 1960s==\n\n[[File:Dick Mills, BBC Radiophonic Workshop at the Roundhouse, 2009-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dick Mills]], <br/>[[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] (2009)]]\n{{See also|Synthesizer|Harald Bode|Modular synthesizer|Buchla|Moog Music}}\n\nThese were fertile years for electronic music&mdash;not just for academia, but for independent artists as [[synthesizer]] technology became more accessible. By this time, a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing. 1960 witnessed the composition of Luening's ''[[Gargoyle]]s'' for violin and tape as well as the premiere of Stockhausen's ''[[Kontakte]]'' for electronic sounds, piano, and percussion. This piece existed in two versions&mdash;one for 4-channel tape, and the other for tape with human performers. \"In ''Kontakte'', Stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax.

A major challenge was finding the right software constructs to support highly sensitive and responsive accompaniment. All of this was pre-MIDI, but the results were impressive even though heavy doses of tempo rubato would continually surprise my '''Synthetic Performer'''. In 1985 we solved the tempo rubato problem by incorporating ''learning from rehearsals'' (each time you played this way the machine would get better). We were also now tracking violin, since our brilliant, young flautist had contracted a fatal cancer.

STEIM has existed since 1969. It was founded by [[Misha Mengelberg]], [[Louis Andriessen]], [[Peter Schat]], [[Dick Raaymakers]], {{ill|Jan van Vlijmen|nl|Jan van Vlijmen|vertical-align=sup}}, [[Reinbert de Leeuw]], and [[Konrad Boehmer]]. This group of Dutch composers had fought for the reformation of Amsterdam's feudal music structures; they insisted on Bruno Maderna's appointment as musical director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and enforced the first public fundings for experimental and improvised electronic music in The Netherlands.\n\n{{ill|Elektronmusikstudion|sv}} (EMS), formerly known as Electroacoustic Music in Sweden, is the Swedish national centre for electronic music and [[sound art]]. The research organisation started in 1964 and is based in Stockholm.\n\n===Birth of MIDI===\n{{Main|MIDI}}\nIn 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument Digital Interface ([[MIDI]]) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially [[Sequential Circuits]], [[Oberheim Electronics|Oberheim]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]\u2014and later, other participants that included [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Korg]], and [[Kawai (company)|Kawai]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2008|p=227}}.</ref> A paper was authored by [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]] of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the [[Audio Engineering Society]] in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.\n\nMIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.\n\nMIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and sampled-ROM-based instruments.\n\n[[Miller Puckette]] developed graphic signal-processing software for [[Sogitec 4X|4X]] called [[Max (software)|Max]] (after [[Max Mathews]]) and later ported it to [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] (with Dave Zicarelli extending it for [[Opcode Systems|Opcode]])<ref>{{harvnb|Ozab|2000}} [http://www.atpm.com/6.05/barline.shtml].</ref> for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.\n\n===Sequencers and drum machines===\n{{Main|Music sequencer|Drum machine}} {{Disputed|section|date=December 2011}}\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of [[bass synthesizer]]s, the most influential being the [[Roland TB-303]], a bass synthesizer and [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] released in late 1981 that later became a fixture in [[electronic dance music]],<ref>{{harvnb|Vine|2011}}.</ref> particularly [[acid house]].<ref name=\"guardian_2011\"/> One of the first to use it was [[Charanjit Singh (musician)|Charanjit Singh]] in 1982, though it wouldn't be popularized until [[Phuture]]'s \"[[Acid Tracks]]\" in 1987.<ref name=\"guardian_2011\">{{harvnb|Aitken|2011}}.</ref> [[Music sequencer]]s began being used around the mid 20th century, and Tomita's albums in mid-1970s being later examples.<ref name=\"jenkins_2007\">{{harvnb|Jenkins|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c3EHIpo0DKwC&pg=PA133 133&ndash;34]}}</ref> In 1978, Yellow Magic Orchestra were using [[computer]]-based technology in conjunction with a synthesiser to produce popular music,<ref name=\"billboard_1979\">{{harvnb|Anonymous|1979}}.</ref> making their early use of the [[microprocessor]]-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer]] sequencer.<ref name=\"discogs_ymo_lp\">{{Discogs release|453067|Yellow Magic Orchestra &ndash; Yellow Magic Orchestra}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=1981 |title=Sound International |journal=Sound International |issue=33&ndash;40 |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sj5LAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=21 June 2011}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2011}}<!--None of the following terms produce any result at the linked item: \"yellow\", \"\"magic\", \"orchestra\", \"MC-8\", \"microcomposer\", \"sequencer\", \"1978\".-->\n\n[[Drum machine]]s, also known as rhythm machines, also began being used around the late-1950s, with a later example being [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s progressive rock album ''Benzaiten'' (1974), which used a rhythm machine along with [[electronic drum]]s and a synthesizer.<ref name=\"Benzaiten\"/> In 1977, [[Ultravox]]'s \"[[Hiroshima Mon Amour]]\" was one of the first singles to use the [[metronome]]-like [[percussion]] of a [[Roland TR-77]] drum machine.<ref name=\"Maginnis\"/> In 1980, [[Roland Corporation]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], one of the first and most popular programmable [[drum machine]]s.

Max Mathews developed the \"Conductor\" program for real-time tempo, dynamic and timbre control of a pre-input electronic score. [[Morton Subotnick]] released a multimedia CD-ROM ''All My Hummingbirds Have Alibis''.\n\n==2000s and 2010s==\nAs computer technology has become more accessible and [[music software]] has advanced, interacting with music production technology is now possible using means that bear no relationship to traditional [[performance|musical performance]] practices:<ref>{{harvnb|Emmerson|2007|pp=111&ndash;13}}.</ref> for instance, [[laptop computer|laptop]] performance (''[[laptronica]]''),<ref>{{harvnb|Emmerson|2007|pp=80&ndash;81}}.</ref> [[live coding]]<ref>{{harvnb|Emmerson|2007|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Collins|2003}}</ref> and [[Algorave]]. In general, the term [[Live PA]] refers to any live performance of electronic music, whether with laptops, synthesizers, or other devices.\n\nIn the last decade, a number of software-based virtual studio environments have emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's [[Reason (software)|Reason]] and [[Ableton Live]] finding popular appeal.<ref>{{harvnb|Anonymous|2009}}&mdash;Best Audio Editing Software of the Year\u20141st Abelton Live, 4th Reason.

Such advances have democratized music creation,<ref>{{harvnb|Chadabe|2004|pp=5&ndash;6}}.</ref> leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet. Software based instruments and effect units (so called \"plugins\") can be incorporated in a computer-based studio using the VST platform. Some of these instruments are more or less exact replicas of existing hardware (such as the Roland D-50, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha DX7 or Korg M1). In many cases, these software-based instruments are sonically indistinguishable from their physical counterpart.{{Clarify|date=May 2018}}<!--Does \"physical\" mean an acoustic instrument (bassoon, piano, etc.), or a \"hardware\" synth?-->{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nArtists can also individuate their production practice by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as [[Max/Msp]] and [[Reaktor]] and [[open source]] packages such as [[Csound]], [[Pure Data]], [[SuperCollider]], and [[ChucK]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Circuit bending===\n[[File:Bending.jpg|thumb|Probing for \"bends\" using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips]]\n{{See also|#Live electronics}}<!-- A prior section which mentioned beginning of \"Circuit bending\" -->\n[[Circuit bending]] is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low [[voltage]], battery-powered [[guitar effects]], children's [[toy]]s and small digital [[synthesizer]]s to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with [[noise music]], though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with \"bent\" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and [[potentiometer]]s that alter the circuit. With the revived interest for analogue synthesizers, circuit bending became a cheap solution for many experimental musicians to create their own individual analogue sound generators. Nowadays many schematics can be found to build noise generators such as the [[Atari Punk Console]] or the Dub Siren as well as simple modifications for children toys such as the famous [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]]s that are often modified by circuit benders. Reed Ghazala has explored circuit bending with the Speak & Spell toy, and has held apprenticeships and workshops on circuit bending.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-theory.com/ |title=Reed Ghazala's Anti-Theory Workshop |publisher=Anti-theory.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2015|reason=self-published site does describes Ghazala as \"The Father of Circuit-Bending\", but does not say why he is called this; there are ads for workshops and apprenticeships, but no mention of how long these have been offered; \"Speak & Spell\" is nowhere mentioned on the site.}}\n\n===Modular synth revival===\nFollowing the circuit bending culture, musicians also began to build their own modular synthesizers, causing a renewed interest for the early 1960s designs.

He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the [[organ (music)|organ]], which was mandatory for piano students. In the spring of 1860, he survived two life-threatening [[Respiratory disease|lung diseases]], [[pleurisy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure. Grieg was admitted many times to spas and [[Sanatorium|sanatoria]] both in Norway and abroad. Several of his doctors became his personal friends.<ref>Laerum OD.

He met the Danish composers [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann|J. P. E. Hartmann]] and [[Niels Gade]]. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer [[Rikard Nordraak]] (composer of the [[Ja, vi elsker dette landet|Norwegian national anthem]]), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a [[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak|funeral march]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/Edvard_Grieg |title=Edvard Grieg|publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=Rune J.

The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from [[meningitis]]. In the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] while on holiday in Denmark. [[Edmund Neupert]] gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3&nbsp;April 1869 in the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo).<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Nina_Grieg   |title=Nina Grieg\n|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Inger Elisabeth Haavet|accessdate= September  1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, [[Franz Liszt]], who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which led to Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in [[Rome]] in 1870. On Grieg's first visit, they went over Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on [[orchestration]] (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet).<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://www.mnc.net/norway/grieg.htm |title=  Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) |publisher=  Norwegian State Academy of Music in Oslo |author=  Harald Herresthal |accessdate=  September  1, 2017 |deadurl=  yes |archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20051214011056/http://www.mnc.net/norway/GRIEG.HTM |archivedate=  14 December 2005 |df=  dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1874\u201376, Grieg composed [[incidental music]] for the premiere of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', at the request of the author.\n\nGrieg had close ties with the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]] (Harmonien), and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882.

In the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm [[gramophone record]]ings of his piano music in Paris; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and [[Welte-Mignon]] reproducing system, all of which survive today and can be heard. He also worked with the [[Aeolian Company]] for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.\n\nIn 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in [[France]] in protest of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], an anti-semitic scandal that was then roiling French politics. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might, \"Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights.\"  As a result of his position on the affair, he became the target of much French [[hate mail]] of that day.<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/02/27/493382.html Grieg the Humanist Brought to Light] article by ''Dagbladet''</ref> <ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/i-have-no-desire-to-appear-before-a-french-audience-1.47656 I Have No Desire....] Haaretz News.

Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: \u201cI have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\u201d<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger '', Oxford University Press, 1999, P. 133-134.</ref>\n\nEdvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway in the late summer of 1907 at age 64 from [[heart failure]]. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were \"Well, if it must be so.\"\n\nThe funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him. Following his wish, his own ''[[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak]]'' was played in an orchestration by his friend [[Johan Halvorsen]], who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the ''Funeral March'' movement from [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] was played. Grieg was cremated, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, [[Troldhaugen]].

The music of \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats. The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain.\n\nIn an 1874 letter to his friend [[Frants Beyer]], Grieg expressed his unhappiness with Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter, one of the movements he composed for ''Peer Gynt'', writing \"I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King \u2013 something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Layton\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = Grieg: Illustrated Lives of the Great Composers\n  | publisher=Omnibus Press\n  | year = 1998\n  | pages = 75\n  | isbn = 0-7119-4811-9\n}}  See also: {{cite news\n  | last = Tommasini\n  | first = Anthony\n  | title = Respect at Last for Grieg?\n  | series=Music\n  |work=The New York Times\n  | date = 16 September 2007\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/arts/music/16tomm.html\n  | accessdate =4 July 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nGrieg's ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for [[string instrument|string]] orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], Henrik Ibsen, [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and others. Russian composer [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet.

It changed the federal legal status of more than 3.5 million [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] in the designated areas of [[American South|the South]] from slave to free. As soon as a slave escaped the control of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the former slave became free. Ultimately, the rebel surrender [[Abolitionism#Civil War and final emancipation|liberated]] and resulted in the proclamation's application to all of the designated former slaves.  It did not cover slaves in Union areas that were freed by [[U.S. state|state]] action (or three years later by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]] in December 1865). It was issued as a war measure during the [[American Civil War]], directed to all of the areas in rebellion and all segments of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]] (including the Army and Navy) of the United States.<ref>Political scientist Brian R.

The Proclamation was issued in January 1863 after U.S government issued a series of warnings in the summer of 1862 under the [[Confiscation Acts|Second Confiscation Act]], allowing Southern Confederate supporters 60 days to surrender, or face confiscation of land and slaves. The Proclamation also ordered that suitable persons among those freed could be enrolled into the paid service of United States' forces, and ordered the Union Army (and all segments of the Executive branch) to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of\" the ex-slaves. The Proclamation did not compensate the owners, did not outlaw slavery, and did not grant citizenship to the ex-slaves (called [[Freedman|freedmen]]). It made the eradication of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] an explicit war goal, in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union.<ref>{{harvnb|Foner|2010|pp=239\u201342}}</ref>\n\nAround 25,000 to 75,000 slaves in regions where the US Army was active were immediately emancipated. It could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion, but, as the Union army took control of Confederate regions, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for freeing more than three and a half million slaves in those regions. Prior to the Proclamation, in accordance with the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], escaped slaves were either returned to their masters or held in camps as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] for later return. The Proclamation applied only to slaves in Confederate-held lands; it did not apply to those in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|four slave states]] that were not in rebellion ([[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[Missouri]], which were unnamed), nor to Tennessee (unnamed but occupied by Union troops since 1862) and lower Louisiana (also under occupation), and specifically excluded those counties of [[Virginia]] soon to form the state of [[West Virginia]]. Also specifically excluded (by name) were some regions already controlled by the Union army. Emancipation in those places would come after separate state actions or the December 1865 ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made slavery and [[indentured servitude]], except for those duly convicted of a crime, illegal everywhere subject to United States jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html | title=Amendments to the U.S. Constitution | accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n\nOn September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state that did not end its rebellion against the Union by January 1, 1863.<ref>Louis P. Masur tells the story of the 100-day interval in ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union'' (2012)</ref>  None of the Confederate states restored themselves to the Union, and Lincoln's order was signed and took effect on January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation outraged white Southerners (and their sympathizers) who envisioned a race war. It angered some Northern Democrats, energized anti-slavery forces, and undermined elements in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: vol 6. War Becomes Revolution, 1862\u20131863'' (1960) pp. 231\u201341, 273</ref> The Proclamation lifted the spirits of [[African American]]s both free and slave. It led many slaves to escape from their masters and get to Union lines to obtain their freedom, and to join the Union Army.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation broadened the goals of the Civil War. While slavery had been a major issue that led to the war, Lincoln's only mission at the start of the war was to maintain the Union. The Proclamation made freeing the slaves an explicit goal of the Union war effort. Establishing the abolition of slavery as one of the two primary war goals served to deter intervention by Britain and France.<ref name=\"Howard Jones 1999\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-2582-2}}</ref> The Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U.S., Lincoln pushed for passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], and insisted that [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] plans for Southern states require abolition in new state constitutions. Congress passed the 13th Amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote on January 31, 1865, and it was ratified by the states on December 6, 1865, ending legal slavery.<ref>{{cite web|title=13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==Authority==\n{{Further information|Slave states and free states}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Abraham Lincoln - overall.jpg|thumb|Abraham Lincoln]]\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] of 1787 did not use the word \"slavery\" but included several provisions about unfree persons.

Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time.<ref name=\"Striner\"/> In his 2014 book, ''[[Lincoln's Gamble]]'', journalist and historian [[Todd Brewster]] asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation.

Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, [[Edward Bates]], for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.<ref>{{cite book| last=Brewster| first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War|year=2014|publisher=Scribner|page=236|isbn=978-1451693867}}</ref>\n\nConflicting advice, to free all slaves, or not free them at all, was presented to Lincoln in public and private. [[Thomas Nast]], a cartoon artist during the Civil War and the late 1800s considered \"Father of the American Cartoon\", composed many works including a two-sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after President Lincoln signed the Proclamation.

A delegation headed by [[William W. Patton]] met the president at the [[White House]] on September 13. Lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves.

The final proclamation was issued January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, \"as a necessary war measure\" as the basis of the proclamation, rather than the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment. Some days after issuing the final Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to Major General [[John McClernand]]: \"After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the \"institution\"; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States.

The Proclamation only gave the Lincoln Administration the legal basis to free the slaves in the areas of the South that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. It effectively destroyed slavery as the Union armies advanced south and conquered the entire Confederacy.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 blacks, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war/ |title=Teaching With Documents: The Fight for Equal Rights: Black Soldiers in the Civil War|work=[[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]]}}</ref> Their contributions gave the North additional manpower that was significant in winning the war.

The first part, issued on September 22, 1862, was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the second part, which officially went into effect 100 days later on January 1, 1863, during the second year of the Civil War. It was Abraham Lincoln's declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the Confederacy that had not already returned to federal control by January 1863.

The [[Sea Islands]] off the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free.\n\nSlaves had been part of the \"engine of war\" for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodheart|first=Adam|title=1861: The Civil War Awakening|year=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|location=New York}}</ref> George Washington Albright, a teenage slave in [[Mississippi]], recalled that like many of his fellow slaves, his father escaped to join Union forces.

Writing on the matter after the sack of Fredericksburg, Lee wrote \"In view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy, of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death, if we would save the honor of our families from pollution, our social system from destruction, let every effort be made, every means be employed, to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies, until God, in his mercy, shall bless us with the establishment of our independence.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Civil War, a Narrative: Fredericksburg to Meridian|author=Shelby Foote|volume=Volume 2|year=1963|publisher=Random House}}</ref> Lee's request for a drastic increase of troops would go unfulfilled.\n\n===Political impact===\n[[File:TRUMP.JPG|thumb|\"Abe Lincoln's Last Card; Or, Rouge-et-Noir (Red and Black)\"; ''Punch'', Volume 43, October 18, 1862, p.&nbsp;161.\u2014 a cartoon by the Englishman [[John Tenniel]], after the ''London Times'' stated that Lincoln had played his \"last card\" in issuing the Proclamation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.millikensbend.org/articles-docs/london-times/lt-01-003.html | title=London Times Editorial | date=Oct 6, 1862 | accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/inside.asp?ID=45&subjectID=3 | title=International Reaction}}</ref> Lincoln's hair is in points, suggesting horns.

[[Horatio Seymour]], while running for the governorship of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners, saying it was \"a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe\".<ref name=\"Weber\">{{cite book|title=Copperheads: the rise and fall of Lincoln's opponents in the North|last=Weber|first=Jennifer L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|year=2006|ref=harv}}</ref> The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power. Editor Henry A. Reeves wrote in Greenport's ''Republican Watchman'' that \"In the name of freedom of Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test a utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their Stead.\"<ref name=\"Weber\"/>\n\nRacism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North supported the war only as an effort to force the South to stay in the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery, were now declared lies by their opponents citing the Proclamation. Copperhead David Allen spoke to a rally in Columbiana, Ohio, stating, \"I have told you that this war is carried on for the Negro. There is the proclamation of the President of the United States. Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Brithren<!--quote in cited source uses 'i', not 'e'--> of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Weber|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k4aPFovq9m8C&pg=PA65 65]}}.\n</ref> The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut, H. B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to \"those stupid thick-headed persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution\".<ref name=\"Weber\"/>\n\n[[War Democrats]] who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South, and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.<ref name=\"Weber\"/>\n\nLincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the preliminary copy of the Emancipation Proclamation by [[Habeas corpus in the United States#Presidential suspension of habeas corpus|suspending habeas corpus]]. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.<ref name=\"Weber\"/>\n\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|1862 elections]], the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Lincoln's friend Orville Hickman Browning told the president that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been \"disastrous\" for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Javis of Connecticut pronounced the election the \"beginning of the end of the utter downfall of [[Abolitionism in the United States]]\".<ref name=\"Weber\"/>\n\nHistorians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results looked very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and \"at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party's in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican.... Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate.\"<ref name=\"Weber\"/> McPherson states \"If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln's conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies.\"<ref name=\"Weber\"/>\n\n====Confederate response====\nThe initial Confederate response was one of expected outrage. The Proclamation was seen as vindication for the rebellion, and proof that Lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rebel Message: What Jefferson Davis Has to Say|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX-K12&p_theme=ahnp_k12&p_nbid=E59Q56PUMTMyNTY5MTAwNy4yOTAyNjM6MToxMzozOC4xMDUuOTYuMjM4&p_action=timelinedoc&p_docref=v2:11A050B7B120D3F8@EANX-11AE489CABB99E68@2401523-11AE489CB81982E0@0-11AE489D1F55ED48@The+Rebel+Message.+The+Document+in+Full.+What+Jeff.+Davis+Says+of+President+Lincoln%27s+Emancipation+Proclamation&d_doclabel=The+Rebel+Message%3A+What+Jefferson+Davis+Has+to+Say|work=New York Herald|publisher=America's Historical Newspapers|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> In an August 1863 letter to President Lincoln, U.S. Army general [[Ulysses S.

They were also increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect in November 1864. Slavery in Missouri was ended by executive proclamation of its governor, Thomas C. Fletcher, on January 11, 1865.\n\nWinning re-election, Lincoln pressed the [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], banning slavery in all [[U.S. state]]s and territories. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were about 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.<ref name=\"1860Census\"/>\n\n==Critiques==\n{{further information|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}\nAs the years went on and American life continued to be deeply unfair towards blacks, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. Perhaps the strongest attack was [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett's]] ''[[Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream]]'' (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. In his ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation'', [[Allen C. Guelzo]] noted the professional historians' lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was the US's \"last [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[politician]]\"<ref>{{harvnb|Guelzo|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOFHPTQYqzgC&pg=PA3 3]}}.</ref> and as such was dedicated to removing slavery strictly within the bounds of law.\n\nOther historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished within the tensions of his cabinet and a society at war, for his own growth in political and moral stature, and for the promise he held out to the slaves.<ref>Doris Kearns Goodwin, ''A Team of Rivals'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005</ref> More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As [[Eric Foner]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Lincoln was not an abolitionist or Radical Republican, a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held racist views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027065400/http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |archivedate=2004-10-27 |deadurl=no |title=review of ''Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream'' by Lerone Bennett, Jr. |first=Eric |last=Foner |publisher=Los Angeles Times Book Review |date=April 9, 2000 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKal Ashraf wrote:\n<blockquote>Perhaps in rejecting the critical dualism\u2013Lincoln as individual emancipator pitted against collective self-emancipators\u2013there is an opportunity to recognise the greater persuasiveness of the combination. In a sense, yes: a racist, flawed Lincoln did something heroic, and not in lieu of collective participation, but next to, and enabled, by it. To venerate a singular \u2013Great Emancipator' may be as reductive as dismissing the significance of Lincoln's actions. Who he was as a man, no one of us can ever really know. So it is that the version of Lincoln we keep is also the version we make.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baas.ac.uk/resources/american-studies-in-britain-the-baas-newsletter/ |title=Editorial in American Studies in Britain (108: Spring 2013) iSSN 1465-9956 |first=Kal |last=Ashraf |publisher=British Association for American Studies |date=March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy in the civil rights era==\n\n===Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.===\n[[File:President Barack Obama views the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office 2010-01-18.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] views the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office next to a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]\n\nDr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] made many references to the Emancipation Proclamation during the [[civil rights movement]]. These include a speech made at an observance of the hundredth anniversary of the issuing of the Proclamation made in New York City on September 12, 1962 where he placed it alongside the Declaration of Independence as an \"imperishable\" contribution to civilization, and \"All tyrants, past, present and future, are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations\". He lamented that despite a history where the United States \"proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents\", it \"sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles\". He concluded \"There is but one way to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. That is to make its declarations of freedom real; to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world, and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/anti/historyculture/mlk-ep.htm|title=Dr. Martin Luther King on the Emancipation Proclamation|publisher=National Park Service|author=Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.}}</ref>\n\nKing's most famous invocation of the Emancipation Proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] (often referred to as the \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech). King began the speech saying \"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/i-have-dream|title=I Have A Dream|publisher=The King Center|date=August 28, 1963|author=Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr.}}</ref>\n\n====The \"Second Emancipation Proclamation\"====\n{{Main article|Second Emancipation Proclamation}}\nIn the early 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates developed a strategy to call on President [[John F. Kennedy]] to bypass a Southern segregationist opposition in the Congress by issuing an [[executive order]] to put an end to segregation. This envisioned document was referred to as the \"Second Emancipation Proclamation\".\n\n===President John F. Kennedy===\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy appeared on national television to address the issue of civil rights. Kennedy, who had been routinely criticized as timid by some of the leaders of the civil rights movement, told Americans that [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|two black students had been peacefully enrolled]] in the University of Alabama with the aid of the National Guard despite the opposition of Governor [[George Wallace]].\n\nJohn Kennedy called it a \"moral issue\"<ref name=Peniel/> Invoking the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation he said \n\n{{cquote|One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free. We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise.

Historian [[Peniel E. Joseph]] holds Lyndon Johnson's ability to get that bill, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], passed on July 2, 1964 was aided by \"the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech\" which turned \"the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal\".<ref name=Peniel>{{cite news |title=Kennedy's Finest Moment |author=Peniel E.

Johnson===\nDuring the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] invoked the Emancipation Proclamation holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented.\n\nAs Vice President while speaking from Gettysburg on May 30, 1963 (Memorial Day), at the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, Johnson connected it directly with the ongoing civil rights struggles of the time saying \"One hundred years ago, the slave was freed. One hundred years later, the Negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin.... In this hour, it is not our respective races which are at stake\u2014it is our nation. Let those who care for their country come forward, North and South, white and Negro, to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision.... Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent we shall have fallen short of assuring freedom to the free.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Remarks of Vice President Lyndon B.

This was one week after violence had been inflicted on peaceful civil rights marchers during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. Johnson said \"... it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And [[We Shall Overcome#Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements|we shall overcome]]. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed\u2014more than 100 years\u2014since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln\u2014a great President of another party\u2014signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed\u2014more than 100 years\u2014since equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=We Shall Overcome|author=Lyndon B.

Popularly known as the '''Desert Fox''', he served as [[field marshal]] in the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]]  during [[World War II]].\n\nRommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' for his actions on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. In 1937 he published his classic book on military tactics, ''[[Infantry Attacks]]'', drawing on his experiences from World War I. In World War II, he distinguished himself as the commander of the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] during the [[Battle of France|1940 invasion of France]]. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the [[North African Campaign]] established his reputation as one of the most able tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname ''der W\u00fcstenfuchs'', \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he earned a strong reputation for [[chivalry]], and the North African campaign has often been called a \"war without hate\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Bierman |first= John | last2= Smith| first2=Colin | author-link2 = Colin Smith (journalist) |year=2004 |title=War Without Hate: The Desert Campaign of 1940\u201343 |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Books |page= |isbn= 978-0142003947 }}</ref> He later commanded the German forces opposing the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cross-channel [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.\n\nRommel supported the [[Nazi seizure of power]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], although his reluctant stance towards [[antisemitism]], [[Nazi ideology]] and level of knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] remain a matter of debate among scholars.{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=28, 355, 361}}{{sfn|Scheck|2010}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=18, 122, 139, 147}}{{sfn|Hart|2014|p=128-52}}{{sfn|Von Fleischhauer|Friedmann|2012|}} In 1944, Rommel was [[#Plot against Hitler|implicated]] in the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate Hitler. Due to Rommel's status as a national hero, Hitler desired to eliminate him quietly instead of immediately executing him, as many other plotters were. Rommel was given a choice between committing [[suicide]], in return for assurances that his reputation would remain intact and that his family would not be persecuted following his death, or facing a trial that would result in his disgrace and execution; he chose the former and committed suicide using a [[cyanide pill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/europe/manfred-rommel-son-of-german-field-marshal-dies-at-84.html|title=Manfred Rommel, Son of German Field Marshal, Dies at 84|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=9 November 2013|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref> Rommel was given a state funeral, and it was announced that he had succumbed to his injuries from the strafing of his staff car in Normandy.\n\nRommel has become a larger-than-life figure in both Allied and [[Nazi propaganda]], and in postwar popular culture, with numerous authors considering him an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of the [[Third Reich]] although this assessment is contested by other authors as the [[Rommel myth]]. Rommel's reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the [[Wiederbewaffnung|West German rearmament]] and reconciliation between the former enemies \u2013 the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] on one side and the new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] on the other. Several of Rommel's former subordinates, notably his chief of staff [[Hans Speidel]], played key roles in [[Wiederbewaffnung|German rearmament]] and integration into [[NATO]] in the postwar era. The German Army's largest military base, the [[Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf]], is named in his honour.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Early life and career ==\nRommel was born on 15 November 1891 in [[Southern Germany]] at [[Heidenheim an der Brenz|Heidenheim]], {{convert|45|km|mi}} from [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]], then part of the [[German Empire]]. He was the third of five children of Erwin Rommel Senior (1860\u20131913), a teacher and school administrator, and his wife Helene von Lutz, whose father [[Karl von Luz]] headed the local government council. As a young man Rommel's father had been a lieutenant in the artillery. Rommel had one older sister, an art teacher who was his favorite sibling, one older brother named Manfred who died in infancy and two younger brothers, of whom one became a successful dentist and the other an opera singer.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=8}}{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=26\u201327}}{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Pimlott|2003|p=9}}\n\nAt age 18 Rommel joined the local 124th W\u00fcrttemberg Infantry Regiment as a ''[[F\u00e4hnrich]]'' ([[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]), in 1910, studying at the Officer Cadet School in [[Danzig]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=10}} He graduated in November 1911 and was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] in January 1912 and was assigned to the 124th Infantry in [[Weingarten, W\u00fcrttemberg|Weingarten]].{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=30\u201331}} He was posted to Ulm in March 1914 to the 46th Field Artillery Regiment, [[XIII (Royal W\u00fcrttemberg) Corps]], as a battery commander. He returned to the 124th when war was declared.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=43}} While at Cadet School, Rommel met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894\u20131971), of Polish and Italian descent.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=31}}\n\n== World War I ==\n[[File:Erwin Rommel.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant Rommel in Italy, 1917.]]\n\nDuring World War I, Rommel fought in [[France]] as well as in the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaigns]]. He successfully employed the tactics of penetrating enemy lines with heavy covering fire coupled with rapid advances, as well as moving forward rapidly to a flanking position to arrive at the rear of hostile positions, to achieve tactical surprise.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=4}} His first combat experience was on 22 August 1914 as a platoon commander near Verdun, when \u2013 catching a French garrison unprepared \u2013 Rommel and three men opened fire on them without ordering the rest of his platoon forward.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=25, 27\u201329}} The armies continued to skirmish in open engagements throughout September, as the static [[trench warfare]] typical of the First World War was still in the future.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=31}} For his actions in September 1914 and January 1915, Rommel was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=36, 43}} Rommel was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) and transferred to the newly created Royal Wurttemberg Mountain Battalion of the ''[[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]'' in September 1915, as a company commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=43, 45}} In November 1916 in Danzig, Rommel and Lucia married.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=19}}\n\nIn August 1917, his unit was involved in the [[Second Battle of Oituz|battle for Mount Cosna]], a heavily fortified objective on the border between Hungary and Romania, which they took after two weeks of difficult uphill fighting.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=53\u201360}} The Mountain Battalion was next assigned to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Isonzo front]], in a mountainous area in Italy. The offensive, known as the [[Battle of Caporetto]], began on 24 October 1917.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=65\u201367}} Rommel's battalion, consisting of three rifle companies and a machine gun unit, was part of an attempt to take enemy positions on three mountains: [[Kolovrat (mountain ridge)|Kolovrat]], [[Matajur]], and Stol.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=14}} In two and a half days, from 25 to 27 October, Rommel and his 150 men captured 81 guns and 9,000 men (including 150 officers), at the loss of six dead and 30 wounded.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=15}} Rommel achieved this remarkable success by taking advantage of the terrain to outflank the Italian forces, attacking from unexpected directions or behind enemy lines, and taking the initiative to attack when he had orders to the contrary. In one instance, the Italian forces, taken by surprise and believing that their lines had collapsed, surrendered after a brief firefight.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=71\u201377}} In this battle, Rommel helped pioneer [[infiltration tactics]], a new form of maneuver warfare just being adopted by German armies, and later by foreign armies,{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=18\u201325}}{{sfn|Grossman|1993|pp=316\u2013335}} and described by some as Blitzkrieg without tanks.{{sfn|House|1985|p=36}}{{sfn|Carver|2005|p=321}} He played no role in the early adoption of Blitzkrieg in World War II though.{{sfn|Carver|2005|p=321}} Acting as advance guard in the capture of [[Longarone]] on 9 November, Rommel again decided to attack with a much smaller force. Convinced that they were surrounded by an entire German division, the 1st Italian Infantry Division \u2013 10,000 men \u2013 surrendered to Rommel. For this and his actions at Matajur, he received the order of [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]].{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=18\u201325}}\n\nIn January 1918, Rommel was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (captain) and assigned to a staff position with XLIV Army Corps, where he served for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=78\u201381}}\n\n== Between the wars ==\nRommel remained with the 124th Regiment until 1 October 1920, when he was named a company commander in the 13th Infantry Regiment in Stuttgart, a post he held with the rank of captain for the next nine years.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=15}} His regiment was involved in quelling riots and civil disturbances that were occurring throughout Germany at this time.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=100}} Wherever possible, he avoided the use of force in these confrontations.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=86}} He decided against storming the city of [[Lindau]], which had been taken by revolutionary communists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schweizer|first1=Karl|title=\"Nach Absetzung der Dynastie zur freien Republik erkl\u00e4rt\" Aus den Tagen der Novemberrevolution 1918 und der R\u00e4terepublik 1919 in Lindau/Bodensee|page=7|url=http://www.edition-inseltor-lindau.de/novemberrevolution1918.pdf}}</ref> Instead, Rommel negotiated with the city council and managed to return it to the legitimate government through diplomatic means.{{sfn|Scheck|2010}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=18}} This was followed by another bloodless defence of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]].{{sfn|Remy|2015|p=100}} Historian [[:de:Raffael Scheck|Raffael Scheck]] praises Rommel for being a coolheaded and moderate mind, exceptional among the massive violence caused by takeovers of many revolutionary cities by regular and irregular units.{{sfn|Scheck|2010}} After that, he was posted to the Ruhr where a red army was responsible for fomenting unrest. This episode left an indelible impression on Rommel's mind, and also that of Hitler (like Rommel, he had also experienced the solidarity of trench warfare) who participated in the suppression of the First and Second Bavarian Soviet Republics by the Reichswehr, that, according to Reuth, \"Everyone in this Republic was fighting each other\", and that there were people trying to convert Germany into a socialist republic on the Soviet lines. The need for national unity thus became a decisive legacy of the first World War.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=18}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0313-503, Goslar, Hitler schreitet Ehrenkompanie ab.jpg|thumb|Rommel and [[Adolf Hitler]] in Goslar, 1934]]\nHe was assigned as an instructor at the [[Dresden]] Infantry School from 1929 to 1933, and was promoted to major in April 1932.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=15}}{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=98}} While at Dresden, he wrote a manual on infantry training, published in 1934.

That went against Schirach's express wishes, who appealed directly to Hitler. Consequently, Rommel was quietly removed from the project in 1938.{{sfn|Searle|2014|pp=19\u201321}} He was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' (colonel) on 1 August 1937, and in 1938, Rommel was appointed commandant of the [[Theresian Military Academy]] at [[Wiener Neustadt]].{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=137}} In October 1938 Hitler specially requested that Rommel be seconded to command the ''[[F\u00fchrerbegleitbrigade|F\u00fchrerbegleitbatallion]]'' (his escort battalion).{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=142}} This unit accompanied him whenever he traveled outside of Germany.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=9}} During this period he indulged his interest in engineering and mechanics by learning about the inner workings and maintenance of internal combustion engines and heavy machine guns.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=100, 103}} He memorized [[logarithm tables]] in his spare time, and enjoyed skiing and other outdoor sports.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=99}}\n\n== World War II ==\n\n=== Poland 1939 ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-013-0064-35, Polen, Bormann, Hitler, Rommel, v.

He described the devastated Warsaw in a letter to his wife, concluding with: \"There has been no water, no power, no gas, no food for two days.

By the third day Rommel and the advance elements of his division, together with a detachment of the 5th Panzer Division under Colonel Hermann Werner, had reached the [[River Meuse]], where they found the bridges had already been destroyed ([[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]] and [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt|Reinhardt]] reached the river on the same day).{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=154\u2013155}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Bevin |title=Inside the Nazi War Machine: How Three Generals Unleashed Hitler's Blitzkrieg Upon the World |date=2008|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=9781101460917|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsN2SVvNZZYC&pg=PT104}}</ref> Rommel was active in the forward areas, directing the efforts to make a crossing, which were initially unsuccessful due to suppressive fire by the French on the other side of the river. Rommel brought up tanks and [[flak]] units to provide counter-fire and had nearby houses set on fire to create a smokescreen. He sent infantry across in rubber boats, appropriated the bridging tackle of the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]], personally grabbed a light machine gun to fight off a French counterattack supported by tanks, and went into the water himself, encouraging the sappers and helping lash together the pontoons.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2009|p=71}} By 16 May Rommel reached [[Avesnes]], and contravening all orders and doctrine, he pressed on to Cateau.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=160\u2013161}} That night, the French II Army Corps was shattered and on 17 May, Rommel's forces took 10,000 prisoners, losing 36 men in the process. He was surprised to find out only his vanguard had followed his tempestuous surge. The High Command and Hitler had been extremely nervous about his disappearance, although they awarded him the Knight's Cross. Rommel's (and Guderian's) successes and the new possibilities offered by the new tank arm were welcomed by a small number of generals, but worried and paralysed the rest.{{sfn|Krause|Phillips|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1DLRMQfzyVwC&pg=PA176 p. 176].}}\n\n==== Battle of Arras ====\n{{Main article|Battle of Arras (1940)}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-045-08, Westfeldzug, Rommel bei Besprechung mit Offizieren.jpg|thumb|left|Rommel and staff during the [[Battle for France]], June 1940 ]]\n\nOn 20 May Rommel reached [[Arras]].{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=164}} General [[Hermann Hoth]] received orders that the town should be bypassed and its British garrison thus isolated.

On 27 November the British attack on Tobruk linked up with the defenders, and Rommel, having suffered losses that could not easily be replaced, had to concentrate on regrouping the divisions that had attacked into Egypt. By 7 December Rommel fell back to a defensive line at Gazala, just west of Tobruk, all the while under heavy attack from the [[Desert Air Force]]. The Bardia garrison surrendered on 2 January and Halfaya on 17 January 1942.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|pp=291\u2013293}} The Allies kept up the pressure, and Rommel was forced to retreat all the way back to the starting positions he had held in March, reaching [[El Agheila]] in December 1941.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=304}} The British had retaken almost all of Cyrenaica, but Rommel's retreat dramatically shortened his supply lines.{{sfn|Douglas-Home|1973|p=131}}\n\n==== Battle of Gazala and capture of Tobruk ====\n\nSpring, 1942\n\n{{Main article|Battle of Gazala}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-785-0296-22A, Nordafrika, Rommel im Befehlsfahrzeug \"Greif\".jpg|thumb|left|North Africa, Rommel in a [[Sd.Kfz. 250]]/3]]\n\nOn 5 January 1942 the Afrika Korps received 55 tanks and new supplies and Rommel started planning a counterattack.

The Axis forces retook Benghazi on 29 January and [[Timimi]] on 3 February, with the Allies pulling back to a defensive line just before the Tobruk area south of the coastal town of Gazala.

Unlike the British, the Axis forces had no armoured reserve; all operable equipment was put into immediate service. Rommel's [[Panzer Army Africa]] had a force of 320 German tanks; 50 of these were the light [[Panzer II]] model. In addition, 240 Italian tanks were in service, but these were also under-gunned and poorly armoured.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=196}}\n\n[[File:Map of siege of Tobruk 1942.jpg|thumb|Situation in \"the Cauldron\", 27 May 1942]]\n\nEarly in the afternoon of 26 May 1942, Rommel attacked first and the [[Battle of Gazala]] commenced. Italian infantry supplemented with small numbers of armoured forces assaulted the centre of the Gazala fortifications. To give the impression that this was the main assault, spare aircraft engines mounted on trucks were used to create huge clouds of dust. Ritchie was not convinced by this display, and left the 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades in position at the south end of the Commonwealth position.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=323\u2013324}} Under the cover of darkness, the bulk of Rommel's motorized and armoured forces (15th and 21st Panzers, 90th Light Division, and the Italian Ariete and Trieste Divisions) drove south to skirt the left flank of the British, coming up behind them and attacking to the north the following morning.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=45}} Throughout the day a running armour battle occurred, where both sides took heavy losses. The Grant tanks proved to be impossible to knock out except at close range.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=326}}\n\nRenewing the attack on the morning of 28 May, Rommel concentrated on encircling and destroying separate units of the British armour. Repeated British counterattacks threatened to cut off and destroy the Afrika Korps. Running low on fuel, Rommel assumed a defensive posture, forming \"the Cauldron\". He made use of the extensive British minefields to shield his western flank. Meanwhile, Italian infantry cleared a path through the mines to provide supplies. On 30 May Rommel resumed the offensive, attacking westwards to link with elements of Italian X Corps, which had cleared a path through the Allied minefields to establish a supply line.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=325\u2013327}} On 1 June, Rommel accepted the surrender of some 3,000 soldiers of the 150th Brigade.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=330}} On 6 June, 90th Light Division and the ''Trieste'' Division assaulted the Free French strongpoint in the [[Battle of Bir Hakeim]], but the defenders continued to thwart the attack until finally evacuating on 10 June.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=331}} With his communications and the southern strongpoint of the British line thus secured, Rommel shifted his attack north again, relying on the British minefields of the Gazala lines to protect his left flank.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=217}} Threatened with being completely cut off, the British began a retreat eastward toward Egypt on 14 June, the so-called \"Gazala Gallop.\"{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=334}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-785-0293-11, Tobruk, Sch\u00fctzenpanzer, Panzer.jpg|thumb|left|The Afrika Korps enters Tobruk.]]\n\nOn 15 June Axis forces reached the coast, cutting off the escape for the Commonwealth forces still occupying the Gazala positions.

However, Hitler viewed the North African campaign primarily as a way to assist his Italian allies, not as an objective in and of itself. He would not consider sending Rommel the reinforcements and supplies he needed to take and hold Egypt, as this would have required diverting men and supplies from his primary focus: the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=911\u2013912}}\n\nRommel's success at Tobruk worked against him, as Hitler no longer felt it was necessary to proceed with [[Operation Herkules]], the proposed attack on Malta.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=342}} Auchinleck relieved Ritchie of command of the Eighth Army on 25 June, and temporarily took command himself.{{sfn|Butler|2015|pp=339, 343}} Rommel knew that delay would only benefit the British, who continued to receive supplies at a faster rate than Rommel could hope to achieve.

This region is a natural choke point, where the [[Qattara Depression]] creates a relatively short line to defend that could not be outflanked to the south because of the steep escarpment. On 1 July the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] began. Rommel had around 100 available tanks. The Allies were able to achieve local air superiority, with heavy bombers attacking the 15th and 21st Panzers, who had also been delayed by a sandstorm. The 90th Light Division veered off course and were pinned down by South African artillery fire.

The terrain left Rommel with no choice but to follow a similar tactic as he had at previous battles: the bulk of the forces attempted to sweep around from the south while secondary attacks were launched on the remainder of the front.

By the end of 25 October, 15th Panzers, the defenders in this sector, had only 31 serviceable tanks remaining of their initial force of 119.{{sfn|Fraser|1993|p=373}} Rommel brought the 21st Panzer and Ariete Divisions north on 26 October, to bolster the sector. On the 28th, Montgomery shifted his focus to the coast, ordering his 1st and 10th Armoured Divisions to attempt to swing around and cut off Rommel's line of retreat. Meanwhile, Rommel concentrated his attack on the Allied [[Salient (military)|salient]] at Kidney Ridge, inflicting heavy losses.

Heavy rains slowed movements and grounded the Desert Air Force, which aided the withdrawal. Those parts of Panzerarmee Africa that were motorized slipped away from El Alamein, but were under pressure from the pursuing Eighth Army. A series of short delaying actions was fought over the coastal highway, but no line could be held for any length of time, as Rommel lacked the armour and fuel to defend his open southern flank.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=190}} Rommel continued to retreat west, abandoning Halfaya Pass, Sollum, Mersa Brega and El Agheila.{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=11}} The line Rommel was aiming for was 'Gabes gap' in Tunisia.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=192}} Luftwaffe Field Marshal Kesselring strongly criticized Rommel's decision to retreat all the way to Tunisia, as each airfield the Germans abandoned extended the range of the Allied bombers and fighters. Rommel defended his decision, pointing out that if he tried to assume a defensive position the Allies would destroy his forces and take the airfields anyway; the retreat saved the lives of his remaining men and shortened his supply lines. By now, Rommel's remaining forces fought in reduced strength combat groups, whereas the Allied forces had great numerical superiority and control of the air. Upon his arrival in [[Tunisia]], Rommel noted with some bitterness the reinforcements, including the 10th Panzer Division, arriving in Tunisia following the Allied invasion of Morocco.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|pp=342\u2013357}}\n\n===== Tunisia =====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-071-31, Nordafrika, Rommel, Bayerlein.jpg|thumb|left|Rommel speaks with troops who are using a captured American M3 half-track, Tunisia.]]\n\nHaving reached Tunisia, Rommel launched an attack against the [[U.S. II Corps]] which was threatening to cut his lines of supply north to Tunis.

While Rommel was at Kasserine at the end of January 1943, the Italian General [[Giovanni Messe]] was appointed commander of Panzer Army Africa, renamed the Italo-German Panzer Army in recognition of the fact that it consisted of one German and three Italian corps. Though Messe replaced Rommel, he diplomatically deferred to him, and the two coexisted in what was theoretically the same command. On 23 February ''Armeegruppe Afrika'' was created with Rommel in command. It included the Italo-German Panzer Army under Messe (renamed 1st Italian Army) and the German 5th Panzer Army in the north of Tunisia under General [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim]].\n\nThe last Rommel offensive in North Africa was on 6 March 1943, when he attacked Eighth Army at the [[Battle of Medenine]].{{sfn|Coggins|1980|p=134}} The attack was made with [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th]], [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]], and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st]] Panzer Divisions.

On 16 August 1943 Rommel's headquarters moved to [[Lake Garda]] in northern Italy and formally assumed command of the army group, which consisted of the [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|44th Infantry Division]], the [[26th Panzer Division]] and the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]. When Italy announced armistice with the Allies on 8 September, his forces took part in [[Operation Achse]], disarming the Italian forces.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=115\u2013116}}\n\nHitler met with Rommel and Kesselring to discuss future operations in Italy on 30 September 1943. Rommel insisted on a defensive line north of Rome, while Kesselring was more optimistic and advocated holding a line south of Rome. Hitler preferred Kesselring's appreciation and therefore revoked his prior decision for a subsequent subordination of Kesselring's forces to Rommel's army group. On 19 October Hitler decided that Kesselring would be the overall commander of the forces in Italy, sidelining Rommel.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=117}}\n\nRommel had wrongly predicted that the collapse of the German line in Italy would be fast. On 21 November Hitler gave Kesselring overall command of the Italian theater, moving Rommel and Army Group B to [[Normandy]] in France with responsibility for defending the French coast against the long anticipated Allied invasion.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=117}}\n\n=== Atlantic Wall 1944 ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-300-1863-29, Riva-Bella, Waffenvorf\u00fchrung Panzerwerfer, Rommel.jpg|thumb|right|Rommel observes the fall of shot at Riva-Bella, just north of Caen in the area that would become [[Sword Beach]] in Normandy.]]\nThere was broad disagreement in the German High Command as to how best to meet the expected allied invasion of Northern France. The Commander-in-Chief West, Gerd von Rundstedt, believed there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches due to the firepower possessed by the Allied navies, as had been experienced at [[Allied invasion of Italy#German counterattacks|Salerno]].{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}} He argued that the German armour should be held in reserve well inland near [[Paris]] where they could be used to counter-attack in force in a more traditional military doctrine. The allies could be allowed to extend themselves deep into France where a battle for control would be fought, allowing the Germans to envelop the allied forces in a pincer movement, cutting off their avenue of retreat. He feared the piecemeal commitment of their armoured forces would cause them to become caught in a battle of attrition which they could not hope to win.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}}\n\n<!---[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16796, Rommel mit Soldaten der Legion \"Freies Indien\".jpg|thumb|Inspecting the [[Indische Legion|Free India Legion]], France, 1944]]--->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0240-35, Pas de Calais, Atlantikwall, Luftlandehindernisse.jpg|thumb|left| A sketch by Rommel.

These tactics were still effective on the Eastern Front, where control of the air was important but did not dominate the action. Rommel's own experiences at the end of the North African campaign revealed to him that the Germans would not be allowed to preserve their armour from air attack for this type of massed assault.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}} Rommel believed their only opportunity would be to oppose the landings directly at the beaches, and to counterattack there before the invaders could become well established. Though there had been some defensive positions established and gun emplacements made, the [[Atlantic Wall]] was a token defensive line. Rundstedt had confided to Rommel that it was for propaganda purposes only.{{sfn|Lewin|1998|p=213}}\n\nUpon arriving in Northern France Rommel was dismayed by the lack of completed works. According to [[Friedrich Ruge|Ruge]], Rommel was in a staff position and could not issue orders, but he took every effort to explain his plan to commanders down to the platoon level, who took up his words eagerly, but \"more or less open\" opposition from the above slowed down the process.<ref name=\"Ruge160415\"/> Finally, Rundstedt, who only respected Rommel grudgingly (he called him Field Marshal Cub),{{sfn|Mitcham|1997|p=15, 23}}{{sfn|Messenger|2009|p=166}} intervened and supported Rommel's request for being made a commander.{{sfn|Brighton|2008|p=247}} It was granted in January or February 1944, when \"much valuable time had been lost.\"<ref name=\"Ruge160415\">{{cite web|last1=Ruge|last2=Dihm|first1=Friedrich|first2=Friedrich|title=Rommel and the Atlantic Wall December 1943 - July 1944 Oral History - World War II - Invasion of Normandy (1944)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/rommel-atlantic-wall.html#352|website=Naval History and Heritage Command (US)|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>\nHe set out to improve the fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]] with great energy and engineering skill.{{refn|Lieb: Of course, Rommel did not conceive all these devices himself&nbsp;...

In late April, he ordered the [[I SS Panzer Corps]] placed near Paris, far enough inland to be useless to Rommel, but not far enough for Rundstedt. Rommel moved those armoured formations under his command as far forward as possible, ordering General [[Erich Marcks]], commanding the 84th Corps defending the Normandy section, to move his reserves into the frontline. Although Rommel was the dominating personality in Normandy with Rundstedt willing to delegate most of the responsibilities to him (the central reserve was Rundstedt's idea but he did not oppose to some form of coastal defense, and gradually came under the influence of Rommel's thinking), Rommel's strategy of an armor-supported coastal defense line was opposed by some officers, most notably [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]], who was supported by Guderian.{{sfn|Cad\u0111ick-Adams|2013|p=221}}{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=69}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Gordon|title=US Army in WW II: European Theater of Operations, Cross Channel Attack|date=1951|isbn=978-0-7948-3739-6|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAW3D9GIHQC&pg=PA247}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=D-Day To Berlin|date=2004|isbn=978-0-340-83397-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAW3D9GIHQC&pg=PA247}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Brighton|first1=Terry|title=Patton, Montgomery, Rommel: Masters of War|date=2008|isbn=978-1-4001-1497-9|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85nbrwEmgSYC&pg=PA247}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=The Book of War: 25 Centuries of Great War Writing -On the Other Side of the Hill|date=1999|isbn=978-0-14-029655-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4c6n8T9rNeMC&pg=PT359}}</ref> Hitler compromised and gave Rommel three divisions (the 2nd, the 21st and the 116th Panzer), let Rundstedt retain four and turned the other three to Army Group G, pleasing no one.{{sfn|Mitcham|1997|p=198}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Joshua|title=Operation Fortitude: The Story of the Spies and the Spy Operation That Saved D-Day|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7627-7735-8|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQWiCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8}}</ref>\n\nThe Allies staged elaborate deceptions for [[D-Day]] (see [[Operation Fortitude]]), giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais. Although Hitler himself expected a Normandy invasion for a while, Rommel and most Army commanders in France believed there would be two invasions, with the main invasion coming at the Pas-de-Calais. Rommel drove defensive preparations all along the coast of Northern France, particularly concentrating fortification building in the [[River Somme]] estuary. By D-Day on 6 June 1944 nearly all the German staff officers, including Hitler's staff, believed that Pas-de-Calais was going to be the main invasion site, and continued to believe so even after the landings in Normandy had occurred.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=89}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-718-0149-12A, Paris, Rommel, von Rundstedt, Gause und Zimmermann.jpg|thumb|left|Generalfeldmarsch\u00e4lle [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and Erwin Rommel meeting in Paris.]]\n\nThe 5 June storm in the channel seemed to make a landing very unlikely, and a number of the senior officers were away from their units for training exercises and various other efforts. On 4 June the chief meteorologist of the 3 Air Fleet reported that weather in the channel was so poor there could be no landing attempted for two weeks. On 5 June Rommel left France and on 6 June he was at home celebrating his wife's birthday.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=121}} He was recalled and returned to his headquarters at 10{{nbsp}}pm. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Rundstedt had requested the reserves be transferred to his command. At 10{{nbsp}}am Keitel advised that Hitler declined to release the reserves but that Rundstedt could move the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]] closer to the coast, with the [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]] placed on standby. Later in the day, Rundstedt received authorisation to move additional units in preparation for a counterattack, which Rundstedt decided to launch on 7 June. Upon arrival, Rommel concurred with the plan. By nightfall, Rundstedt, Rommel and Speidel continued to believe that the Normandy landing might have been a diversionary attack, as the Allied deception measures still pointed towards Calais. The 7 June counterattack did not take place as the 12th SS did not arrive on time due to the Allied air bombardments.{{sfn|Messenger|2009|p=168\u2013170}} All this made the German command structure in France in disarray during the opening hours of the D-Day invasion.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|p=83}}\n\nFacing relatively small-scale German counterattacks, the Allies secured five beachheads by nightfall of 6 June, landing 155,000 troops.{{sfn|Messenger|2009|p=169}} The Allies pushed ashore and expanded their beachhead despite strong German resistance. Rommel believed that if his armies pulled out of range of Allied naval fire, it would give them a chance to regroup and re-engage them later with a better chance of success. While he managed to convince Rundstedt, they still needed to win over Hitler. At a meeting with Hitler in [[Margival]] on 17 June, Rommel warned Hitler about the inevitable collapse in the German defences, but was rebuffed and told to focus on military operations.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=125}}{{sfn|Hart|2014|p=146}}\n\nBy mid-July the German position was crumbling.

The conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty. [[Erwin von Witzleben]], who would have become commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht had the plot succeeded, was a field marshal, but had been inactive since 1942.

In the autumn of 1941 and early winter of 1941/1942, he was mentioned in the British press almost daily. Toward the end of the year, the Reich propaganda machine also used Rommel's successes in Africa as a diversion from the Wehrmacht's challenging situation in the Soviet Union with the stall of [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=136\u2013139}}{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=471}}{{refn|group=N|[[Peter Caddick-Adams]]: \"Rommel's advances over the winter 1941\u201342 became a very useful distraction away from Germany's failure before Moscow\".{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=471}}}} The American press soon began to take notice of Rommel as well, following the country's entry into the war on 11 December 1941, writing that \"The British (...) admire him because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general\".

He became a symbol that was used to reinforce the German public's faith in an ultimate Axis victory.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=150\u2013152}}\n\n===Military reverses===\n\nIn the wake of the successful British offensive in November 1942 and other military reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasize Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. To ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the [[OKH|Supreme High Command]] announce in May 1943 that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=154\u2013158}}{{refn|group=N|[[Peter Lieb]]: \"Hitler was well aware that it would be unwise (...) to link the downfall of Army Group Africa to the name of Rommel, the child of Joseph Goebbel's propaganda machinery\".{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=113}}}} Instead, the campaign was presented, by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=154\u2013158}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0243-33, Atlantikwall, Inspektion Erwin Rommel mit Offizieren.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many propaganda photographs of Rommel on inspection tours of the [[Atlantic wall]].]]\nAlthough Rommel then entered a period without a significant command, he remained a household name in Germany, synonymous with the aura of invincibility.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=113\u2013115, 117\u2013118}} Hitler then made Rommel part of his defensive strategy for [[Fortress Europe]] (''Festung Europa'') by sending him to the West to inspect fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]]. Goebbels supported the decision, noting in his diary that Rommel was \"undoubtedly the suitable man\" for the task. The propaganda minister expected the move to reassure the German public and at the same time to have a negative impact on the Allied forces' morale.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nIn France, a Wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for both domestic and foreign audiences.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|p=120}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=159}} In May 1944 the German newsreels reported on Rommel's speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that \"every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland\". The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\nWhen Rommel was seriously wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry undertook efforts to conceal the injury so as not to undermine domestic morale. Despite those, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at the 1 August press conference. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\n===Rommel's views on propaganda===\n\nRommel was interested in propaganda, beyond the promotion of his own image. In 1944, after visiting Rommel in France and reading his proposals on counteracting Allied propaganda, Alfred-Ingemar Berndt remarked: \"He is also interested in this propaganda business and wants to develop it by all means. He has even thought and brought out practical suggestions for each program and subject.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Thomas|title=Propaganda-Star Ein Mythos entsteht|url=http://www.swr.de/rommel/propaganda-start/ein-mythos-entsteht/-/id=10224974/did=10224880/nid=10224974/ktgj7v/index.html|accessdate= 2016-08-04 }}</ref>\n\nRommel saw the propaganda and education values in his and his nation's deeds (He also did value justice itself: According to Admiral Ruge's diary, Rommel told Ruge: \"Justice is the indispensable foundation of a nation. Unfortunately the higher-ups are not clean. The slaughterings are grave sins.\"{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=247}}) The key to the successful creating of an image, according to Rommel, was leading by example: \"The men tend to feel no kind of contact with a commander who, they know, is sitting somewhere in headquarters. What they want is what might be termed a physical contact with him. In moments of panic, fatigue, or disorganization, or when something out of the ordinary has to be demanded from them, the personal example of the commander works wonders, especially if he has had the wit to create some sort of legend around himself.\"{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=241}} He urged Axis authorities to treat the Arab with the utmost respect to prevent uprisings behind the front.<ref name=\"Rommel had, in fact, earlier asked the Italian High Command to order their men to treat the Arabs with respect\">{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Charles F.|title=Discovering the Rommel Murder|isbn=978-0-8117-4278-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diF6jjpgpfgC&pg=PT59}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Ben H.|title=Hitler's Soldiers: The German Army in the Third Reich|date=28 June 2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507903-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7AODAAAQBAJ&pg=PT356}}</ref>\n\nHe protested the use of propaganda at the cost of explicit military benefits though.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=324}} Ruge suggests that his chief treated his own fame as a kind of weapon.<ref name=\"Ruge160415\"/>\n\nThe political scientist and historian [[Randall Hansen]] suggests that Rommel chose his whole command style for the purpose of spreading meritocracy and egalitarianism, as well as Nazi ideals he shared with Hitler due to their common non-aristocratic background.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Randall|authorlink = Randall Hansen|title=Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance After Valkyrie|isbn=978-0-19-992792-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DaTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48}}</ref> His egalitarianism extended to people of other races:{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=138, 139}} in replying to white South African officers' demands that the black POWs should be housed in separated compounds, he refused, commenting that the black soldiers wore the same uniforms and had fought alongside the whites, and thus were their equals.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=336}} On the other hand, Watson comments that, regarding the Afrika Korps, any Nazi indoctrination was minimised, allowing Rommel the freedom to reinvent his army in his own style.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=137}} Rommel's proposals were not always practical: in 1943, he surprised Hitler by proposing that a Jew should be made into a Gauleiter to prove to the world that Germany was innocent of accusations that Rommel had heard from the enemy's propaganda regarding the mistreatment of Jews.

When Rommel came to North Africa, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa.{{sfn|Major|2008}} The British military and political figures contributed to the heroic image of the man as Rommel resumed offensive operations in January 1942 against the British forces weakened by redeployments to the Far East. During parliamentary debate following the fall of Tobruk, Churchill described Rommel as an \"extraordinary bold and clever opponent\" and a \"great field commander\".{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|pp=141\u2013143}}\n\nAccording to ''Der Spiegel'', following the war's end, West Germany yearned for father figures who were needed to replace the former ones who had been unmasked as criminals. Rommel was chosen because he embodied the decent soldier, cunning yet fair-minded, and if guilty by association, not so guilty that he became unreliable, and additionally, former comrades reported that he was close to the Resistance.{{sfn|Von Fleischhauer|Friedmann|2012|}} While everyone else was disgraced, his star became brighter than ever, and he made the historically unprecedent leap over the threshold between eras: from Hitler's favourite general, to the young republic's hero.

Rommel was often cited in Western sources as a patriotic German willing to stand up to Hitler. Churchill wrote about him in 1950: \"[Rommel] (...) deserves our respect because, although a loyal German soldier, he came to hate Hitler and all his works, and took part in the conspiracy of 1944 to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1950|p=200}}\n\n===Foundational works===\nThe German rearmament of the early 1950s was highly dependent on the moral rehabilitation that the Wehrmacht needed. The journalist and historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]], an early proponent of these two interconnected initiatives, provided the first widely available source on Rommel in his 1948 book on Hitler's generals, updated in 1951, portraying Rommel in a positive light and as someone who stood apart from the regime.{{sfn|Searle|2014|pp=8, 27}}\n\nThe other foundational text was the influential and laudatory 1950 biography ''[[Rommel: The Desert Fox]]'' by Brigadier Desmond Young.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=478}}{{sfn|Beckett|2014|loc=I.F.W.

Speidel contributed as well, starting, from the early 1950s, to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, boosting his [Speidel's] suitability for a future role in the new military force of the Federal Republic, the [[Bundeswehr]], and then in [[NATO]].{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=474}}\n\nFurther in 1953 was the publication of Rommel's writings of the war period as ''The Rommel Papers'', edited by Liddell Hart.{{sfn|Connelly|2014|p=163}} The book contributed to the perception of Rommel as a brilliant commander; in an introduction, Liddell Hart drew comparisons between Rommel and [[Lawrence of Arabia]], \"two masters of desert warfare\".{{sfn|Major|2008|p=526}} Liddell Hart had a personal interest in the work: by having coaxed Rommel's widow to include material favorable to himself, he could present Rommel as his \"pupil\". The controversy was described by the political scientist [[John Mearsheimer]], who concluded that, by \"manipulating history\", Liddell Hart was in a position to show that he was at the root of the dramatic German success in 1940.{{sfn|Mearsheimer|1988|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Luvaas|1990|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===Elements of the myth===\n[[File:Rommel's Africa uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|Allegedly Rommel's desert uniform and [[death mask]] (right) displayed at the [[German Tank Museum]] in [[Munster, Lower Saxony|Munster]].]]\nAccording to Connelly, Young and Liddell Hart laid the foundation for the Anglo-American myth, which consisted of three themes: Rommel's ambivalence towards Nazism; his military genius; and the emphasis of the chivalrous nature of the fighting in North Africa.{{sfn|Connelly|2014|p=163}} Their works lent support to the image of the \"[[clean Wehrmacht]]\" and were generally not questioned, since they came from British authors, rather than German revisionists.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2012|p=483}}{{refn|group=N|Kitchen: \"The North African campaign has usually been seen, as in the title of Rommel's account, as 'War without Hate', and thus as further proof that the German army was not involved in any sordid butchering, which was left to Himmler's SS.

According to Watson, the most dominant element is Rommel the Superior Soldier; the second being Rommel the Common Man; and the last one Rommel the Martyr.{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=157\u2013161}} The German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described the myth in 2007 as \"Gentleman warrior, military genius\".{{sfn|Friedmann|2007}}{{refn|group=N|[[Spiegel Online]]: \"Gentleman warrior, military genius.

According to the prominent German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], the modern consensus agrees with post-war sources that Rommel treated the Allied captives decently, and he personally thinks that the movie ''[[Rommel (film)|Rommel]]'' does not overstate his conscience.  Also according to Wehler, scholars in England and the US still show a lot of admiration towards Rommel the military commander.{{r|FrankAllg112012}} Some authors, notably Wolfgang Proske, see Rommel as a criminal whose memorials should be removed, although these represent the unorthodox minority (which is admitted by Proske).<ref>{{cite news|last1=KANOLD|first1=J\u00dcRGEN|title=Denkmal des Ansto\u00dfes|url=http://www.swp.de/ulm/lokales/ulm_neu_ulm/Denkmal-des-Anstosses;art4329,1355468 |accessdate= 2016-08-04 |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Paterson|first1=Tony|title=Was the Desert Fox an honest soldier or just another Nazi?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/was-the-desert-fox-an-honest-soldier-or-just-another-nazi-6272076.html|agency=www.independent.co.uk/|date=2011}}</ref> Perry and Massari note that the majority of historians continue to describe Rommel as a brilliant, chivalrous commander.{{sfn|Perry|2012|p=165}}<ref name=Massari>{{cite web|last1=Massari|first1=Ivano|title=Erwin Rommel \u2013 Desert Fox \u2013 The Bold and the Brave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdYTAAAAQBAJ&dq=rommel+chivalrous+montgomery&source=gbs_navlinks_s|website=warhistoryonline|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nModern historians who agree with the image of the apolitical, chivalrous genius{{sfn|Knopp|2013|p=54}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fredriksen|first1=John C.|title=America's Military Adversaries: From Colonial Times to the Present|date=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-603-3|page=435|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJlm7AQK-T4C&pg=PA435}}</ref>{{sfn|Strawson|2014|p=124}}<ref name=Massari/>{{sfn|Wistrich|2001|p=107}}{{sfn|Holmes|2009|p=129}}{{sfn|Bradford|2011|pp=66, 183}}{{sfn|Sadler|2016|p=63}} also have different opinions regarding details.

They point to Rommel's lack of appreciation for Germany's strategic situation, his misunderstanding of the relative importance of his theatre to the German High Command, his poor grasp of logistical realities, and, according to the historian Ian Beckett, his \"penchant for glory hunting\".{{sfn|Beckett|2014|loc=I.F.W. Beckett, Introduction, pp. 4\u20136}}{{sfn|Citino|2012}} Citino credits Rommel's limitations as an operational level commander as \"materially contributing\" to the eventual demise of the Axis forces in North Africa,{{sfn|Citino|2012}}{{refn|group=N|[[Robert Citino]]: \"[Rommel's] disinterest in the dreary science of logistics, his love of action, his tendency to fly off to wherever the fighting was hottest\u2014all of these qualities (...) are problems in a commander under modern conditions, and they all contributed materially to the disaster that ultimately befell him and his army in the desert.\"{{sfn|Citino|2012}}}} while Addington focuses on the struggle over strategy, whereby Rommel's initial brilliant success resulted in \"catastrophic effects\" for Germany in North Africa.{{sfn|Addington|1967}} Porch highlights Rommel's \"offensive mentality\", symptomatic of the Wehrmacht commanders as a whole in the belief that the tactical and operational victories would lead to strategic success. Compounding the problem was the Wehrmacht's institutional tendency to discount logistics, industrial output and their opponents' capacity to learn from past mistakes.{{sfn|Porch|2004|p=206}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey P. Megargee]] points out Rommel's playing the German and Italian command structures against each other to his advantage. Rommel used the confused structure (the OKW ([[OKW|Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht]]), the OKH ([[OKH|Supreme High Command of the Army]]) and the Italian Supreme Command) to disregard orders that he disagreed with or to appeal to whatever authority he felt would be most sympathetic to his requests.{{sfn|Megargee|2000|p=97}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-263-1598-04, Frankreich, Rommel, \"Indische Legion\".jpg|thumb|Inspecting the soldiers of the anti-British [[Indische Legion|Free India Legion]], France, 1944]]\nSome historians take issue with Rommel's absence from Normandy on the day of the Allied invasion, 6 June 1944. He had left France on 5 June and was at home on the 6th celebrating his wife's birthday. (According to Rommel, he planned to proceed to see Hitler the next day to discuss the situation in Normandy).{{sfn|Zabecki March|2016}}{{sfn|Lieb|2014}} Zabecki calls his decision to leave the theatre in view of an imminent invasion \"an incredible lapse of command responsibility\".{{sfn|Zabecki March|2016}} Lieb remarks that Rommel displayed real mental agility, but the lack of an energetic commander, together with other problems, caused the battle largely not to be conducted in his concept (which is the opposite of the German doctrine), although the result was still better than Geyr's plan.{{sfn|Lieb|2014|131-132}} \n\nT.L.McMahon argues that Rommel no doubt possessed operational vision, however Rommel did not have the strategic resources to effect his operational choices while his forces provided the tactical ability to accomplish his goals, and the German staff and system of staff command were designed for commanders who led from the front, and in some cases he might have chosen the same options as Montgomery (a reputedly strategy-oriented commander) had he been put in the same conditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=McMahon |first=T.L. |date=15 August 2014 |title=Operational Principles: The Operational Art Of Erwin Rommel And Bernard Montgomery |publisher=Pickle Partners |isbn=978-1-78289-742-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBpwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT97}}</ref> According to [[Steven Zaloga]], tactical flexibility was a great advantage of the German system, but in the final years of the war, Hitler and his cronies like Himmler and Goering had usurped more and more authority at the strategic level, leaving professionals like Rommel increasing constraints on their actions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven J.|title=D-Day 1944 (2): Utah Beach & the US Airborne Landings|date=20 July 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78200-147-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDfDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT9}}</ref> [[Martin Blumenson]] considers Rommel a general with a compelling view of strategy and logistics, which was demonstrated through his many arguments with his superiors over such matters, although Blumenson also thinks that what distinguished Rommel was his boldness, his intuitive feel for the battlefield.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>(Upon which Schwarzkopf also comments  \"Rommel had a feel for the battlefield like no other man.\"<ref name=Norman>{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Charles F.|title=Discovering the Rommel Murder|isbn=978-0-8117-4278-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diF6jjpgpfgC&pg=PT210}}</ref>)\n\nJoseph Forbes comments that: \"The complex, conflict-filled interaction between Rommel and his superiors over logistics, objectives and priorities should not be used to detract from Rommel's reputation as a remarkable military leader\", because Rommel was not given powers over logistics, and because if only generals who attain strategic-policy goals are great generals, such highly regarded commanders as Robert E.

Storbeck, Deputy Inspector General of the Bundeswehr (1987\u20131991), remarks that, Rommel's leadership style and offensive thinking, although carrying inherent risks like losing the overview of the situation and creating overlapping of authority, have been proved effective, and have been analysed and incorporated in the training of officers by \"us, our Western allies, the Warsaw Pact, and even the Israel Defense Forces.\"{{r|Storbeck041213}} Maurice Remy and Samuel Mitcham both defend his strategic decision regarding Malta as, although risky, the only logical choice.{{refn|group=N|Remy: Kesselring,&nbsp;... in his memoirs that criticizes the five year younger and much more popular Rommel,&nbsp;... he already knew at least since the war's end about American arms shipment and intention to intervene which would rendered the strategical value of Malta meaningless, that left Rommel only one choice&nbsp;...{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=107}}}}{{refn|group=N|Mitcham: General Warlimont of the High Command later wrote that he \"could in any case hardly have acted differently\" in ordering the pursuit.General Warlimont and Rommel were not exactly the best of friends&nbsp;...

With American industrial production beginning to make itself felt, while Germany bled herself white on the Russian Front, any chance of scoring a decisive victory had to be taken{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=139}}}} Mitcham also takes note of the fact that the British C-in-C actually feared that the German leadership would embark on Rommel's strategic plans regarding the Suez Canal instead of that of Hitler.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=154}}\n\nRommel was among the few Axis commanders (the others being [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]]) who were targeted for assassination by Allied planners.

He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children (boy, boy, girl, boy). His father was a [[milliner]]. His childhood was spent in Pro\u00dfnitz, where he attended the secular elementary school. Then Husserl traveled to [[Vienna]] to study at the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' there, followed next by the Staatsgymnasium in [[Olomouc]] (Ger.: Olm\u00fctz).<ref name=\"KockelmansBiographical\">Joseph J.

At Leipzig he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], one of the founders of modern psychology. Then he moved to the [[Frederick William University]] of [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) in 1878 where he continued his study of mathematics under [[Leopold Kronecker]] and the renowned [[Karl Weierstrass]]. In Berlin he found a mentor in [[Thomas Masaryk]], then a former philosophy student of [[Franz Brentano]] and later the first president of [[Czechoslovakia]]. There Husserl also attended [[Friedrich Paulsen]]'s philosophy lectures. In 1881 he left for the [[University of Vienna]] to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of [[Leo K\u00f6nigsberger]] (a former student of Weierstrass). At Vienna in 1883 he obtained his PhD with the work ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Variationsrechnung'' (''Contributions to the [[Calculus of variations|Calculus of Variations]]'').<ref name=\"KockelmansBiographical\"/>\n\nEvidently as a result of his becoming familiar with the [[New Testament]] during his twenties, Husserl asked to be baptized into the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1886. Husserl's father Adolf had died in 1884. [[Herbert Spiegelberg]] writes, \"While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience.\" At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral \"renewal\". Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational ''autonomy'' in all things, Husserl could also speak \"about his vocation and even about his mission under God's will to find new ways for philosophy and science,\" observes Spiegelberg.<ref>Spiegelberg, H. ''The Phenomenological Movement. A historical introduction''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. {{ISBN|9024702399}}. Vol. I, pp. 85\u201387. It was reported \"from witnesses of Husserl's last days \u2013 that Husserl had something like a deathbed conversion.\" Spiegelberg (1971) at I:85.</ref>\n\nFollowing his PhD in mathematics, Husserl returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to [[Karl Weierstrass]]. Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy. Then professor Weierstrass became very ill. Husserl became free to return to Vienna where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to [[philosophy]]. In 1884 at the [[University of Vienna]] he attended the lectures of [[Franz Brentano]] on philosophy and philosophical [[psychology]]. Brentano introduced him to the writings of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[John Stuart Mill|J. Stuart Mill]], and [[David Hume]]. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e.g., with regard to [[intentionality]].<ref>Spiegelberg, H., ''The Context of the Phenomenological Movement'' (Berlin/Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media]], 1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XVVFBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA134 p. 134].</ref> Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed [[Carl Stumpf]], a former student of Brentano, to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], seeking to obtain his [[habilitation]] which would qualify him to teach at the university level. There, under Stumpf's supervision, he wrote ''\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl'' (''On the Concept of Number'') in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik]]'' (1891).<ref>Kockelmans, \"Biographical Note\" per Edmund Husserl, 17\u201320, at 17\u201318, in his edited ''Phenomenology'' (Doubleday Anchor 1967). 'Husserl's 'Philosophie der Arithmetik'' is further discussed here below.</ref>\n\nIn 1887 Husserl married Malvine Steinschneider, a union that would last over fifty years. In 1892 their daughter Elizabeth was born, in 1893 their son [[Gerhart Husserl|Gerhart]], and in 1894 their son Wolfgang. Elizabeth would marry in 1922, and Gerhart in 1923; Wolfgang, however, became a casualty of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" /> Gerhart would become a philosopher of law, contributing to the subject of [[comparative law]], teaching in the United States and after the war in [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gerhart Husserl; by H.

In 1891 he published his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen]]'' which, drawing on his prior studies in mathematics and philosophy, proposed a psychological context as the basis of mathematics. It drew the adverse notice of [[Gottlob Frege]], who criticized its [[psychologism]].<ref>Cf., \"Illustrative extracts from Frege's Review of Husserl's ''Philosophie der Arithmetik''\", translated by P.T.Geach, at 79\u201385, in Peter Geach and Max Black, editors, ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1977).</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ Edmund Husserl].

Just prior to this a major work of his, ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (Halle, 1900\u20131901), was published. Volume One contains seasoned reflections on \"pure logic\" in which he carefully refutes \"psychologism\".<ref>Husserl's ''Logische'', in its disentangling of psychology from logic, also served as preparation for the later development of his work in [[phenomenological reduction]].

An Analysis of His Phenomenology'' (Northwestern University 1967) at 29\u201330. Ric\u0153ur traces Husserl's development from the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' to his later ''Ideen'' (1913), as leading from the psychological to the transcendental, regarding the intuition of essences (which the methodology of the [[phenomenological reduction]] allows). The book ''Husserl'' contains translations of Ric\u0153ur's essays of 1949\u20131967.</ref> This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey. Two years later in Italy he paid a visit to Franz Brentano his inspiring old teacher and to [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] the mathematician. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] were also now influencing his thought. In 1910 he became joint editor of the journal ''Logos''. During this period Husserl had delivered lectures on ''internal time consciousness'', which several decades later his former student Heidegger edited for publication.<ref>Husserl, ''Vorlesungen zur Ph\u00e4nomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins'' (1928), translated as ''The Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness'' (Indiana University 1964).</ref>\n\nIn 1912 at Freiburg the journal ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung'' (\"Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research\") was founded by Husserl and his school, and which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930. His important work ''Ideen''<ref>Husserl, ''Ideen au einer reinen Ph\u00e4nomenologie und ph\u00e4nomenologischen Philosophie'' (1913), translated as ''Ideas. General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (New York: Macmillan 1931; reprint Collier), with \"Author's Preface to the English Edition\" at 5\u201322. Therein, Husserl in 1931 refers to \"Transcendental Subjectivity\" being \"a new field of experience\" opened as a result of practicing [[phenomenological reduction]], and giving rise to an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' science not empirically based but somewhat similar to mathematics. By such practice the individual becomes the \"transcendental Ego\", although Husserl acknowledges the problem of [[solipsism]]. Later he emphasizes \"the necessary stressing of the difference between transcendental and psychological subjectivity, the repeated declaration that transcendental phenomenology is not in any sense psychology... \" but rather (in contrast to naturalistic psychology) by the phenomenological reduction \"the life of the soul is made intelligible in its most intimate and originally instuitional essence\" and whereby \"objects of the most varied grades right up to the level of the objective world are there for the Ego... .\" ''Ibid.'' at 5\u20137, 11\u201312, 18.</ref> was published in its first issue. Before beginning ''Ideen'' Husserl's thought had reached the stage where \"each subject is 'presented' to itself, and to each all others are 'presentiated' (''Vergegenw\u00e4rtigung''), not as parts of nature but as pure consciousness.\"<ref>Ricoeur, Paul (1967). ''Husserl. An Analysis of His Phenomenology''. p. 33. In his \"''Ideen'' period\" (1911\u20131925) Husserl also produced two unpublished manuscripts later referred to as ''Ideen II'' and ''Ideen III''. Ric\u0153ur (1967) at 35.</ref> ''Ideen'' advanced his transition to a \"transcendental interpretation\" of phenomenology, a view later criticized by, among others, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].<ref>Jean-Paul Sartre, \"La Transcendance de L'Ego.

An existentialist theory of consciousness'' (New York: The Noonday Press 1957).

On 8 March 1916, on the battlefield of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], Wolfgang was killed in action. The next year his other son [[Gerhart Husserl]] was wounded in the war but survived. His own mother Julia died. In November 1917 one of his outstanding students and later a noted philosophy professor in his own right, [[Adolf Reinach]], was killed in the war while serving in [[Flanders]].<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" />\n\nHusserl had transferred in 1916 to the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]] ([[Freiburg im Breisgau]]) where he continued bringing his work in philosophy to fruition, now as a full professor.<ref>Peter Koestenbaum, \"Introductory Essay\" ix\u2013lxxvii, at lxxv, in Husserl, ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967).</ref> [[Edith Stein]] served as his personal assistant during his first few years in Freiburg, followed later by [[Martin Heidegger]] from 1920 to 1923. The mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]] began corresponding with him in 1918. Husserl gave four lectures on Phenomenological method at [[University College, London]] in 1922. The [[University of Berlin]] in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. In 1926 Heidegger dedicated his book ''Sein und Zeit'' (''[[Being and Time]]'') to him \"in grateful respect and friendship.\"<ref>In the 1962 translation ''Being and Time'' by Macquarrie and Robinson, Heidegger states: \"Dedicated to ''Edmund Husserl'' in friendship and admiration. Todnauberg in Baden, Black Forest, 8 April 1926\".</ref> Husserl remained in his professorship at Freiburg until he requested retirement, teaching his last class on 25 July 1928. A ''[[Festschrift]]'' to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 April 1929.\n\nDespite retirement, Husserl gave several notable lectures. The first, at Paris in 1929,<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Pariser Vortr\u00e4ge'' [1929], translated as ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967), by Peter Koestenbaum, with an \"Introductory Essay\" at ix\u2013lxxvii.</ref> led to ''[[Cartesian Meditations|M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes]]'' (Paris 1931).<ref>This work was published first in French. Husserl, ''M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes'' (Paris: Armand Colin 1931), translated by Gabrielle Peiffer and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. A German edition ''Cartesianische Meditationen'' (which Husserl had reworked) came out in 1950.</ref> Husserl here reviews the ''epoch\u00e9'' or transcendental reduction, presented earlier in his pivotal ''Ideen'' (1913), in terms of a further reduction of experience to what he calls a 'sphere of ownness.' From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts in order to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad.  This '[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental [[intersubjectivity]], which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings.  There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject.  One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the ''Cartesian Meditations'' itself becomes transcendent.

Edmund Husserl died at Freiburg on 27 April 1938, having just turned 79. His wife Malvine survived him. [[Eugen Fink]], his research assistant, delivered his [[eulogy]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ Edmund Husserl]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> [[Gerhard Ritter]] was the only Freiburg faculty member to attend the funeral, as an anti-Nazi protest.\n\n===Heidegger and the Nazi era===\nHusserl was incorrectly rumoured to have been denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation of April 1933.<ref>Hugo Ott, ''Martin Heidegger, Unterwegs zu seiner Biographie''. Campus Verlag p.168, Walter Biemel \"Erinnerungsfragmente\" in Erinnerung an Martin Heidegger Neske 1977 S.22</ref> However, among other disabilities Husserl was unable to publish his works in Nazi Germany; cf. above footnote to ''Die Krisis'' (1936). It was also rumoured that his former pupil [[Martin Heidegger]], informed Husserl that he was discharged, but it was actually the former rector.<ref>R\u00fcdiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253\u20138.</ref>\nApparently Husserl and Heidegger had moved apart during the 1920s, which became clearer after 1928 when Husserl retired and Heidegger succeeded to his University chair. In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed, e.g., Heidegger substituted ''Dasein'' [\"Being-there\"] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl. Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of [[Max Scheler]], were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various ''Kant Societies'' in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled ''Ph\u00e4nomenologie und Anthropologie''.<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971).

This was not due to a negation of the relationship between the two philosophers, however, but rather was the result of a suggested censorship by Heidegger's publisher who feared that the book might otherwise be banned by the Nazi regime.<ref name = \"mohzpp\">\"Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten\".

In post-war editions of ''Sein und Zeit'' the dedication to Husserl is restored.

There they were deposited at [[Leuven]] to form the ''Husserl-Archives'' of the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]].<ref>Cf., Peter Koestenbaum, \"Introductory Essay\" ix\u2013lxxvii, at lxxv\u2013lxxvi, in his edited Edmund Husserl, ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967).

He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects.\n\nFrom Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between ''proper'' and ''improper'' presenting. In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900\u20131901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as [[mereology]].<ref>{{citation| first=Peter | last=Simons | author-link=Peter Simons (professor) | title=Parts: A Study in Ontology | publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref>\n\nAnother important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is [[intentionality]], the notion that the main characteristic of [[consciousness]] is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of ''mental phenomena'', by which they could be distinguished from ''physical phenomena''. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the ''[[intentional object]]''). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.<ref>Chisholm, Roderick M. (1967). \"Intentionality\". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 4: 201.</ref>\n\n===The elaboration of phenomenology<!--linked from 'Michel Henry'-->===\nSome years after the 1900\u20131901 publication of his main work, the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (''Logical Investigations''), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by \"[[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called ''[[epoch\u00e9]]''. These new concepts prompted the publication of the ''Ideen'' (''Ideas'') in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the ''Logische Untersuchungen''.\n\nFrom the ''Ideen'' onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what we perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]. Husserl proposed that the world of objects\u2014and of ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects\u2014is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural standpoint\", which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them. Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \"constitute\" them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply \"external\" and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or \"type\". The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but \"bracketed\" as a way in which we regard objects{{emdash}}instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive (or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.<ref name=\"Boer1978\">{{cite book|author=Theodorus Boer|title=The Development of Husserl's Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XsudxFWboC&pg=PA121|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=31 December 1978|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-2039-2|page=121}}</ref>\n\nIn a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of [[intersubjectivity]], specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'', Meditation V). Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to scientific inquiry (and specifically to [[psychology]]) and what it means to \"bracket\" the natural attitude. ''The Crisis of the European Sciences'' is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]], emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) [[empirical]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] orientation. Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis,<ref>This assumption led Husserl to an idealistic position (which he originally had tried to overcome or avoid). On Husserl's phenomenological idealism see [[Hans K\u00f6chler]], ''Die Subjekt-Objekt-Dialektik in der transzendentalen Ph\u00e4nomenologie. Das Seinsproblem zwischen Idealismus und Realismus''.

II, 1935</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n{{Further|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}\nHusserl's thought is revolutionary in several ways, most notably in the distinction between \"natural\" and \"phenomenological\" modes of understanding. In the former, sense-perception in correspondence with the material realm constitutes the known reality, and understanding is premised on the accuracy of the perception and the objective knowability of what is called the \"real world\".<ref name=\"Keen2009\">{{cite book|author=Ralph Keen|title=Exile and Restoration in Jewish Thought: An Essay In Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZc5313lR8wC&pg=PA68|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-5308-2|page=68}}</ref> Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously \"presuppositionless\" by means of what Husserl calls \"[[phenomenological reduction]]\".<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'', tr.

Drost, 'The Primacy of Perception in Husserl's Theory of Imagining,' ''PPR 1'' (1990) 569\u201382. The German ''begreifen'', cognate with English 'grip,' carries the same sense.</ref>\n\n===Meaning and object===\nFrom ''Logical Investigations'' (1900/1901) to ''Experience and Judgment'' (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]. He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object.<ref>Burgin, M., ''Theory of Knowledge: Structures and Processes'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmptDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA468 p. 468].</ref> Examples of this are \"the victor in Jena\" and \"the loser in Waterloo\", or \"the equilateral triangle\" and \"the equiangular triangle\"; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: \"Aristotle\", \"Socrates\", and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called \"universal names\"; their meaning is a \"[[concept]]\" and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way we know sensible objects is called \"[[Noumenon|sensible intuition]]\".\n\nHusserl also identifies a series of \"formal words\" which are necessary to form [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] and have no sensible [[wikt:correlate#Noun|correlates]]. Examples of formal words are \"a\", \"the\", \"more than\", \"over\", \"under\", \"two\", \"group\", and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls \"formal categories\". There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-[[ontological]] categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[Plural|forms of plural]], among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]], [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], part and whole, relation, and so on. The way we know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called \"categorial intuition\".\n\nThrough sensible intuition our [[consciousness]] constitutes what Husserl calls a \"situation of affairs\" (''Sachlage''). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented to us. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, we are able to constitute a \"[[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]]\" (''Sachverhalt''). One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. We can use it as basis to say, \"''a''<''b''\" and \"''b''>''a''\", two judgments which designate the same state of affairs. For Husserl a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] has a [[proposition]] or [[judgment]] as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base.\n\n===Philosophy of logic and mathematics===\nHusserl believed that ''truth-in-itself'' has as [[ontology|ontological]] correlate ''being-in-itself'', just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates. [[Logic]] is a formal theory of [[belief|judgment]], that studies the formal ''a priori'' relations among judgments using meaning categories. Mathematics, on the other hand, is formal ontology; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why we do not deal with sensible objects in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called \"categorial abstraction.\" Through this faculty we are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.\n\nThanks to \"eidetic intuition\" (or \"essential intuition\"), we are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic intuition, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.\n\nHusserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that give us objective knowledge of pure logic. All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted [[noema]]tically) as it is constituted by consciousness needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness).\n\nHusserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it.\n* The first stratum is what Husserl called a \"morphology of meanings\" concerning ''a priori'' ways to relate judgments to make them meaningful. In this stratum we elaborate a \"pure grammar\" or a logical syntax, and he would call its rules \"laws to prevent non-sense\", which would be similar to what logic calls today \"[[formal language|formation rules]]\". Mathematics, as logic's ontological correlate, also has a similar stratum, a \"morphology of formal-ontological categories\".\n* The second stratum would be called by Husserl \"logic of consequence\" or the \"logic of non-contradiction\" which explores all possible forms of true judgments. He includes here syllogistic classic logic, propositional logic and that of predicates. This is a semantic stratum, and the rules of this stratum would be the \"laws to avoid counter-sense\" or \"laws to prevent contradiction\". They are very similar to today's logic \"[[formal language|transformation rules]]\". Mathematics also has a similar stratum which is based among others on pure theory of pluralities, and a pure theory of numbers. They provide a science of the conditions of possibility of any theory whatsoever. Husserl also talked about what he called \"logic of truth\" which consists of the formal laws of possible truth and its modalities, and precedes the third logical third stratum.\n* The third stratum is [[metalogic]]al, what he called a \"theory of all possible forms of theories.\" It explores all possible theories in an ''a priori'' fashion, rather than the possibility of theory in general. We could establish theories of possible relations between pure forms of theories, investigate these logical relations and the deductions from such general connection. The logician is free to see the extension of this deductive, theoretical sphere of pure logic.\n\nThe ontological correlate to the third stratum is the \"[[manifolds|theory of manifolds]]\". In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner. It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all. Through the posit of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the [[Apodicticity|apodeictic]] connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved.\n\nAccording to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s (both [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]), [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra|theory of extension]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, [[Sophus Lie]]'s theory of [[transformation groups]], and [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]].\n\n[[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to \"desedimentize\" mathematics and the mathematical sciences.<ref>See especially Klein's ''Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra'' (MIT Press, 1968).</ref>\n\n==Husserl and psychologism==\n\n===Philosophy of arithmetic and Frege===\nAfter obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the [[foundations of mathematics]] from a psychological point of view. In his [[habilitation thesis]], ''On the Concept of Number'' (1886) and in his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic (book)|Philosophy of Arithmetic]]'' (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano's descriptive psychology, to define the [[natural number]]s in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and other contemporary mathematicians. Later, in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena of Pure Logic'', Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the ''Prolegomena'' did not apply directly to his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''. Some scholars question whether Frege's negative review of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' helped turn Husserl towards [[modern Platonism]], but he had already discovered the work of [[Bernard Bolzano]] independently around 1890/91.<ref>Alfred Schramm, ''Meinongian Issues in Contemporary Italian Philosophy'', Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 28.</ref> In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, [[G. W. Leibniz]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] as inspirations for his newer position.\n\nHusserl's review of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], published before Frege's landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes [[sense]] from [[reference]]; thus Husserl's notions of [[noema]] and object also arose independently. Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'', Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept. Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by [[School of Brentano|Brentano and his school]], and may have surfaced as early as Brentano's 1870s lectures on logic.\n\nScholars such as [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty|J. N. Mohanty]], [[Claire Ortiz Hill]], and [[Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock]], among others, have argued that Husserl's so-called change from [[psychologism]] to [[Platonism]] came about independently of Frege's review.<ref>Consider [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty]], 1995, \"The Development of Husserl's Thought\" in [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and David Woodruff Smith, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Husserl'', Cambridge University Press. For further commentaries on the review, see Willard, Dallas, 1984. ''Logic and the Objectivity of Knowledge''. Athens OH: Ohio University Press, p. 63; J. Philip Miller, 1982. \"Numbers in Presence and Absence, ''Phaenomenologica 90'' (Den Haag: Nijhoff): p. 19 ff.; and [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty]], 1984, \"Husserl, Frege and the Overcoming of Psychologism\", in Cho, Kay Kyung, ed., ''Philosophy and Science in Phenomenological Perspective, Phaenomenologica 95'' (Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster: Nijhoff), p. 145.</ref>\nFor example, the review falsely accuses Husserl of subjectivizing everything, so that no objectivity is possible, and falsely attributes to him a notion of [[abstraction]] whereby objects disappear until we are left with numbers as mere ghosts. Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl's ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' we already find two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective. Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work. Frege's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass's Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives.\n\nFurthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic''. Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind\u2014that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset. He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and [[David Hume]].<ref>''Husserl-Chronik'', pp. 25\u201326</ref> Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change. In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege's ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', and again to question Frege's use of the word ''Bedeutung'' to designate \"reference\" rather than \"meaning\" (sense).\n\nIn a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' and Husserl's review of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]]'s ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik''. In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schr\u00f6der's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.\n\nCommentators argue that Husserl's notion of [[noema]] has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because ''noemata'' are necessarily fused with [[noesis|noeses]] which are the conscious activities of consciousness. ''Noemata'' have three different levels:\n* The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;\n* The ''noematic'' senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;\n* The [[Modal logic|modalities]] of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on).\nConsequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema. Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence concepts with no objects have no [[truth value]] in arguments. Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a \"state of affairs.\" Frege's notion of \"sense\" is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of \"meaning\" and \"object\" differ from those of Frege.\n\nIn detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that [[arithmetic]] could be derived from logic. For Husserl this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of [[geometry]]) is the ontological correlate of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other.\n\n===Husserl's criticism of psychologism===\nReacting against authors such as [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]], [[Christoph von Sigwart]] and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i.e. their conception of these abstract and ''a priori'' sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature. According to [[psychologism]], logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical \"art\" of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did)<ref>See the quotes in Carlo Ierna, \u201cHusserl\u2019s Critique of Double Judgments\u201d, in: Filip Mattens, editor, ''Meaning and Language: Phenomenological Perspectives'', Phaenomenologica 187 (Dordrecht/Boston/London: Springer, 2008, pp. 50 f.</ref> or a description of the factual processes of human thought. Husserl pointed out that the failure of [[Anti-psychologism|anti-psychologists]] to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side. Pure logic does not deal at all with \"thoughts\" or \"judgings\" as mental episodes but about ''a priori'' laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves.\n\n:\"Here \u2018Judgement\u2019 has the same meaning as \u2018proposition\u2019, understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning. This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic. Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions.\"<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', volume 1, edited by Dermot Moran, trans. by J.N. Findlay (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 112.</ref>\n\nSince \"truth-in-itself\" has \"being-in-itself\" as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism. Psychologists have also not been successful in showing how from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] or psychological processes we can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.\n\nThis confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as [[Biological determinism|biologism]] and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:\n\n1. The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature. Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i.e., that logic itself proposes ''a priori'' laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic. Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: If we have a formula like \"(a + b)(a \u2013 b) = a\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2\" it does not tell us how to think mathematically. It just expresses a truth. A proposition that says: \"The product of the sum and the difference of a and b ''should'' give us the difference of the squares of a and b\" does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement ''is based on'' the theoretical statement \"(a + b)(a \u2013 b) = a\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2\".\n\n2. For psychologists, the acts of judging, [[reason]]ing, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes. Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes. Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a \"met\u00e1basis eis \u00e1llo g\u00e9nos\" ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \"a transgression to another field\").{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It is a met\u00e1basis because psychology cannot possibly provide any foundations for ''a priori'' laws which themselves are the basis for all the ways we should think correctly. Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities. It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on. Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not.\n\n3. Judgments can be true or not true. Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become \"evidently\" true to us. This evidence, a psychological process that \"guarantees\" truth, is indeed a psychological process. Husserl responds by saying that truth itself, as well as logical laws, always remain valid regardless of psychological \"evidence\" that they are true. No psychological process can explain the ''a priori'' objectivity of these [[logical truth]]s.\n\nFrom this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a Platonist conception of logic. This means that we should regard logical and mathematical laws as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Grabmal Edmund Husserl Freiburg G\u00fcnterstal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Husserl's gravestone at [[Freiburg|Freiburg G\u00fcnterstal]]]]\n[[David Carr (phenomenology scholar)|David Carr]] commented on Husserl's following in his 1970 dissertation at Yale: \"It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task\" as originally intended by the radical new science.<ref>Carr, David (1970) \"Translator's Introduction\" xv\u2013xlii, at xxv, to Edmund Husserl, ''The Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology''.

From 1939 he collaborated with [[Eugen Fink]] at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy|Husserl-Archives]] in Leuven. In 1954 he became leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.\n\n[[Eugen Fink]] was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the ''Sixth Cartesian Meditation'' which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work.  Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" />\n\n[[Roman Ingarden]], an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In his ''Sp\u00f3r o istnienie \u015bwiata'' (Ger.: \"Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt\", Eng.: \"Dispute about existence of the world\") he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.\n\n[[Max Scheler]] met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at G\u00f6ttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung'' (1913). Scheler's work ''Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value'' appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler's legal troubles, and Scheler returned to [[Munich]].<ref>John Raphael Staude, ''Max Scheler'' (New York: Free Press 1967) at 19\u201320, 27\u201328.</ref> Although Scheler later criticised Husserl's idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a \"phenomenology of love\", he states that he remained \"deeply indebted\" to Husserl throughout his work.\n\n[[Nicolai Hartmann]] was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921 the prestige of Hartmann the Neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, was added to the Movement; he \"publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of ''die Ph\u00e4nomenologie''.\" Yet Hartmann's connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him as a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971). ''The Phenomenological Movement''. pp. 258\u2013259; 371 (Scheler), 379\u2013384 (use of method).</ref>\n\n[[Emmanuel Levinas]] in 1929 gave a presentation at one of Husserl's last seminars in Freiburg. Also that year he wrote on Husserl's ''Ideen'' (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl's ''M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes'' (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in [[Lithuania]]. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.<ref>Unsigned \"Preface\" at vii\u2013x, to ''Emmanuel Levinas. Basic philosophical writings'' (Indiana University 1996), edited by Adriaan Peperzak, Simon Critchley, and Robert Bernasconi.</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Schutz]]'s ''Phenomenology of the Social World'' seeks to rigorously ground [[Max Weber]]'s interpretive sociology in Husserl's phenomenology.

Sartre rejected Husserl's transcendental interpretations begun in his ''Ideen'' (1913) and instead followed Heidegger's ontology.<ref>Sartre, ''The Transcendent of the Ego. An Existentialist Theory of Consciousness'' [1937] (New York: Noonday 1957).</ref>\n\n[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' is influenced by Edmund Husserl's work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space,<ref>See, for example, the influence of Husserl on Merleau-Ponty's conception of ''l'espace'' as expounded in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \"A Phenomenological Account of the Ontological Problem of Space\", ''Existentia Meletai-Sophias'', 12 (2002), pp.345\u2013364</ref> and temporality, including Husserl's theory of [[retention and protention]]. Merleau-Ponty's description of 'motor intentionality' and sexuality, for example, retain the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of ''Ideas I'', yet further concretize what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition.  Merleau-Ponty's most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, \"the Philosopher and His Shadow.\"  Depending on the interpretation of Husserl's accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl's ''Phenomenological Psychology''<ref>Lectures, Summer Semester, 1925</ref> and ''Experience and Judgment'', it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the \"eidetic reduction\" nor the \"pure essence\" said to result.<ref>Remy C.

He expressed very strong appreciation for Husserl's work, especially with regard to \"bracketing\" or ''epoch\u00e9''.\n\n[[Hermann Weyl]]'s interest in [[intuitionistic logic]] and [[impredicativity]] appears to have resulted from his reading of Husserl.

This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after [[commercialization]] of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.\n\nElectrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[computer engineering]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[robotics]], [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]]. Many of these subdisciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics & waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more. See [[glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]].\n\nElectrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) ''(formerly the IEE)''.\n\nElectrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of electrical engineering}}\n\n[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early [[17th century]].  [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between [[magnetism]] and [[static electricity]]. He is credited with establishing the term \"electricity\".{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} He also designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] invented a device later named [[electrophorus]] that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] had developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]\nIn the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]] (the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831), and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}\n\nElectrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline.  Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int.

They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}\n\nDuring these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]] since the early electrical technology was considered [[electromechanical]] in nature. The [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt]] founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first electrical engineering degree program was started at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, {{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} though it was [[Cornell University]] to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/about/history.cfm|title=History - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Cornell Engineering|publisher=}}</ref> The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell\u2019s [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts]].<ref>https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/about/upload/Cornell-Engineering-history.pdf</ref> It was not until about 1885 that [[Cornell University|Cornell]] President [[Andrew Dickson White]] established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://president.cornell.edu/andrew-dickson-white/|title=Andrew Dickson White - Office of the President|publisher=}}</ref> In the same year, [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}</ref> Professor Mendell P.

In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts \u2014 [[direct current]] (DC) \u2014 to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky]], [[Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy]] and [[Miksa D\u00e9ri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&pg=PA1229&dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bifsUOmuLKio0AHXtIGoBg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness|date=1 January 2003|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lew5IC5piCwC&pg=PA329&dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=viTsUMiiLKWa0QHMw4HAAg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&f=false|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|first=Jeff|last=Suzuki|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|via=Google Books}}</ref> The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the ''[[War of Currents]]'' between a [[George Westinghouse]] backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.{{sfn|Severs|Leise|2011|p=145}}\n\n===More modern developments===\n[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]\nDuring the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called \"radio waves\"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these \"Hertzian waves\" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.</ref>\n\nIn 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904.

Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.\n\n===Power===\n{{Main article|Power engineering}}\n[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]\nPower engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.\n\n===Control===\n{{Main article|Control engineering|Automatic control|Control theory}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[spaceflight]].]]\n[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].\n\nControl engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}\n\n===Electronics===\n{{Main article|Electronic engineering}}\n\n[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]\nElectronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127\u20138}}</ref> The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]], and [[television|early television]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/> Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s, and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.\n\nBefore the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number\u2014often millions\u2014of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.\n\n===Microelectronics===\n{{Main article|Microelectronics}}\n[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]\n[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&nbsp;nm processing having been standard since around 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}\n\nMicroelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}\n\n===Signal processing===\n{{Main article|Signal processing}}\n[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]\n[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}\n\nSignal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics, and [[biomedical engineering]] as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.\n\nDSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital [[television set]]s,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, mobile phones, [[Portable Media Player|multimedia players]], camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, missile guidance systems, [[radar]] systems, and [[telematics]] systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for [[noise reduction]], [[speech recognition]] or [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], [[Codec|encoding or decoding]] digital media, wirelessly [[Transceiver|transmitting or receiving]] data, triangulating position using [[GPS]], and other kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]], and [[speech processing]].{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}\n\n===Telecommunications===\n{{Main article|Telecommunications engineering}}\n[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]\n[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[communication channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier signal]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.\n\nOnce the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].\n\n===Instrumentation===\n{{Main article|Instrumentation engineering}}\n[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]\n[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}\n\nOften instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.<ref>{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}</ref> For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.\n\n===Computers===\n{{Main article|Computer engineering}}\n[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]\nComputer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets, and [[supercomputers]], or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.\n\n===Related disciplines===\n[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bird VIP Infant ventilator]]\n[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]],{{sfn|Mahalik|2003|p=569}} [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]],{{sfn|Leondes|2000|p=199}} and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.\n{{sfn|Shetty|Kolk|2010|p=36}}\n''Electronic systems design'' is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.<ref name=\"lienig\">{{Cite book|author=J.

In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}\n\n[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]],{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, and [[artificial heart]]s.\n\n[[Aerospace engineering]] and [[robotics]] an example is the most recent [[electric propulsion]] and ion propulsion.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main article|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}\n[[File:Osciloscopio locomotora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oscilloscope]]]]\nElectrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering, [[electronics engineering]], [[electrical engineering technology]],<ref name=BLS3>{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineer|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4|work=[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> or electrical and electronic engineering.{{Sfn|Chaturvedi|1997|p=253}}<ref>{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&pName=corp_level1&path=education/faqs&file=faqs1.xml&xsl=generic.xsl | accessdate =20 March 2012 }}</ref> The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title.

For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]], and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}\n\n[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]\n\nA wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications, [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|p=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.<ref>{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}</ref>  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.\n\n[[File:Navy-Radome.jpg|left|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Radome]] at the Misawa Air Base Misawa Security Operations Center, Misawa, Japan]]\nFor many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].<ref>Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])</ref> Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.\n\nThe [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], onboard a [[Naval ship]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]], and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}\n\nElectrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance, the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].<ref>Huurdeman, pp.&nbsp;95\u201396</ref>  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.<ref>Huurdeman, p.90</ref>  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.<ref>Schmidt, p.218</ref><ref>Martini, p.179</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics|Engineering}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n*[[Glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]]\n*[[Outline of electrical engineering]]\n*[[Index of electrical engineering articles]]\n*[[Barnacle (slang)]]\n*[[Electrical Technologist]]\n*[[Electronic design automation]]\n*[[Information engineering (field)|Information engineering]]\n*[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC)\n*[[List of electrical engineers]]\n*[[List of Russian electrical engineers]]\n*[[Occupations in electrical/electronics engineering]]\n*[[Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering]]\n*[[List of mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing companies by revenue]]\n*[[List of engineering branches]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<cite id=\"demographics\">[[#demographics back|Note I]]</cite> - In May 2014 there were around 175,000 people working as electrical engineers in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Electrical Engineers|url = http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172071.htm|website = www.bls.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref> In 2012, Australia had around 19,000<ref>{{Cite web|title = Electrical Engineer Career Information for Migrants {{!}} Victoria, Australia|url = http://www.liveinvictoria.vic.gov.au/working-and-employment/occupations/electrical-engineer|website = www.liveinvictoria.vic.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-30|first = ; corporateName=Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources - State Government of Victoria;|last = sector=Government}}</ref> while in Canada, there were around 37,000 ({{As of|2007|lc=on}}), constituting about 0.2% of the labour force in each of the three countries.

The electromagnetic force usually exhibits [[electromagnetic field]]s such as [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s and [[light]], and is one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s (commonly called forces) in [[nature]].

Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the [[Lorentz force]], which includes both [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] as different manifestations of the same [[phenomenon]].\n\nThe electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life.  Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of [[intermolecular force]]s between individual atoms and [[molecule]]s in matter, and is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force. [[Electron]]s are bound by the electromagnetic force to [[atomic nuclei]], and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic force governs all chemical processes, which arise from interactions between the [[Molecular orbital|electrons]] of neighboring atoms.\n\nThere are numerous [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]].  In [[classical electrodynamics]], electric fields are described as [[electric potential]] and [[electric current]]. In [[Faraday law of induction|Faraday's law]], [[magnetic field]]s are associated with [[electromagnetic induction]] and magnetism, and [[Maxwell's equations]] describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.\n\nThe theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the \"medium\" of propagation ([[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]]), led to the development of [[special relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905.\n\nThe electromagnetic force is one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.  At high energy the [[weak force]] and electromagnetic force are unified as a single [[electroweak interaction|electroweak force]]. In the history of the universe, during the [[quark epoch]] the unified force broke into the two separate forces as the universe cooled.\n\n==History of the theory==\n[[File:\u00d8rsted.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]].]]\n{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory}}\n\nOriginally, electricity and magnetism were considered to be two separate forces. This view changed, however, with the publication of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1873 ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:\n# Electric charges ''{{vanchor|attract}}'' or ''{{vanchor|repel}}'' one another with a force [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract, like ones repel.\n# Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.\n# An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire.  Its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.\n# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.\n\n[[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]]]]\nWhile preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] made a surprising observation. As he was setting up his materials, he noticed a [[compass needle]] deflected away from [[magnetic north]] when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off. This deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, just as light and heat do, and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n[[File:SS-faraday.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Michael Faraday]]]]\nAt the time of discovery, \u00d8rsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[CGS]] unit of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.\n\n[[File:James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]\nHis findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in [[electrodynamics]]. They influenced French physicist [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]]'s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. \u00d8rsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.\n\nThis unification, which was observed by [[Michael Faraday]], extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and partially reformulated by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]], is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century [[mathematical physics]]. It has had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of [[light]]. Unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] are at present seen as taking the form of [[quantum|quantized]], self-propagating [[oscillation|oscillatory]] electromagnetic field disturbances called [[photon]]s. Different [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillation give rise to the different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]], from [[radio wave]]s at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to [[gamma ray]]s at the highest frequencies.\n\n\u00d8rsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear, so if current flew across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martins |first1=Roberto de Andrade |title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times |chapter=Romagnosi and Volta's Pile: Early Difficulties in the Interpretation of Voltaic Electricity |volume=vol. 3 |editors=Fabio Bevilacqua and Lucio Fregonese (eds) |publisher=Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia |pages=81\u2013102 |url=http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200951/http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap4/4.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\nAn earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson.<ref>  VIII. An account of an extraordinary effect of lightning in communicating magnetism. Communicated by Pierce Dod, M.D. F. R. S. from Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire.\nPhil. Trans. 1735 39, 74-75, published 1 January 1735 </ref> The account stated, \"A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box ...  and having placed the box in the corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder, lightning, &c.  ... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails, observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number was tried, and found\nto do the same, and that, to such a degree as to take up large nails, packing\nneedles, and other iron things of considerable weight ...\"   [[E. T. Whittaker]] suggested in 1910 that \nthis particular event was responsible for lightning to be \"credited with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of Leyden jars.\" <ref> Whittaker, E.

The other fundamental forces are:\n* the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], which binds to all known particles in the [[Standard Model]], and causes certain forms of [[radioactive decay]]. (In [[particle physics]] though, the [[electroweak interaction]] is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction);\n* the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]], which binds [[quark]]s to form [[nucleon]]s, and binds nucleons to form [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]\n* the [[gravity|gravitational force]].\nAll other forces (e.g., [[friction]], contact forces) are derived from these four fundamental forces (including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles).<ref>Browne, \"Physics for Engineering and Science,\" p 160: \"Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature. The other forces such as friction, tension, and the normal force are derived from the electric force, another of the fundamental forces. Gravity is a rather weak force... The electric force between two protons is much stronger than the gravitational force between them.\"</ref>\n\nThe electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions between [[atom]]s can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[electron]]s of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience in \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" ordinary material objects, which result from the [[intermolecular force]]s that act between the individual [[molecule]]s in our bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of [[chemistry|chemical phenomena]].\n\nA necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the [[Uncertainty principle|Pauli exclusion principle]]. The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.<ref>Purcell, \"Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd Edition,\" p 546: Ch 11 Section 6, \"Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment.\"</ref>\n\n==Classical electrodynamics==\n{{Main article|Classical electrodynamics}}\n\nIn 1600, [[ William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] proposed, in his ''[[De Magnete]]'', that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed experiments in 1752.  One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was [[Romagnosi]], who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a [[voltaic pile]] deflected a nearby [[compass]] needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when \u00d8rsted performed a similar experiment.<ref name='Oersted'>{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whmfield.html |title=Magnetic Fields -- History |accessdate=2009-11-27 |last=Stern |first=Dr. David P. |first2=Mauricio |last2=Peredo |date=2001-11-25 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center }}</ref> \u00d8rsted's work influenced Amp\u00e8re to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.\n\nA theory of electromagnetism, known as [[classical electromagnetism]], was developed by various physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it culminated in the publication of a [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|treatise]] by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], which unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light.<ref>Purcell, p 436. Chapter 9.3, \"Maxwell's description of the electromagnetic field was essentially complete.\"</ref> In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]], and the electromagnetic force is given by the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]].<ref>Purcell: p 278: Chapter 6.1, \"Definition of the Magnetic Field.\" Lorentz force and force equation.</ref>\n\nOne of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with [[classical mechanics]], but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the [[Permittivity|electrical permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability]] of [[free space]]. This violates [[Galilean invariance]], a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a [[luminiferous aether]] through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see [[History of special relativity]].)\n\nIn addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term \"electromagnetism\". (For more information, see [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity]] and [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]].)\n\n==Chaotic and emergent phenomena==\n{{Beyond the Standard Model}}\n{{see also|Chaos Theory|Emergence|Self-organization}}\nThe mathematical models used in [[classical electromagnetism]], [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and the [[standard model]] all view the electromagnetic force as a linear set of equations. In these theories electromagnetism is a U(1) gauge theory, whose topological properties do not allow any complex nonlinear interaction of a field with and on itself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Terence W.|title=Topological Foundations of Electromagnetism|date=2008|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-277-997-7|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e0-QdLqT-pIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Terence+W.+Barrett%22#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> For example, in the [[QED vacuum]] the field fluctuates randomly as a consequence of the [[uncertainty principle]] but these fluctuations cancel each other out with no overall observable effect.

As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.\n\n{{SI electromagnetism units}}\n\nFormulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit \"sub-systems\", including [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], \"ESU\", \"EMU\", and [[Heaviside\u2013Lorentz]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase \"CGS units\" is often used to refer specifically to [[Gaussian units|CGS-Gaussian units]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electromagnetism}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force]]\n* [[Aeromagnetic survey]]s\n* [[Computational electromagnetics]]\n* [[Double-slit experiment]]\n* [[Electromagnet]]\n* [[Electromagnetic induction]]\n* [[Electromagnetic wave equation]]\n* [[Electromechanics]]\n* [[Geophysics]]\n* [[Magnetostatics]]\n* [[Magnetoquasistatic field]]\n* [[Optics]]\n* [[Relativistic electromagnetism]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Web sources ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web\n  | last = Nave\n  | first = R.\n  | title = Electricity and magnetism\n  | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/emcon.html#emcon\n  | website=HyperPhysics\n  | publisher=Georgia State University\n  | accessdate = 2013-11-12\n  | postscript = <!--None--> }}\n* {{cite web\n  | last = Khutoryansky\n  | first = E.\n  | title = Electromagnetism - Maxwell's Laws \n  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tm2c6NJH4Y\n  | accessdate = 2014-12-28\n  | postscript = <!--None--> }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n===Textbooks===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=Electricity and Modern Physics |edition=2nd|author=G.A.G.

Modifications include:\n* Shortening or \"clipping\" the term, such as ''Jeez'' (Jesus) and ''what the\u2014'' (\"what the hell\")\n* Mispronunciations, such as ''[[Frak (expletive)|frak]]'', ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]'' (both the preceding for \"fuck\"), ''what the fudge'', ''what the truck'' (both \"what the fuck\"), ''oh my gosh'' (\"oh my God\"), ''frickin'' (\"fucking\"), ''darn'' (\"damn\"), ''oh shoot'' (\"oh shit\"), ''be-yotch'' (\"bitch\"), etc. This is also referred to as a [[minced oath]].\n* Using first letters as replacements, such as ''SOB'' (\"son of a bitch\"), ''what the eff'' (\"what the fuck\"), ''S my D'' (\"suck my dick\"), ''BS'' (\"bullshit\"). Sometimes, the word \"word\" is added after it, such as ''F-word'' (\"fuck\"), ''S-word'' (\"shit\"), ''B-word'' (\"bitch\"), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled. For example, the word ''piss'' was shortened to ''pee'' (pronounced as the letter ''P'') in this way.\n\n===Figures of speech===\n* [[Ambiguous]] statements (''it'' for excrement, ''the situation'' or ''a girl in trouble'' for pregnancy, ''passing away'' or ''passed'' or ''go'' for death, ''do it'' or ''come together'' in reference to a [[Sexual intercourse#In humans|sexual act]], ''[[tired and emotional]]'' for drunkenness)\n* [[Understatement]]s (''asleep'' for dead, ''drinking'' for consuming alcohol, ''hurt'' for injured, etc.)\n* [[Metaphor]]s (''beat the meat'' or ''choke the chicken'' or ''jerkin' the gherkin'' for [[masturbation]], ''take a dump'' and ''take a leak'' for defecation and urination respectively)\n* Comparisons (''buns'' for buttocks, ''weed'' for cannabis)\n* [[Metonymy]] (''men's room'' for \"men's toilet\")\n\n===Rhetoric===\nEuphemism may be used as a [[Rhetorical strategies|rhetorical strategy]], in which case its goal is to change the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of a description from positive to negative.\n\n===Slang===\n{{see also|Slang}}\nThe use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, ''screwed up'' is a euphemism for ''fucked up''; ''hook-up'' and ''laid'' are euphemisms for [[sexual intercourse]].\n\nThere is some disagreement over whether certain terms are or are not euphemisms. For example, sometimes the phrase ''visually impaired'' is labeled as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] euphemism for ''blind'' or a blind person. However, ''[[visual impairment]]'' can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word ''blind''.\n\n===Words from a foreign language===\nExpressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word ''enceinte'' was sometimes used instead of the English word ''pregnant''.<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite web|title=Definition of ENCEINTE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enceinte|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=2017-05-20|language=en}}</ref> This practice of word substitution became so frequent that the expression \"''[[pardon my French]]''\" was adopted in attempts to excuse the use of profanity.\n\n===Evolution===<!-- [[Euphemism treadmill]] redirects here. -->\nEuphemisms may be formed in a number of ways. [[Periphrasis]], or [[circumlocution]], is one of the most common: to \"speak around\" a given word, [[Implicature|implying]] it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.\n\nTo alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a [[swear word]]) to form a euphemism is known as ''taboo deformation'', or a [[minced oath]]. In [[American English]], words that are unacceptable on television, such as ''[[fuck]]'', may be represented by deformations such as ''freak'', even in children's cartoons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |work=FCC.gov |accessdate=2014-01-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=no}}</ref>.

It is a [[portmanteau]] of the terms ''[[Newspeak]]'' and ''[[doublethink]]'', which originate from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.\n\nThe word ''euphemism'' itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (see [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of ''euphemism'' also occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, \"Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?\"\n\nIn Wes Anderson's film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', the replacement of swear words by the word ''cuss'' became a humorous motif throughout the film.\n\nIn [[Tom Hanks]]'s web series ''[[Electric City (web series)|Electric City]]'', the use of profanity has been censored by the word ''expletive''. \"[[Expletive deleted|&#91;Expletive deleted&#93;]]\" entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the [[Watergate tapes]].\n\nIn [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], the curses of the scientist [[Ebling Mis]] have all been replaced with the word ''unprintable''. In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's.

Raleigh acquired other nearby Munster estates confiscated in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]].  Some time between 1587 and 1589, Spenser acquired his main estate at Kilcolman, near Doneraile in North Cork.<ref>Hadfield, pp200-01</ref> He later bought a second holding to the south, at Rennie, on a rock overlooking the river [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]] in North Cork. Its ruins are still visible today. A short distance away grew a tree, locally known as \"Spenser's Oak\" until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the 1960s. Local legend has it that he penned some of ''The Faerie Queene'' under this tree.<ref>Hadfield, p362</ref>\n\nIn 1590, Spenser brought out the first three books of his most famous work, ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', having travelled to London to publish and promote the work, with the likely assistance of Raleigh.  He was successful enough to obtain a life pension of \u00a350 a year from the Queen.  He probably hoped to secure a place at court through his poetry, but his next significant publication boldly antagonised the queen's principal secretary, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley (William Cecil)]], through its inclusion of the satirical ''[[Mother Hubberd's Tale]]''.<ref>Hadfield, p165</ref> He returned to Ireland.\n\nBy 1594, Spenser's first wife had died, and in that year he married Elizabeth Boyle, who was much younger than him, and  originated from Northamptonshire, possibly his native county.  He addressed to her the sonnet sequence ''[[Amoretti]]''.  The marriage itself was celebrated in ''[[Epithalamion (poem)|Epithalamion]]''.<ref>Hadfield, pp296, 301, 323</ref> They had a son named Peregrine.<ref name=\"westminster-abbey.org\"/>\n\nIn 1596, Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled ''A View of the Present State of Ireland''. This piece, in the form of a dialogue, circulated in manuscript, remaining unpublished until the mid-seventeenth century. It is probable that it was kept out of print during the author's lifetime because of its inflammatory content. The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally \"pacified\" by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed, if necessary by violence.<ref>Hadfield, pp 334\u201343, 365</ref>\n\nIn 1598, during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]], Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of [[Hugh \u00d3 Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Aodh \u00d3 N\u00e9ill]]. His castle at Kilcolman was burned, and [[Ben Jonson]], who may have had private information, asserted that one of his infant children died in the blaze.<ref>Hadfield, p 362</ref> \n[[File:Fowre Hymnes by Edmund Spenser 1596.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Title page]], ''Fowre Hymnes'', by Edmund Spenser, published by [[William Ponsonby (publisher)|William Ponsonby]], London, 1596]]\n\nIn the year after being driven from his home, 1599, Spenser travelled to London, where he died at the age of forty-six \u2013 \"for want of bread\", according to [[Ben Jonson]] \u2013 one of Jonson's more doubtful statements, since Spenser had a payment to him authorised by the government and was due his pension.<ref>Hadfield pp 391 - 393</ref> His coffin was carried to his grave in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]] by other poets, who threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave with many tears.  His second wife survived him and remarried twice. His sister Sarah, who had accompanied him to Ireland, married into the Travers family, and her descendants were prominent landowners in Cork for centuries.\n\n==Rhyme and reason==\n[[Thomas Fuller]], in ''Worthies of England'', included a story where the Queen told her treasurer, William Cecil, to pay Spenser one hundred pounds for his poetry. The treasurer, however, objected that the sum was too much. She said, \"Then give him what is reason\". Without receiving his payment in due time, Spenser gave the Queen this [[quatrain]] on one of her progresses:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nI was promis'd on a time,\nTo have a reason for my rhyme:\nFrom that time unto this season,\nI receiv'd nor rhyme nor reason.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nShe immediately ordered the treasurer pay Spenser the original \u00a3100.\n\nThis story seems to have attached itself to Spenser from [[Thomas Churchyard]], who apparently had difficulty in getting payment of his pension, the only other pension Elizabeth awarded to a poet.  Spenser seems to have had no difficulty in receiving payment when it was due as the pension was being collected for him by his publisher, Ponsonby.<ref>Hadfield pp 5 & 236</ref>\n\n==''The Shepherd's Calendar''==\n{{main|The Shepherd's Calendar}}\n[[File:Title Page of a 1617 Edition of The Shepherd's Calendar.jpg|thumb|Title Page of a 1617 Edition of ''The Shepherd's Calendar'' printed by Matthew Lownes, often bound with the complete works printed in 1611 or 1617.]]\n''[[The Shepherd's Calendar]]'' is Edmund Spenser's first major work, which appeared in 1579.

In Spenser's \"A Letter of the Authors,\" he states that the entire epic poem is \"cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devises,\" and that the aim behind ''The Faerie Queene'' was to \"fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline.\u201d<ref>Spenser, Edmund (1984), \"A Letter of the Authors Expounding His Whole Intention in the Course of the Worke: Which for That It Giueth Great Light to the Reader, for the Better Vnderstanding Is Hereunto Annexed\", in Roche, Thomas P., Jr, ''The Fairy Queene'', New York: Penguin, pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\n==Shorter poems==\nSpenser published numerous relatively short poems in the last decade of the sixteenth century, almost all of which consider love or sorrow. In 1591, he published ''[[Complaints (poetry collection)|Complaints]]'', a collection of poems that express complaints in mournful or mocking tones. Four years later, in 1595, Spenser published ''Amoretti and Epithalamion''. This volume contains eighty-nine sonnets commemorating his courtship of Elizabeth Boyle. In \"[[Amoretti]],\" Spenser uses subtle humour and parody while praising his beloved, reworking Petrarchism in his treatment of longing for a woman. \"[[Epithalamion (poem)|Epithalamion]],\" similar to \"[[Amoretti]],\" deals in part with the unease in the development of a romantic and sexual relationship. It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle. Some have speculated that the attention to disquiet in general reflects Spenser's personal anxieties at the time, as he was unable to complete his most significant work, ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. In the following year Spenser released ''[[Prothalamion]]'', a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke, allegedly in hopes to gain favour in the court.<ref>Prescott, Anne. \"Spenser's shorter poems.\" ''The Cambridge Companion to Spenser''.

Print.</ref>\n\n==The Spenserian stanza and sonnet==\nSpenser used a distinctive verse form, called the [[Spenserian stanza]], in several works, including ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. The stanza's main meter is [[iambic pentameter]] with a final line in [[iambic hexameter]] (having six feet or stresses, known as an [[Alexandrine]]), and the rhyme scheme is ababbcbcc.<ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/glossary-terms/detail/spenserian-stanza Spenserian stanza at Poetry Foundation.]</ref> He also used his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet. In a Spenserian sonnet, the last line of every quatrain is linked with the first line of the next one, yielding the rhyme scheme ababbcbccdcdee.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Influences==\nThough Spenser was well read in classical literature, scholars have noted that his poetry does not rehash tradition, but rather is distinctly his. This individuality may have resulted, to some extent, from a lack of comprehension of the classics. Spenser strove to emulate such ancient Roman poets as [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]], whom he studied during his schooling, but many of his best-known works are notably divergent from those of his predecessors.<ref>Burrow, Colin. \"Spenser and classical traditions.\" ''The Cambridge Companion to Spenser''. Ed. Andrew Hadfield. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 217\u2013236. Print.</ref> The language of his poetry is purposely archaic, reminiscent of earlier works such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'' of [[Francesco Petrarca]], whom Spenser greatly admired.\n\nAn Anglican<ref>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/edmund-spenser</ref> and a devotee of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, Spenser was particularly offended by the anti-Elizabethan propaganda that some Catholics circulated. Like most Protestants near the time of the Reformation, Spenser saw a Catholic church full of corruption, and he determined that it was not only the wrong religion but the anti-religion. This sentiment is an important backdrop for the battles of The Faerie Queene.<ref>http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/fqueen/context/</ref>\n\nSpenser was called \"the Poet's Poet\" by Charles Lamb<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alpers |first1=Paul |year=1990 |chapter=Poet's poet, the |editor1-last=Henderson |editor1-first=A.

Among his contemporaries [[Walter Raleigh]] wrote a commendatory poem to ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in 1590, in which he claims to admire and value Spenser's work more so than any other in the English language. John Milton in his ''[[Areopagitica]]'' mentions \"our sage and serious poet Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than [[Duns Scotus|Scotus]] or [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]\".<ref>Milton, John. [[s:Areopagitica|''Areopagitica'']].</ref>  In the eighteenth century, [[Alexander Pope]] compared Spenser to \"a mistress, whose faults we see, but love her with them all.\"<ref>Elliott, John, ed.

Print.</ref>\n\n==''A View of the Present State of Ireland''==\nIn his work ''A View of the Present State of Irelande'' (1596), Spenser discussed future plans to [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|subjugate Ireland]], the most recent rising, led by [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], having demonstrated the futility of previous efforts. The work is partly a defence of [[Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton]], who was appointed [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] in 1580, and who greatly influenced Spenser's thinking on Ireland.\n\nThe goal of this piece was to show that Ireland was in great need of reform. Spenser believed that \"Ireland is a diseased portion of the State, it must first be cured and reformed, before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation\".<ref>Henley 178</ref> In ''A View of the Present State of Ireland'', Spenser categorises the \u201cevils\u201d of the Irish people into three prominent categories:  laws, customs, and religion.  These three elements work together in creating the disruptive and degraded people. One example given in the work is the native law system called \"[[Brehon Law]]\" which trumps the established law given by the English monarchy. This system has its own court and way of dealing with infractions. It has been passed down through the generations and Spenser views this system as a native backward custom which must be destroyed. (Brehon Law methods of dealing with murder by imposing an ''[[\u00e9raic]]'', or fine, on the murderer's whole family particularly horrified the English, in whose Protestant view a murderer should die for his act.)\n\nSpenser wished devoutly that the [[Irish language]] should be eradicated, writing that if children learn Irish before English, \"Soe that the speach being Irish, the hart must needes be Irishe; for out of the aboundance of the hart, the tonge speaketh\".<ref name=\"ucc.ie\">http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E500000-001/</ref>\n\nHe pressed for a [[scorched earth]] policy in Ireland, noting that the destruction of crops and animals had been successful in crushing the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]] (1579\u201383), when, despite the rich and bountiful land:\n\n<blockquote>\"'Out of everye corner of the woode and glenns they came creepinge forth upon theire handes, for theire legges could not beare them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spake like ghostes, crying out of theire graves; they did eate of the carrions, happye wheare they could find them, yea, and one another soone after, in soe much as the verye carcasses they spared not to scrape out of theire graves; and if they found a plott of water-cresses or shamrockes, theyr they flocked as to a feast\u2026 in a shorte space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentyfull countrye suddenly lefte voyde of man or beast: yett sure in all that warr, there perished not manye by the sworde, but all by the extreamytie of famine ... they themselves had wrought'\"<ref name=\"ucc.ie\"/></blockquote>\n\n==List of works==\n* ''Iambicum Trimetrum''\n* 1569: Jan van der Noodt's ''A Theatre for Worldlings'', including poems translated into English by Spenser from French sources, published by Henry Bynneman in London<ref name=cufeesb>Web page titled [http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/spenser/biography.htm \"Edmund Spenser Home Page/Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102013123/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/spenser/biography.htm |date=2 January 2012 }}, \"Chronology\" section (at bottom of Chronology, Web page states: \"Source: adapted from [[Willy Maley]], ''A Spenser Chronology.''\"), at the website of the University of Cambridge Faculty of English website, retrieved 24 September 2009</ref>\n* 1579: ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'', published under the pseudonym \"Immerito\"<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}</ref> (entered into the Stationers' Register in December<ref name=cufeesb/>)\n\n1590:\n*''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', Books 1\u20133\n\n1591:\n* ''[[Complaints, Containing Sundrie Small Poemes of the Worlds Vanitie]]'' (entered into the Stationer's Register in 1590<ref name=cufeesb/>), includes:\n** \"The Ruines of Time\"\n** \"The Teares of the Muses\"\n** \"Virgil's Gnat\"\n** \"Prosopopoia, or Mother Hubberds Tale\"\n** \"Ruines of Rome: by [[Joachim du Bellay|Bellay]]\"\n** \"Muiopotmos, or the Fate of the Butterflie\"\n** \"Visions of the Worlds Vanitie\"\n** \"The Visions of [[Joachim du Bellay|Bellay]]\"\n** \"The Visions of [[Petrarch]]\"\n\n1592:\n* ''Axiochus'', a translation of a pseudo-Platonic dialogue from the original [[Ancient Greek poetry|Ancient Greek]]; published by Cuthbert Burbie; attributed to \"Edw: Spenser\"<ref name=cufeesb/> but the attribution is uncertain<ref>Hadfield, Andrew, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kc__ztz7j0UC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''The Cambridge Companion to Spenser''], \"Chronology\", Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-521-64199-3}}, p xix, retrieved via Google Books, 24 September 2009</ref>\n* ''Daphna\u00efda.

For [[electric utility|electric utilities]] in the [[electric power industry]], it is the first stage in the delivery of electricity to end users, the other stages being [[Electric power transmission|transmission]], [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], [[energy storage]] and recovery, using [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] method].\n\nA characteristic of electricity is that it is not a primary energy freely present in nature in remarkable amounts and it must be produced. Production is carried out in [[power plant]]s. Electricity is most often generated at a [[power station]] by [[electromechanical]] [[electric generator|generators]], primarily driven by [[heat engine]]s fueled by [[combustion]] or [[nuclear fission]] but also by other means such as the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar [[photovoltaics]] and [[geothermal power]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Electricity production in the World.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Electricity production in the World, 1980-2013]]\nThe fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist [[Michael Faraday]]. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or [[Faraday disc|disc of copper]] between the poles of a [[magnet]]. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of [[alternating current]] (AC) power transmission, using power [[transformer]]s to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.\n\nIn 1870, commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. In 1870, the mechanical production of electric power began the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and created inventions using the energy, whose major contributors were [[Thomas Alva Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the [[telegraph]].\n\nElectricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a [[steam engine]] driving a dynamo at [[Pearl Street Station]] produced a [[DC current]] that powered public lighting on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]], [[New York City|New York]]. The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adopted their gas fueled street lights to electric power, and soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains.\n\nThe first power plants used water power or coal;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ethw.org/Pearl_Street_Station|title=Pearl Street Station - Engineering and Technology History Wiki|website=ethw.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> and today a variety of energy sources are used, such as [[coal]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[natural gas]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[wind generator]]s, and [[oil]], as well as [[solar energy]], [[tidal power]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] sources. The use of power-lines and power-poles have been significantly important in the distribution of electricity.\n\n== Methods of generating electricity ==\n{{Latest pie chart of world power by source}}\n[[File:U.S. 2014 Electricity Generation By Type.png|thumb|U.S. 2014 Electricity Generation By Type.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_01|title=EIA - Electricity Data|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Sources of Electricity in France in 2006.PNG|thumb|300px|Sources of electricity in France in 2006;<ref>{{cite web |author=DGEMP / Observatoire de l'\u00e9nergie|date=April 2007|url=http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/energie/statisti/pdf/elec-analyse-stat.pdf|title=L\u2019Electricit\u00e9 en France en 2006 : une analyse statistique.|accessdate=2007-05-23|format=PDF|language=fr}}</ref> [[nuclear power]] was the main source.]]\n\nSeveral fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. The [[triboelectric effect]], [[piezoelectric effect]], and even direct capture of the energy of nuclear decay [[Betavoltaics]] are used in niche applications, as is direct conversion of heat to electric power in the [[thermoelectric effect]]. Utility-scale generation is done by rotating electric generators, or by photovoltaic systems.  A very small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries.\n\n=== Generators ===\n[[Electric generator]]s transform [[kinetic energy]] into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]. It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of a conducting material (e.g. copper wire). Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which [[mechanical energy]] forces a generator to rotate:\n\n=== Electrochemistry ===\n[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Hoover Dam]] can provide large amounts of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power; it has 2.07 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]][[Electrochemistry]] is the direct transformation of [[chemical energy]] into electricity, as in a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries.<ref>[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/archive.cfm/pubDate=%7Bd%20'2003-09-24'%7D#6490 World's Largest Utility Battery System Installed in Alaska] (press release, 2003-09-24), U.S. Department of Energy. ''\"13,670 nickel-cadmium battery cells to generate up to 40 megawatts of power for about 7 minutes, or 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes.\"''</ref> [[Primary cell]]s, such as the common [[Zinc\u2013carbon battery|zinc\u2013carbon batteries]], act as power sources directly, but [[secondary cell]]s (i.e. rechargeable batteries) are used for [[electricity storage|storage]] systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as [[fuel cell]]s, can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. [[Osmotic power]] is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges.\n\n=== Photovoltaic effect ===\nThe [[photovoltaic effect]] is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in [[solar cell]]s. [[Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic panels]] convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant, [[solar power]] electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems.<ref>[http://www.doe.gov/news/4503.htm ''New World Record Achieved in Solar Cell Technology''] (press release, 2006-12-05), U.S. Department of Energy.</ref> Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, and the United States.\n\n[[File:Turbine aalborg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Wind turbine]]s usually provide electrical generation in conjunction with other methods of producing power.]]\n\n== Economics of generation and production of electricity ==\n{{see also|Cost of electricity by source}}\nThe selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in widespread selling prices, e.g. the price in Venezuela is 3 cents per kWh while in Denmark it is 40 cents per kWh. [[Hydroelectric plant]]s, [[nuclear power plant]]s, [[thermal power plant]]s and [[renewable source]]s have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load, supplied by plants which run continuously.  Nuclear, coal, oil and gas plants can supply base load.\n\n[[Thermal energy]] is economical in areas of high industrial density, as the high demand cannot be met by renewable sources. The effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas. These plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units.\nNuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, recent disasters in Japan have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high.\nHydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It is not an economically viable source of production where the load varies too much during the annual production cycle and the ability to store the flow of water is limited.\n\nDue to advancements in technology, and with mass production, renewable sources other than hydroelectricity (solar power, wind energy, tidal power, etc.) experienced decreases in cost of production, and the energy is now in many cases cost-comparative with fossil fuels. Many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production, and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible. However, their use is frequently limited by their [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent nature]].\nIf natural gas prices are below $3 per million [[British thermal unit]]s, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2013/03/22/will-natural-gas-stay-cheap-enough-replace-coal-and-lower-us-carbon-emissions/ | work=Forbes | first=Karl | last=Smith| title= Will Natural Gas Stay Cheap Enough To Replace Coal And Lower Us Carbon Emissions| date= 22 March 2013| accessdate= 20 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Generating equipment==\n=== Turbines ===\nAlmost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a [[turbine]], driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including [[heat engine]]s, hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by [[heat engine]]s. The combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from [[nuclear fission]] and some from [[renewable source]]s. The modern [[steam turbine]] (invented by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] in 1884) currently generates about 80% of the [[electric power]] in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include:\n*Steam [[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China can provide large amounts of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power; it has a 22.5 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]]\n** Water is boiled by [[coal]] burned in a [[Fossil-fuel power station|thermal power plant]], about 41% of all electricity is generated this way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/coal-electricity|title=Coal & electricity|website=World Coal Association|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref>\n** [[Nuclear fission]] heat created in a [[nuclear reactor]] creates steam. Less than 15% of electricity is generated this way.\n**Renewables. The steam is generated by [[Biomass]], [[Solar thermal energy]] where [[solar parabolic trough]]s and [[solar power tower]]s concentrate sunlight to heat a heat transfer fluid, which is then used to produce steam, or [[Geothermal power]].\n*Natural gas: turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion. [[Combined cycle]] are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a [[gas turbine]] and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20% of the worlds electricity is generated by natural gas.\n*Water Energy is captured from the movement of water. From falling water, the rise and fall of tides or [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean thermal currents]]. Each driving a [[water turbine]] to produce approximately 16% of the world's electricity.\n*The [[windmill]] was a very early [[wind turbine]]. In a [[solar updraft tower]] wind is artificially produced. Before 2010 less than 2% of the worlds electricity was produced from wind.\nAlthough turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by [[gasoline]] or [[diesel engine]]s. These may used for back up generation or isolated villages.\n\n===Generators===\n[[File:Stator winding at WPS.JPG|thumb|center|upright=2.0|A large generator with the rotor removed]]\n{{main|Electric generator}}\nElectric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of the [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] of electric current in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity. A very large 2000 MW(2,682,000 horsepower) unit designed by Siemens was built for unit 3 at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant.<ref>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5075247/?reload=true&arnumber=5075247&queryText%3D2000%20mw%20generator&tp=</ref> The only commercial scale electricity production that does not employ a generator is solar PV.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Update|section|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe production of electricity in 2013 was 23,322TWh.  Sources of electricity were coal and peat 41%, natural gas 22%, hydroelectric 16%, nuclear power 11%, oil 4%, biomass and waste 2% and other sources 4%.  Other sources include wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, and solar thermal.<ref>{{cite web|title=OECD Factbook 2015-2016: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-factbook-2015-2016/world-electricity-generation-by-source-of-energy_factbook-2015-graph86-en|date=8 April 2016|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref>\n<!-- 8.76582 TWh/year = 1 GW -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|+ Source of Electricity (World total year 2008)\n|-\n! - !!

The term is generally associated with [[experiments]] in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to the design of [[quasi-experiment]]s, in which [[naturalistic observation|natural]] conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.\n\nIn its simplest form, an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions, which is represented by one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]], also referred to as \"input variables\" or \"predictor variables.\" The change in one or more independent variables is generally hypothesized to result in a change in one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]], also referred to as \"output variables\" or \"response variables.\" The experimental design may also identify [[controlling for a variable|control variables]] that must be held constant to prevent external factors from affecting the results. Experimental design involves not only the selection of suitable independent, dependent, and control variables, but planning the delivery of the experiment under statistically optimal conditions given the constraints of available resources.  There are multiple approaches for determining the set of design points (unique combinations of the settings of the independent variables) to be used in the experiment.\n\nMain concerns in experimental design include the establishment of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[Reproducibility|replicability]]. For example, these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the independent variable, reducing the risk of measurement error, and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of [[statistical power]] and [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]].\n\nCorrectly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering. Other applications include marketing and policy making.\n\n==History==\n\n===Systematic clinical trials===\n{{original research|section|date=September 2015}}\n{{primary sources|section|date=September 2015}}\nIn 1747, while serving as surgeon on [[HMS Salisbury (1746)|HMS ''Salisbury'']], [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]] carried out a systematic clinical trial to compare remedies for [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"ADC1997\">{{Cite journal| last =Dunn | first =Peter | title =James Lind (1716-94) of Edinburgh and the treatment of scurvy  | journal =Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition | volume =76 | issue = 1| pages =64\u201365 | publisher =British Medical Journal Publishing Group | location =United Kingdom |date = January 1997| url =http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/76/1/F64 | doi = 10.1136/fn.76.1.F64| pmc =1720613 | accessdate =2009-01-17 | pmid=9059193}}</ref> This systematic clinical trial constitutes a type of DOE.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{dubious|date=September 2015}}\n\nLind selected 12 men from the ship, all suffering from scurvy. Lind limited his subjects to men who \"were as similar as I could have them,\" that is, he provided strict entry requirements to reduce extraneous variation. He divided them into six pairs, giving each pair  different supplements to their basic diet for two weeks. The treatments were all remedies that had been proposed:\n*   A quart of cider every day.\n*   Twenty five gutts (drops) of [[vitriol]] (sulphuric acid) three times a day upon an empty stomach.\n*   One half-pint of seawater every day.\n*   A mixture of garlic, mustard, and horseradish in a lump the size of a nutmeg.\n*   Two spoonfuls of vinegar three times a day.\n*   Two oranges and one lemon every day.\n\nThe citrus treatment stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one (cider) showed some effect of its treatment.  The remainder of the crew presumably served as a control, but Lind did not report results from any control (untreated) group.\n\n===Statistical experiments, following Charles S.

Much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods.  As a mundane example, he described how to test the [[lady tasting tea]] [[hypothesis]], that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. These methods have been broadly adapted in the physical and social sciences, are still used in [[agricultural engineering]] and differ from the design and analysis of [[computer experiment]]s.\n\n;Comparison\n:In some fields of study it is not possible to have independent measurements to a traceable [[Standard (metrology)|metrology standard]].  Comparisons between treatments are much more valuable and are usually preferable, and often compared against a [[scientific control]] or traditional treatment that acts as baseline.\n\n;[[Randomization]]\n:Random assignment is the process of assigning individuals at random to groups or to different groups in an experiment, so that each individual of the population has the same chance of becoming a participant in the study. The random assignment of individuals to groups (or conditions within a group) distinguishes a rigorous, \"true\" experiment from an observational study or \"quasi-experiment\".<ref>Creswell, J.W. (2008), ''Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd edition)'', Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}</ref> There is an extensive body of mathematical theory that explores the consequences of making the allocation of units to treatments by means of some random mechanism (such as tables of random numbers, or the use of randomization devices such as playing cards or dice). Assigning units to treatments at random tends to mitigate [[confounding]], which makes effects due to factors other than the treatment to appear to result from the treatment.\n\n:The risks associated with random allocation (such as having a serious imbalance in a key characteristic between a treatment group and a control group) are calculable and hence can be managed down to an acceptable level by using enough experimental units. However, if the population is divided into several subpopulations that somehow differ, and the research requires each subpopulation to be equal in size, stratified sampling can be used. In that way, the units in each subpopulation are randomized, but not the whole sample. The results of an experiment can be generalized reliably from the experimental units to a larger [[statistical population]] of units only if the experimental units are a [[Sampling (statistics)|random sample]] from the larger population; the probable error of such an extrapolation depends on the sample size, among other things.\n\n;[[Replication (statistics)|Statistical replication]]\n:Measurements are usually subject to variation and [[measurement uncertainty]]; thus they are repeated and full experiments are replicated to help identify the sources of variation, to better estimate the true effects of treatments, to further strengthen the experiment's reliability and validity, and to add to the existing knowledge of the topic.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dr. Hani|title=Replication study|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/replication-study.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|year=2009}}</ref> However, certain conditions must be met before the replication of the experiment is commenced: the original research question has been published in a [[peer-review]]ed journal or widely cited, the researcher is independent of the original experiment, the researcher must first try to replicate the original findings using the original data, and the write-up should state that the study conducted is a replication study that tried to follow the original study as strictly as possible.<ref>{{citation|last=Burman|first=Leonard E.|title=A call for replication studies|url=http://pfr.sagepub.com|journal=[[Public Finance Review]] | volume=38 |accessdate=27 October 2011|author2=Robert W.

Blocking reduces known but irrelevant sources of variation between units and thus allows greater precision in the estimation of the source of variation under study.\n\n;[[Orthogonality#Statistics.2C econometrics.2C and economics|Orthogonality]]\n[[File:Factorial Design.svg|thumb|Example of orthogonal factorial design]]\n:Orthogonality concerns the forms of comparison (contrasts) that can be legitimately and efficiently carried out. Contrasts can be represented by vectors and sets of orthogonal contrasts are uncorrelated and independently distributed if the data are normal. Because of this independence, each orthogonal treatment provides different information to the others. If there are ''T'' treatments and ''T'' \u2013 1 orthogonal contrasts, all the information that can be captured from the experiment is obtainable from the set of contrasts.\n\n;[[Factorial experiment]]s\n:Use of factorial experiments instead of the one-factor-at-a-time method.  These are efficient at evaluating the effects and possible [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] of several factors (independent variables). Analysis of [[experiment]] design is built on the foundation of the [[analysis of variance]], a collection of models that partition the observed variance into components, according to what factors the experiment must estimate or test.\n\n==Example==\n[[File:Balance \u00e0 tabac 1850.JPG|right|240px]]\nThis example is attributed to [[Harold Hotelling]].<ref name=\"ref3\">[[Herman Chernoff]], ''Sequential Analysis and Optimal Design'', [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] Monograph, 1972.</ref>  It conveys some of the flavor of those aspects of the subject that involve combinatorial designs.\n\nWeights of eight objects are measured using a [[pan balance]] and set of standard weights.  Each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan vs. any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium. Each measurement has a [[errors and residuals in statistics|random error]].  The average error is zero; the [[standard deviation]]s of the [[probability distribution]] of the errors is the same number \u03c3 on different weighings; errors on different weighings are [[statistical independence|independent]].  Denote the true weights by\n\n:<math>\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_8.\\,</math>\n\nWe consider two different experiments:\n\n# Weigh each object in one pan, with the other pan empty.  Let ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> be the measured weight of the object, for ''i'' = 1, ..., 8.\n# Do the eight weighings according to the following schedule and let ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> be the measured difference for ''i'' = 1, ..., 8:\n\n:: <math>\n\\begin{array}{lcc}\n& \\text{left pan} & \\text{right pan} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{1st weighing:} & 1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4\\ 5\\ 6\\ 7\\ 8 & \\text{(empty)} \\\\ \n\\text{2nd:} & 1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 8\\ & 4\\ 5\\ 6\\ 7 \\\\\n\\text{3rd:} & 1\\ 4\\ 5\\ 8\\ & 2\\ 3\\ 6\\ 7 \\\\\n\\text{4th:} & 1\\ 6\\ 7\\ 8\\ & 2\\ 3\\ 4\\ 5 \\\\\n\\text{5th:} & 2\\ 4\\ 6\\ 8\\ & 1\\ 3\\ 5\\ 7 \\\\\n\\text{6th:} & 2\\ 5\\ 7\\ 8\\ & 1\\ 3\\ 4\\ 6 \\\\\n\\text{7th:} & 3\\ 4\\ 7\\ 8\\ & 1\\ 2\\ 5\\ 6 \\\\\n\\text{8th:} & 3\\ 5\\ 6\\ 8\\ & 1\\ 2\\ 4\\ 7\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\n: Then the estimated value of the weight ''&theta;''<sub>1</sub> is\n\n:: <math>\\widehat{\\theta}_1 = \\frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + Y_4 - Y_5 - Y_6 - Y_7 - Y_8}{8}. </math>\n\n:Similar estimates can be found for the weights of the other items. For example\n\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\widehat{\\theta}_2 & = \\frac{Y_1 + Y_2 - Y_3 - Y_4 + Y_5 + Y_6 - Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\\\[5pt]\n\\widehat{\\theta}_3 & = \\frac{Y_1 + Y_2 - Y_3 - Y_4 - Y_5 - Y_6 + Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\\\[5pt]\n\\widehat{\\theta}_4 & = \\frac{Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_3 - Y_4 + Y_5 - Y_6 + Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\\\[5pt]\n\\widehat{\\theta}_5 & = \\frac{Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_3 - Y_4 - Y_5 + Y_6 - Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\\\[5pt]\n\\widehat{\\theta}_6 & = \\frac{Y_1 - Y_2 - Y_3 + Y_4 + Y_5 - Y_6 - Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\\\[5pt]\n\\widehat{\\theta}_7 & = \\frac{Y_1 - Y_2 - Y_3 + Y_4 - Y_5 + Y_6 + Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\\\[5pt]\n\\widehat{\\theta}_8 & = \\frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + Y_4 + Y_5 + Y_6 + Y_7 + Y_8} 8.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe question of design of experiments is: which experiment is better?\n\nThe variance of the estimate ''X''<sub>1</sub> of \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is \u03c3<sup>2</sup> if we use the first experiment.  But if we use the second experiment, the variance of the estimate given above is \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/8.  Thus the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item, and estimates all items simultaneously, with the same precision. What the second experiment achieves with eight would require 64 weighings if the items are weighed separately. However, note that the estimates for the items obtained in the second experiment have errors that correlate with each other.\n\nMany problems of the design of experiments involve [[combinatorial design]]s, as in this example and others.<ref name=\"yout_Howt\">{{Cite web\n| title = How to Use Design of Experiments to Create Robust Designs With High Yield\n| author = Jack Sifri\n| work = youtube.com\n| date = 8 December 2014\n| accessdate = 2015-02-11\n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfdZabCVwzc\n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\n==Avoiding false positives==\n[[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are an inherent hazard in many fields. A good way to prevent biases potentially leading to false positives in the data collection phase is to use a double-blind design. When a double-blind design is used, participants are randomly assigned to experimental groups but the researcher is unaware of what participants belong to which group. Therefore, the researcher can not affect the participants' response to the intervention.  \nExperimental designs with undisclosed degrees of freedom are a problem.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Simmons| first = Joseph|author2=Leif Nelson |author3=Uri Simonsohn | title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359\u20131366| publisher = Association for Psychological Science| location = Washington DC| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate = 29 January 2012| pmid = 22006061}}\n</ref>  This can lead to conscious or unconscious \"[[p-hacking]]\": trying multiple things until you get the desired result.  It typically involves the manipulation - perhaps unconsciously - of the process of [[statistical analysis]] and the degrees of freedom until they return a figure below the p<.05 level of statistical significance.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.kplu.org/post/science-trust-and-psychology-crisis\n | title=Science, Trust And Psychology In Crisis | work=[[KNKX|KPLU]]\n | date=2014-06-02\n | accessdate=2014-06-12 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | url=https://psmag.com/environment/statistically-significant-studies-arent-necessarily-significant-82832\n | title=Why Statistically Significant Studies Can Be Insignificant\n | work=Pacific Standard\n | date=2014-06-04\n | accessdate=2014-06-12 }}\n</ref>  So the design of the experiment should include a clear statement proposing the analyses to be undertaken. P-hacking can be prevented by preregistering researches, in which researchers have to send their data analysis plan to the journal they wish to publish their paper in before they even start their data collection, so no data manipulation is possible (https://osf.io). Another way to prevent this is taking the double-blind design to the data-analysis phase, where the data are sent to a data-analyst unrelated to the research who scrambles up the data so there is no way to know which participants belong to before they are potentially taken away as outliers.\n\nClear and complete documentation of the experimental methodology is also important in order to support replication of results.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/jun/10/physics-envy-do-hard-sciences-hold-the-solution-to-the-replication-crisis-in-psychology\n | title=Physics envy: Do \u2018hard\u2019 sciences hold the solution to the replication crisis in psychology?\n | work=theguardian.com\n | author=Chris Chambers\n | date=2014-06-10\n | accessdate=2014-06-12 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Discussion topics when setting up an experimental design==\nAn experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment.<ref>Ader, Mellenberg & Hand (2008) \"Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion\"</ref> An experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Some of the following topics  have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section:\n\n# How many factors does the design have, and are the levels of these factors fixed or random?\n# Are control conditions needed, and what should they be?\n# Manipulation checks; did the manipulation really work?\n# What are the background variables?\n# What is the sample size. How many units must be collected for the experiment to be generalisable and have enough [[Statistical power|power]]?\n# What is the relevance of interactions between factors?\n# What is the influence of delayed effects of substantive factors on outcomes?\n# How do response shifts affect self-report measures?\n# How feasible is repeated administration of the same measurement instruments to the same units at different occasions, with a post-test and follow-up tests?\n# What about using a proxy pretest?\n# Are there lurking variables?\n# Should the client/patient, researcher or even the analyst of the data be blind to conditions?\n# What is the feasibility of subsequent application of different conditions to the same units?\n# How many of each control and noise factors should be taken into account?\n\nThe independent variable of a study often has many levels or different groups. In a true experiment, researchers can have an experimental group, which is where their intervention testing the hypothesis is implemented, and a control group, which has all the same element as the experimental group, without the interventional element. Thus, when everything else except for one intervention is held constant, researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change. In some instances, having a control group is not ethical. This is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups. In some cases, independent variables cannot be manipulated, for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease, or testing the difference between genders (obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to). In these cases, a quasi-experimental design may be used.\n\n==Causal attributions==\nIn the pure experimental design, the independent (predictor) variable is manipulated by the researcher - that is - every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population, and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable. Only when this is done is it possible to certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the outcome variables are caused by the different conditions. Therefore, researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible. However, the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation. In those cases, researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn't allow for it. For example, in observational designs, participants are not assigned randomly to conditions, and so if there are differences found in outcome variables between conditions, it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes, that is - a third variable. The same goes for studies with correlational design. (Ad\u00e9r & Mellenbergh, 2008).\n\n==Statistical control==\nIt is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments.  When this is not possible, proper blocking, replication, and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments.<ref>Bisgaard, S (2008) \"Must a Process be in Statistical Control before Conducting Designed Experiments?\", ''Quality Engineering'', ASQ, 20 (2), pp 143 - 176</ref>\nTo control for nuisance variables, researchers institute '''control checks''' as additional measures.  Investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences (e.g., source credibility perception) do not skew the findings of the study.  A [[manipulation checks|manipulation check]] is one example of a control check.  Manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned.\n\nOne of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of [[spurious relationship|spurious]], intervening, and [[antecedent variable]]s. In the most basic model, cause (X) leads to effect (Y). But there could be a third variable (Z) that influences (Y), and X might not be the true cause at all. Z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for. The same is true for [[intervening variable]]s (a variable in between the supposed cause (X) and the effect (Y)), and anteceding variables (a variable prior to the supposed cause (X) that is the true cause). When a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for, the relation is said to be a [[zero order (statistics)|zero order]] relationship. In most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes (X1, X2, X3). In most designs, only one of these causes is manipulated at a time.\n\n==Experimental designs after Fisher==\nSome efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by [[Raj Chandra Bose]] and K. Kishen in 1940 at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], but remained little known until the [[Plackett\u2013Burman design]]s were published in ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1946. About the same time, [[C. R. Rao]] introduced the concepts of [[orthogonal array]]s as experimental designs. This concept played a central role in the development of [[Taguchi methods]] by [[Genichi Taguchi]], which took place during his visit to Indian Statistical Institute in early 1950s. His methods were successfully applied and adopted by Japanese and Indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by US industry albeit with some reservations.\n\nIn 1950, [[Gertrude Mary Cox]] and [[William Gemmell Cochran]] published the book ''Experimental Designs,'' which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.\n\nDevelopments of the theory of [[linear model]]s have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers. Today, the theory rests on advanced topics in [[linear algebra]], [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design|combinatorics]].\n\nAs with other branches of statistics, experimental design is pursued using both [[frequentist statistics|frequentist]] and [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian]] approaches: In evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs, [[frequentist statistics]] studies the [[sampling distribution]] while [[Bayesian statistics]] updates a [[Bayesian probability|probability distribution]] on the parameter space.\n\nSome important contributors to the field of experimental designs are [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.

It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect [[observation]] or [[experience]]. [[Empiricism]] values such research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed [[quantitative research|quantitatively]] or [[qualitative research|qualitatively.]] Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called [[data]]). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.\n\nIn some fields, quantitative research may begin with a research question (e.g., \"Does listening to vocal music during the learning of a word list have an effect on later memory for these words?\") which is tested through experimentation. Usually, a researcher has a certain [[theory]] regarding the topic under investigation. Based on this theory, statements or [[hypotheses]] will be proposed (e.g., \"Listening to vocal voice has a negative effect on learning a word list.\"). From these hypotheses, predictions about specific events are derived (e.g., \"People who study a word list while listening to vocal music will remember fewer words on a later memory test than people who study a word list in silence.\"). These predictions can then be tested with a suitable [[experiment]]. Depending on the outcomes of the experiment, the theory on which the hypotheses and predictions were based will be supported or not,<ref>Goodwin, C. J. (2005). ''Research in Psychology: Methods and Design.'' USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref> or may need to be modified and then subjected to further testing.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term [[empirical]] was originally used to refer to certain [[ancient Greek]] practitioners of medicine who rejected adherence to the [[dogma]]tic doctrines of the day, preferring instead to rely on the observation of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] as perceived in experience. Later [[empiricism]] referred to a theory of [[knowledge]] in philosophy which adheres to the principle that knowledge arises from experience and evidence gathered specifically using the senses. In scientific use, the term empirical refers to the gathering of data using only evidence that is observable by the senses or in some cases using calibrated scientific instruments. What early philosophers described as empiricist and empirical research have in common is the dependence on observable data to formulate and test theories and come to conclusions.\n\n==Usage==\nThe researcher attempts to describe accurately the interaction between the instrument (or the [[Sense|human senses]]) and the entity being observed. If instrumentation is involved, the researcher is expected to [[calibrate]] his/her instrument by applying it to known standard objects and documenting the results before applying it to unknown objects. In other words, it describes the research that has not taken place before and their results.\n\nIn practice, the accumulation of evidence for or against any particular theory involves planned [[research design]]s for the collection of [[Empirical evidence|empirical data]], and academic rigor plays a large part of judging the merits of [[research design]]. Several typologies for such designs have been suggested, one of the most popular of which comes from Campbell and Stanley.<ref>Campbell, D. & Stanley, J. (1963). ''Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> They are responsible for popularizing the widely cited distinction among [[Pre-experimental Science|pre-experimental]], [[experimental design|experimental]], and [[quasi-experimental design|quasi-experimental]] designs and are staunch advocates of the central role of randomized experiments in [[educational research]].\n\n=== Scientific research ===\nAccurate analysis of data using standardized statistical methods in [[Scientific method|scientific]] studies is critical to determining the validity of empirical research. [[statistics|Statistical]] formulas such as regression, [[uncertainty coefficient]], t-test, [[chi square]], and various types of [[Analysis of variance|ANOVA]] (analyses of variance) are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions. If empirical data reach significance under the appropriate statistical formula, the research [[hypothesis]] is supported. If not, the null hypothesis is supported (or, more accurately, not rejected), meaning no effect of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]](s) was observed on the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]](s).\n\nThe outcome of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never ''proof''. It can only ''support'' a hypothesis, ''reject'' it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities.\n\nAmong scientific researchers, empirical ''evidence'' (as distinct from empirical ''research'') refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well [[Calibration|calibrated]] [[thermometer]], is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.\n\nThe varying perception of empiricism and rationalism shows concern with the limit to which there is dependency on experience of sense as an effort of gaining knowledge. According to rationalism, there are a number of different ways in which sense experience is gained independently for the knowledge and concepts. According to empiricism, sense experience is considered as the main source of every piece of knowledge and the concepts. In reference with a specific piece of knowledge, this paper will focus on differentiating between rationalism and empiricism or rational views and empirical views. \nIn general, rationalists are known for the development of their own views following two different way. First, the key argument can be placed that there are cases in which the content of knowledge or concepts end up outstripping the information. This outstripped information is provided by the sense experience (Hj\u00f8rland, 2010, 2). Second, there is construction of accounts as to how reasoning helps in the provision of addition knowledge about a specific or broader scope. Empiricists are known to be presenting complementary senses related to thought. First there is development of accounts of how there is provision of information by experience that is cited by rationalists. This is insofar for having it in the initial place. At times, empiricists tend to be opting skepticism as an option of rationalism. If experience is not helpful in the provision of knowledge or concept cited by rationalists, then they do not exist (Pearce, 2010, 35). Second, empiricists hold the tendency of attacking the accounts of rationalists while considering reasoning to be an important source of knowledge or concepts. The overall disagreement between empiricists and rationalists show primary concerns in how there is gaining of knowledge with respect to the sources of knowledge and concept. In some of the cases, disagreement at the point of gaining knowledge results in the provision of conflicting responses to other aspects as well. There might be a disagreement in the overall feature of warrant, while limiting the knowledge and thought. Empiricists are known for sharing the view that there is no existence of innate knowledge and rather that is derivation of knowledge out of experience. These experiences are either reasoned using the mind or sensed through the five senses human possess (Bernard, 2011, 5). On the other hand, rationalists are known to be sharing the view that there is existence of innate knowledge and this is different for the objects of innate knowledge being chosen. In order to follow rationalism, there must be adoption of one of the three claims related to the theory that are Deduction or Intuition, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept. The more there is removal of concept from mental operations and experience, there can be performance over experience with increased plausibility in being innate. Further ahead, empiricism in context with a specific subject provides a rejection of corresponding version related to innate knowledge and deduction or intuition (Weiskopf, 2008, 16). Insofar as there is acknowledgement of concepts and knowledge within the area of subject, the knowledge has major dependence on experience through human senses.\n\n==Empirical cycle==\n[[Image:Empirical Cycle.svg|thumb|250px|Empirical cycle according to A.D. de Groot]]\n[[Adriaan de Groot|A.D. de Groot]]'s empirical cycle:<ref name=\"Heitink-1999\">Heitink, G.

In 1654, the [[Slide Rule]] technique was developed by [https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule#ref81001 Robert Bissaker] for advanced data calculations. In 1833, a British mathematician named [[Charles Babbage]] designed the idea of an automatic computer which inspired developers at [[Harvard University]] and [[IBM]] to design the first mechanical automatic-sequence-controlled calculator called [[harvard mark I|MARK I]]. The integration of computers and calculators into the industry brought about a more efficient means of analyzing data and the beginning of engineering statistics.<ref>{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|title=Slide Rule|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule#ref81001|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Prentice Hall\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Douglas|last2=Runger|first2=George|last3=Hubele|first3=Norma|title=Engineering Statistics|isbn=0470631473|edition=5}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |authors=Atkinson, A.

Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and the [[macabre]]. He is widely regarded as a central figure of [[Romanticism]] in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the [[detective fiction]] genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of [[science fiction]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stableford|2003|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.<ref name = Meyers138/>\n\nPoe was born in [[Boston]], the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They never formally adopted him, but Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Poe repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for Poe. He attended the [[University of Virginia]] but left after a year due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with the anonymous collection ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'' (1827), credited only to \"a Bostonian\". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at [[West Point]], declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan.\n\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]]. In Richmond in 1836, he married [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]], his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"[[The Raven]]\" to instant success. His wife died of [[tuberculosis]] two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal ''The Penn'' (later renamed ''[[The Stylus]]''), though he died before it could be produced. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, \"brain congestion\", [[cholera]], drugs, heart disease, [[rabies]], suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.<ref name=\"Meyers256\"/>\n\nPoe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields such as [[cosmology]] and [[cryptography]]. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The [[Mystery Writers of America]] present an annual award known as the [[Edgar Award]] for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Edgar Allan Poe Birthplace Boston.jpg|thumb|This plaque in [[Boston]] marks the ''approximate'' location<ref name=\"RavenRet\"/> where Edgar Poe was born.]]\n\nHe was born Edgar Poe in [[Boston]] on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe]] and actor [[David Poe Jr.]] He had an elder brother [[William Henry Leonard Poe]], and a younger sister Rosalie Poe.<ref name=Allen>{{harvnb|Allen|1927|p=}}</ref> Their grandfather David Poe Sr. had emigrated from [[County Cavan]], Ireland, to America around the year 1750.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=13}}</ref> Edgar may have been named after a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', a play that the couple were performing in 1809.<ref>{{harvnb|Nelson|1981|p=65}}</ref> His father abandoned their family in 1810,<ref>{{harvnb|Canada|1997|p=}}</ref> and his mother died a year later from consumption ([[pulmonary tuberculosis]]). Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in [[Richmond, Virginia]] who dealt in a variety of goods, including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and [[slavery|slaves]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=8}}</ref> The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\",<ref name=Meyers9>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=9}}</ref> though they never formally adopted him.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=61}}</ref>\n\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.<ref name=Meyers9/> The family sailed to Britain in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Scotland (where John Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at [[Stoke Newington]], then a suburb {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} north of London.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond, Virginia in 1820.

It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=32\u201334}}</ref> Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton.

Perry\". He claimed that he was {{nowrap|22 years old}} even though he was 18.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=13}}</ref> He first served at [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] in [[Boston Harbor]] for five&nbsp;dollars a month.<ref name=Meyers32/> That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', attributed with the byline \"by a Bostonian\". Only 50&nbsp;copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=33\u201334}}</ref> Poe's regiment was posted to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and traveled by ship on the brig ''Waltham'' on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for [[artillery]], and had his monthly pay doubled.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=35}}</ref> He served for two&nbsp;years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a noncommissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be [[military discharge|discharged]] if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=43\u201347}}</ref>\n\nPoe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=38}}</ref> Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Eliza Clemm]] (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Meanwhile, Poe published his second book ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems'' in Baltimore in 1829.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=5}}</ref>\n\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.<ref>{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=32}}</ref> In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=14}}</ref> The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=54\u201355}}</ref> Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting [[court-martial]]ed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=49\u201351}}</ref>\n\nHe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled ''Poems.'' The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75&nbsp;cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition,\" and including a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\".

He placed a few stories with a [[Philadelphia]] publication and began work on his only drama ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]''. The ''[[Baltimore Saturday Visiter]]'' awarded Poe a prize in October 1833 for his short story \"[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=162}}</ref> The story brought him to the attention of [[John P. Kennedy]], a Baltimorean of considerable means. He helped Poe place some of his stories, and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835,<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=225}}</ref> but was discharged within a few weeks for having been caught drunk by his boss.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=73}}</ref> Returning to Baltimore, Poe obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.<ref name=\"Silverman 1991 124\">{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=124}}</ref> He was 26 and she was 13.\n\nHe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the ''Messenger'' until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.<ref name=Allen/> He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia Clemm held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.<ref name=\"Silverman 1991 124\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=85}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' was published and widely reviewed in 1838.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=137}}</ref> In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of ''[[Burton's Gentleman's Magazine]]''. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the ''Southern Literary Messenger''. Also in 1839, the collection ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' was published in two&nbsp;volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=113}}</ref> Poe left ''Burton's'' after about a year and found a position as assistant at ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|pp=39, 99}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called ''[[The Stylus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=119}}</ref> Originally, Poe intended to call the journal ''The Penn'', as it would have been based in Philadelphia.

In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to  [[magnetism]].  Later on, many experimental results and the development of [[Maxwell's equations]] indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: [[electromagnetism]].  Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including [[lightning]], [[static electricity]], [[electric heating]], [[electric discharge]]s and many others.\n\nThe presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an [[electric field]]. The movement of electric charges is an [[electric current]] and produces a [[magnetic field]].\n\nWhen a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by [[Coulomb's law]]. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing [[Work (physics)|work]] on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of [[electric potential]] at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in [[volt]]s.\n\nElectricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\n* '''[[electric power]]''' where electric current is used to energise equipment;\n* '''[[electronics]]''' which deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[Passivity (engineering)|active electrical components]] such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\n\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include [[motive power|transport]], [[HVAC|heating]], [[electric light|lighting]], [[Telecommunication|communications]], and [[computation]].

Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, [[electrical conductor]]s, but will not flow through an [[electrical insulator]].<ref>Shock and Awe: The Story of Electricity \u2013 Jim Al-Khalili BBC Horizon</ref>\n\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called [[conventional current]]. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an [[electric circuit]], one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the ''opposite'' direction to that of the electrons.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| first = Robert | last = Ward\n| title = Introduction to Electrical Engineering\n| publisher = Prentice-Hall\n| page = 18\n| year = 1960}}\n</ref> However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of [[charged particle]]s in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\n\n[[File:Lichtbogen 3000 Volt.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two metal wires form an inverted V shape. A blindingly bright orange-white electric arc flows between their tips.|An [[electric arc]] provides an energetic demonstration of electric current]]\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed [[electrical conduction]], and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as metal, and [[electrolysis]], where [[ion]]s (charged [[atom]]s) flow through liquids, or through [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average [[drift velocity]] only fractions of a millimetre per second,<ref name=Duffin/>{{rp|17}} the [[electric field]] that drives them itself propagates at close to the [[speed of light]], enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| first = L. | last = Solymar\n| title = Lectures on electromagnetic theory\n| publisher = Oxford University Press\n| page = 140\n| year = 1984\n| isbn = 0-19-856169-5}}\n</ref>\n\nCurrent causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by [[William Nicholson (chemist)|Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle|Carlisle]] in 1800, a process now known as [[electrolysis]]. Their work was greatly expanded upon by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1833. Current through a [[electrical resistance|resistance]] causes localised heating, an effect [[James Prescott Joule]] studied mathematically in 1840.<ref name=Duffin/>{{rp|23\u201324}} One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass.<ref name=berkson>\n{{Citation\n| first = William | last = Berkson\n| title = Fields of Force: The Development of a World View from Faraday to Einstein\n| publisher = Routledge\n| page = 370\n| year = 1974\n| isbn = 0-7100-7626-6}} Accounts differ as to whether this was before, during, or after a lecture.</ref> He had discovered [[electromagnetism]], a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions  generated by [[electric arc]]ing is high enough to produce [[electromagnetic interference]], which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.<ref>{{cite web | title = Lab Note #105 ''EMI Reduction \u2013 Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/| accessdate = March 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either [[direct current]] (DC) or [[alternating current]] (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and required by most [[Electronics|electronic]] devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.<ref name=bird>\n{{citation\n| first = John | last = Bird\n| title = Electrical and Electronic Principles and Technology, 3rd edition\n| publisher = Newnes\n| year = 2007\n| isbn = 9781417505432}}\n</ref>{{rp|11}} If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a [[sine wave]].<ref name=bird/>{{rp|206\u201307}} Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under [[steady state]] direct current, such as [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]].<ref name=bird/>{{rp|223\u201325}} These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to [[transient response|transients]], such as when first energised.\n\n===Electric field===\n{{Main|Electric field}}\n{{See also|Electrostatics}}\n\nThe concept of the electric [[Field (physics)|field]] was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]]. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two [[mass]]es, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance.<ref name=Umashankar/> However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.<ref name=hawking/>\n\n[[File:VFPt image charge plane horizontal.svg|thumb|Field lines emanating from a positive charge above a plane conductor]]\n\nAn electric field generally varies in space,<ref>Almost all electric fields vary in space. An exception is the electric field surrounding a planar conductor of infinite extent, the field of which is uniform.</ref> and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|469\u201370}} The conceptual charge, termed a '[[test charge]]', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of [[magnetic field]]s. As the electric field is defined in terms of [[force]], and force is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]. Specifically, it is a [[vector field]].<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|469\u201370}}\n\nThe study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called [[electrostatics]]. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday,<ref name=\"elec_princ_p73\">\n{{citation\n| last = Morely & Hughes\n| title = Principles of Electricity, Fifth edition\n| page = 73\n| isbn = 0-582-42629-4}}</ref> whose term '[[Line of force|lines of force]]' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines.<ref name=\"elec_princ_p73\"/> Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|479}}\n\nA hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.<ref name=Duffin/>{{rp|88}} This is the operating principal of the [[Faraday cage]], a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.\n\nThe principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of [[high voltage|high-voltage]] equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, [[electrical breakdown]] occurs and an [[electric arc]] causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30&nbsp;kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1&nbsp;kV per centimetre.<ref name=hv_eng>\n{{Citation\n| first = M.S.| last = Naidu\n| first2 = V.| last2 = Kamataru\n| title = High Voltage Engineering\n| publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill\n| page = 2\n| year = 1982\n| isbn = 0-07-451786-4}}\n</ref> The most visible natural occurrence of this is [[lightning]], caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand.

The +&nbsp;sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals.]]\n\nThe concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires [[Mechanical work|work]]. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an [[infinity|infinite distance]] slowly to that point. It is usually measured in [[volt]]s, and one volt is the potential for which one [[joule]] of work must be expended to bring a charge of one [[coulomb]] from infinity.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|494\u201398}} This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of [[electric potential difference]], and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is ''[[Conservative force|conservative]]'', which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|494\u201398}} The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term [[voltage]] sees greater everyday usage.\n\nFor practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the [[Earth]] itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] or [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged\u2014and unchargeable.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| first = Raymond A. | last = Serway\n| title = Serway's College Physics\n| publisher = Thomson Brooks\n| page = 500\n| year = 2006\n| isbn = 0-534-99724-4}}\n</ref>\n\nElectric potential is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]], that is, it has only magnitude and not direction.

[[Electronic circuit]]s contain [[active component]]s, usually [[semiconductor]]s, and typically exhibit [[non-linear]] behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed [[passivity (engineering)|passive]] and [[linear]]: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.<ref name=Alexander>{{Citation  | last = Alexander  | first = Charles  | last2 = Sadiku  | first2 = Matthew  | title = Fundamentals of Electric Circuits  | publisher = McGraw-Hill  | year = 2006  | edition = 3, revised  |isbn = 9780073301150}}</ref>{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe [[resistor]] is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it [[Electrical resistance|resists]] the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance is a consequence of the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. [[Ohm's law]] is a basic law of [[circuit theory]], stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The [[ohm]], the unit of resistance, was named in honour of [[Georg Ohm]], and is symbolised by the Greek letter \u03a9. 1&nbsp;\u03a9 is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.<ref name=Alexander/>{{rp|30\u201335}}\n\nThe [[capacitor]] is a development of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin [[Insulator (electricity)|insulating]] [[dielectric]] layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the [[capacitance]]. The unit of capacitance is the [[farad]], named after [[Michael Faraday]], and given the symbol ''F'': one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a [[steady state]] current, but instead blocks it.<ref name=Alexander/>{{rp|216\u201320}}\n\nThe [[inductor]] is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, [[electromagnetic induction|inducing]] a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the [[Time derivative|time rate of change]] of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the [[inductance]]. The unit of inductance is the [[Henry (unit)|henry]], named after [[Joseph Henry]], a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.<ref name=Alexander/>{{rp|226\u201329}}\n\n===Electric power===\n{{main|electric power}}\nElectric power is the rate at which [[electric energy]] is transferred by an [[electric circuit]]. The [[SI]] unit of [[power (physics)|power]] is the [[watt (unit)|watt]], one [[joule]] per [[second]].\n\nElectric power, like [[power (physics)|mechanical power]], is the rate of doing [[work (electrical)|work]], measured in [[watt]]s, and represented by the letter ''P''. The term ''wattage'' is used colloquially to mean \"electric power in watts.\"  The electric power in [[watt]]s produced by an electric current ''I'' consisting of a charge of ''Q'' coulombs every ''t'' seconds passing through an [[electric potential]] ([[voltage]]) difference of ''V'' is\n:<math>P = \\text{work done per unit time} = \\frac {QV}{t} = IV \\,</math>\nwhere\n:''Q'' is electric charge in [[coulomb]]s\n:''t'' is time in seconds\n:''I'' is electric current in [[ampere]]s\n:''V'' is electric potential or voltage in [[volt]]s\n\n[[Electricity generation]] is often done with [[electric generator]]s, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as [[electric batteries]] or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the [[electric power industry]]. Electricity is usually sold by the [[kilowatt hour]] (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours.  Electric utilities measure power using [[electricity meter]]s, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer.

His father Meton seems to have been instrumental in overthrowing the tyrant of Akragas, presumably [[Thrasydaeus]] in 470 BC. Empedocles continued this tradition by helping to overthrow the succeeding [[oligarchic]] government.

In his poem ''Purifications'' he claimed miraculous powers, including the destruction of evil, the curing of old age, and the controlling of wind and rain.\n\nEmpedocles was acquainted or connected by friendship with the physicians [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]]<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 60, 61, 65, 69</ref> (his [[eromenos]]<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 60: \"Pausanias, according to [[Aristippus]] and [[Satyrus the Peripatetic|Satyrus]], was his eromenos\"</ref>) and [[Acron]];<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'', xxix.1.4\u20135; cf.

Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]]<ref>Hermippus and Theophrastus, ap. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 55, 56</ref>\u2014allusions to the latter can be found in the fragments\u2014but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. [[Aristotle]] called him the father of [[rhetoric]], and, although he acknowledged only the [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of [[Homer]], he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1, ap. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 57.</ref> [[Lucretius]] speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model.<ref>See especially Lucretius, i. 716, etc. Refer to {{harvp|Sedley|1998}}.</ref> The two poems together comprised 5000 lines.<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 77</ref> About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the ''Purifications'' merely formed the beginning of ''On Nature''.<ref>Simon Tr\u00e9panier, (2004), ''Empedocles: An Interpretation'', Routledge.</ref>\n\n===''Purifications''===\nWe possess only about 100 lines that have been ascribed to his ''Purifications''. It seems to have given a mythical account of the world which may, nevertheless, have been part of Empedocles' philosophical system. The first lines of the poem are preserved by [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]]:\n<poem>\nFriends who inhabit the mighty town by tawny Acragas\nwhich crowns the citadel, caring for good deeds,\ngreetings; I, an immortal God, no longer mortal,\nwander among you, honoured by all,\nadorned with holy diadems and blooming garlands.\nTo whatever illustrious towns I go,\nI am praised by men and women, and accompanied\nby thousands, who thirst for deliverance,\nsome ask for prophecies, and some entreat,\nfor remedies against all kinds of disease.<ref>[[Diels\u2013Kranz numbering system|DK]] frag. B112 (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 61)</ref>\n</poem>\nIt was probably this work which contained a story about [[soul]]s,<ref>Frag. B115 (Plutarch, ''On Exile'', 607 C\u2013E; Hippolytus, vii. 29)</ref> where we are told that there were once spirits who lived in a state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, [[reincarnate]]d from body to body. Humans, animals, and even plants are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem may allow us to become like [[Pantheon (gods)|gods]] again.\n\n===''On Nature''===\nThere are about 450 lines of his poem ''On Nature'' extant, including 70 lines which have been reconstructed from some papyrus scraps known as the ''Strasbourg Papyrus''. The poem originally consisted of 2000 lines of [[hexameter]] verse,<ref>Suda, ''Empedocles''</ref> and was addressed to [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]].<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, viii. 60</ref> It was this poem which outlined his philosophical system. In it, Empedocles explains not only the nature and history of the universe, including his theory of the four [[classical element]]s, but he describes theories on causation, perception, and thought, as well as explanations of terrestrial phenomena and biological processes.\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[File:Empedocles-2-sized.jpg|right|thumb|Empedocles as portrayed in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]\nAlthough acquainted with the theories of the [[Eleatics]] and the [[Pythagoreans]], Empedocles did not belong to any one definite school. An [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] in his thinking, he combined much that had been suggested by [[Parmenides]], [[Pythagoras]] and the [[Ionian school (philosophy)|Ionian school]]s. He was a firm believer in [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mysteries]], as well as a scientific thinker and a precursor of [[physics]]. Aristotle mentions Empedocles among the Ionic philosophers, and he places him in very close relation to the [[atomism|atomist]] philosophers and to [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', i. 3, 4, 7, ''Phys.'' i. 4, ''de General, et Corr.'' i. 8, ''de Caelo'', iii. 7.</ref>\n\nAccording to House (1956)<ref>{{cite book |last=House |first=Humphry |url=https://archive.org/details/aristotlespoetic032945mbp |page=32 |title=Aristotles Poetics |year=1956}}</ref>\n:Another of the fragments of the dialogue ''On the Poets'' ([[Aristotle]]) treats more fully what is said in Poetics ch. i about ''Empedocles'', for though clearly implying that he was not a poet, Aristotle there says he is [[Homeric]], and an artist in language, skilled in metaphor and in the other devices of poetry.\n\nEmpedocles, like the Ionian philosophers and the atomists, continued the tradition of tragic thought which tried to find the basis of the relationship of the one and many. Each of the various philosophers, following Parmenides, derived from the Eleatics, the conviction that an existence could not pass into non-existence, and vice versa. Yet, each one had his peculiar way of describing this relation of Divine and mortal thought and thus of the relation of the One and the Many. In order to account for change in the world, in accordance with the ontological requirements of the Eleatics, they viewed changes as the result of mixture and separation of unalterable fundamental realities. Empedocles held that the four elements (Water, Air, Earth, and Fire) were those unchangeable fundamental realities, which were themselves transfigured into successive worlds by the powers of Love and Strife ([[Heraclitus]] had explicated the Logos or the \"unity of opposites\").<ref>James Luchte, Early Greek Thought: Before the Dawn, Bloomsbury, 2011.</ref>\n\n===The four elements===\nEmpedocles established four ultimate [[classical elements|elements]] which make all the structures in the world\u2014[[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]<ref>Frag. B17 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 157\u2013159)</ref>\u2014 in other words, the several states of matter are represented, being energies, gasses, liquids, and solids. Empedocles called these four elements \"roots\", which he also identified with the mythical names of [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Persephone|Nestis]], and [[Aidoneus]]<ref>Frag. B6 (Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', x, 315)</ref> (e.g., \"Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with tears.\"<ref>[[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]], in ''Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).</ref>) Empedocles never used the term \"element\" ({{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''stoicheion''), which seems to have been first used by [[Plato]].<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', 48b\u2013c</ref> According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element. This theory of the four elements became the standard [[dogma]] for the next two thousand years.\n\n===Love and Strife===\n{{distinguish|text=the Greek deities [[Aphrodite|of love]] and [[Eris (mythology)|strife]]}}\n[[File:Empedocles cosmic cycle concept map.svg|300px|right|thumb|Empedocles cosmic cycle is based on the conflict between love and strife]]\nThe four elements, however, are simple, eternal, and unalterable, and as change is the consequence of their mixture and separation, it was also necessary to suppose the existence of moving powers that bring about mixture and separation. The four elements are both eternally brought into union and parted from one another by two divine powers, [[Love]] and [[Wikt:strife|Strife]]. Love ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}}) is responsible for the attraction of different forms of matter, and Strife ({{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}) is the cause of their separation.<ref>Frag. B35, B26 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31\u201334)</ref> If the four elements make up the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, which are plainly observable in human behavior, but also pervade the universe. The two forces wax and wane in their dominance, but neither force ever wholly escapes the imposition of the other.\n\n===The sphere of Empedocles===\nAs the best and original state, there was a time when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere.<ref>Frag. B35 (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31\u201334; ''On the Heavens'', 528\u2013530)</ref> Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of [[God]]. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.\n\n===Cosmogony===\nEmpedocles attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the [[physiology]] of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results\u2014heads without necks, arms without shoulders.<ref>Frag. B57 (Simplicius, ''On the Heavens'', 586)</ref> Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of [[intersexuality|double sex]].<ref>Frag. B61 (Aelian, ''On Animals'', xvi 29)</ref> But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts were found to be adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], although Empedocles was not trying to explain [[evolution]].<ref>Ted Everson (2007), ''The gene: a historical perspective'' page 5. Greenwood</ref>\n\n===Perception and knowledge===\nEmpedocles is credited with the first comprehensive theory of light and vision. He put forward the idea that we see objects because light streams out of our eyes and touches them. While flawed, this became the fundamental basis on which later Greek philosophers and mathematicians like [[Euclid]] would construct some of the most important theories of light, vision, and optics.<ref name = Ep1>''[[Let There be Light]]'' 7 August 2006 01:50 BBC Four</ref>\n\nKnowledge is explained by the principle that elements in the things outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves.<ref>Frag. B109 (Aristotle, ''On the Soul'', 404b11\u201315)</ref> Like is known by like. The whole body is full of [[Sweat pore|pores]] and hence [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] takes place over the whole frame. In the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies around us; thus  [[perception]] occurs.<ref name=\"frag100\">[http://www.mycrandall.ca/courses/grphil/EmpedoclesText.htm Frag. B100] (Aristotle, ''On Respiration'', 473b1\u2013474a6)</ref> In vision, certain particles go forth from the eye to meet similar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes vision.<ref>Frag. B84 (Aristotle, ''On the Senses and their Objects'', 437b23\u2013438a5)</ref> Perception is not merely a passive reflection of external objects.\n\nEmpedocles noted the limitation and narrowness of human perceptions. We see only a part but fancy that we have grasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection must look at the thing from every side. It is the business of a philosopher, while laying bare the fundamental difference of elements, to show the identity that exists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.<ref>Frag. B2 (Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', vii. 123\u2013125)</ref>\n\n===Respiration===\nIn a famous fragment,<ref name=\"frag100\"/> Empedocles attempted to explain the phenomena of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by means of an elaborate analogy with the [[Water thief|clepsydra]], an ancient device for conveying liquids from one vessel to another.<ref name=\"barnes313\">[[Jonathan Barnes]] (2002), ''The Presocratic Philosophers'', page 313. Routledge</ref> This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that [[Vacuum|void]] does not exist.<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'', 213a24\u20137</ref> There is however, no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras.<ref name=\"barnes313\"/> The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the [[Matter|corporeality]] of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void.<ref name=\"barnes313\"/> The clepsydra was a common utensil and everyone who used it must have known, in some sense, that the invisible air could resist liquid.<ref name=\"guthrie224\">[[W.

B127 (Aelian, ''On Animals'', xii. 7); Frag. B117 (Hippolytus, i. 3.2)</ref> For Empedocles, all living things were on the same spiritual plane; plants and animals are links in a chain where humans are a link too.

Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed he would come back as a god after being consumed by the fire.

Although a bit singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the Moon, surviving by feeding on dew.\n\nEmpedocles' death has inspired two major modern literary treatments. Empedocles' death is the subject of [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]'s play ''Tod des Empedokles'' (''[[The Death of Empedocles]]''), two versions of which were written between the years 1798 and 1800. A third version was made public in 1826. In [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem ''Empedocles on Etna'', a narrative of the philosopher's last hours before he jumps to his death in the crater first published in 1852, Empedocles predicts:\n<poem>\nTo the elements it came from\nEverything will return.\nOur bodies to earth,\nOur blood to water,\nHeat to fire,\nBreath to air.\n</poem>\n\nIn his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] humorously quotes an unnamed poet on the subject&nbsp;\u2013 \"Great Empedocles, that ardent soul, Leapt into Etna, and was roasted whole.\"<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', 1946, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&pg=PA60&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 60]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[J R]]'' by [[William Gaddis]], Karl Marx's famous dictum (\"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\") is misattributed to Empedocles.<ref>JR by William Gaddis, Dalkey Archive, 2012</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a massive underwater volcano off the coast of Sicily was named [[Empedocles (volcano)|Empedocles]].<ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5108360.stm ''Underwater volcano found by Italy''], 23 June 2006</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Scottish musician [[Momus (musician)|Momus]] wrote and sung the song \"The Death of Empedokles\" for his album ''[[Scobberlotchers]]''.<ref name=\"Freeman 2016\">{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Zachary|title=Albums|url=http://nowthenmagazine.com/manchester/issue-35/albums/|work=Now Then|date=September 2016|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of vegetarians]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Matthew|title=Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems|date=1852|publisher=B.

Their leaves are usually alternate or whorled, simple and without [[stipule]]s. Their flowers are [[Plant sexuality#Individual plant sexuality|hermaphrodite]] and show considerable variability. The [[petal]]s are often fused ([[sympetalous]]) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely urn-shaped. The [[corolla (flower)|corollas]] are usually [[radially symmetrical]] ([[actinomorphic]]) and urn-shaped, but many flowers of the genus ''Rhododendron'' are somewhat [[bilaterally symmetrical]] ([[zygomorphic]]).<ref name=Wats92/> Anthers open by pores. <ref>http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/phylo_eric.htm\n</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[Adanson]] used the term Vaccinia to describe a similar family, but [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|Jussieu]] first used the term Ericaceae. The name comes from the type genus ''[[Erica]]'', which appears to be derived from the Greek word ''ereike''. The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning 'heather'. The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants before [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] times, and simply been formalised when Linnaeus described ''Erica'' in 1753, and then again when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.<ref name=Juss89/>\n\nHistorically, the Ericaceae included both subfamilies and tribes. In 1971, Stevens, who outlined the history from 1876 and in some instances 1839, recognised six subfamilies (Rhododendroideae, [[Ericoideae]], Vaccinioideae, Pyroloideae, Monotropoideae, and Wittsteinioideae), and further subdivided four of the subfamilies into tribes, the Rhododendroideae having seven tribes (Bejarieae, Rhodoreae, Cladothamneae, Epigaeae, Phyllodoceae, and Diplarcheae).{{sfnp|Stevens|1971}} Within tribe Rhodoreae, five genera were described, ''[[Rhododendron]]'' L. (including ''Azalea'' L. pro parte), ''Therorhodion'' Small, ''[[Ledum]]'' L., ''Tsusiophyllum'' Max., ''[[Menziesia]]'' J. E. Smith, that were eventually transferred into ''Rhododendron'', along with Diplarche from the monogeneric tribe Diplarcheae.<ref name=Crav11/>\n\nIn 2002, systematic research resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a [[phylogenetic]] framework.<ref name=KronJudd02/> The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group. One possible classification of the resulting family includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4000 species:<ref name=APweb/>\n\n*[[Enkianthoideae]] <small>Kron, Judd & Anderberg</small> (one genus, 16 species)\n*[[Pyroloideae]] <small>Kosteltsky</small> (4 genera, 40 species)\n*[[Monotropoideae]] <small>Arnott</small> (10 genera, 15 species)\n*[[Arbutoideae]] <small>Niedenzu</small> (up to six genera, about 80 species)\n*[[Cassiopoideae]] <small>Kron & Judd</small> (one genus, 12 species)\n*[[Ericoideae]] <small>Link</small> (19 genera, 1790 species)\n*[[Harrimanelloideae]] <small>Kron & Judd</small> (one genus, two species)\n*[[Styphelioideae]] <small>Sweet</small> (35 genera, 545 species)\n*[[Vaccinioideae]] <small>Arnott</small> (50 genera, 1580 species)\n\n=== Genera ===\n:See the full list at [[List of Ericaceae genera]].\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\nThe Ericaceae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental [[Antarctica]], parts of the high [[Arctic]], central [[Greenland]], northern and central [[Australia]], and much of the lowland [[tropics]] and [[neotropics]].<ref name=APweb/>\n\nThe family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile conditions. Like other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal [[fungi]] to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile [[soil]]s, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients.<ref name=Kedd07/> This trait is not found in the [[Clethraceae]] and [[Cyrillaceae]], the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, and some Styphelioideae) form a distinctive accumulation of [[ericoid mycorrhiza|mycorrhizae]], in which fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients.<ref name=Cair03/> The [[Pyroloideae]] are [[mixotrophic]] and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.<ref name=Liu10/>\n\nIn many parts of the world, a \"[[heath]]\" or \"heathland\" is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-[[shrub]] community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in the Ericaceae. A common example is ''[[Erica tetralix]]''. This plant family is also typical of peat [[bog]]s and blanket bogs; examples include ''[[Rhododendron groenlandicum]]'' and ''[[Kalmia polifolia]]''. In eastern [[North America]], members of this family often grow in association with an [[oak]] canopy, in a habitat known as an [[oak-heath forest]].<ref name=ViGov/>\n\nIn heathland, plants in the family Ericaceae serve as hostplants to the butterfly, ''Plebejus argus''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=C. D.|date=1985-08-01|title=Specializations and polyphagy of Plebejus argus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) in North Wales|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1985.tb00729.x/abstract|journal=Ecological Entomology|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=325\u2013340|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1985.tb00729.x|issn=1365-2311}}</ref>''.''\n\nSome evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as ''Erica tetralix'' to [[grassland]]s.<ref name=Kedd10/> [[Nitrogen]] is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=APGIII2009>{{Cite journal |author=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=APweb>Stevens, P.F.

An '''electrical circuit''' is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current. [[Linear circuit|Linear]] electrical networks, a special type consisting only of sources (voltage or current), linear lumped elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors), and linear distributed elements (transmission lines), have the property that signals are [[Superposition principle|linearly superimposable]].  They are thus more easily analyzed, using powerful [[frequency domain]] methods such as [[Laplace transform]]s, to determine [[direct current|DC response]], [[alternating current|AC response]], and [[transient response]].\n\nA '''resistive circuit''' is a circuit containing only resistors and ideal current and voltage sources.  [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|Analysis]] of resistive circuits is less complicated than analysis of circuits containing capacitors and inductors.  If the sources are constant ([[Direct current|DC]]) sources, the result is a [[direct current circuit|DC circuit]]. The effective resistance and current distribution properties of arbitrary resistor networks can be modeled in terms of their graph measures and geometrical properties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ankush|last2=Vidhyadhiraja|first2=N.

Such networks are generally nonlinear and require more complex design and analysis tools.\n\n==Classification==\n\n===By passivity===\nAn active network is a network that contains an active source \u2013 either a [[voltage source]] or [[current source]].\n\nA [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] network is a network that does not contain an active source.\n\nAn active network contains one or more sources of [[electromotive force]]. It consists of active elements like a battery or a transistor. Active elements can inject power to the circuit, provide power gain, and control the current flow within the circuit.\n\nPassive networks do not contain any sources of electromotive force. They consist of passive elements like resistors and capacitors. These elements are not capable of the same functions as active elements.\n\n===By linearity===\nA network is linear if its signals obey the principle of [[Superposition theorem|superposition]]; otherwise it is non-linear.\n\n===By lumpiness===\nDiscrete passive components (resistors, capacitors and inductors) are called ''lumped elements'' because all of their, respectively, resistance, capacitance and inductance is assumed to be located (\"lumped\") at one place.  This design philosophy is called the [[lumped element model]] and networks so designed are called ''lumped element circuits''.  This is the conventional approach to circuit design.  At high enough frequencies the lumped assumption no longer holds because there is a significant fraction of a [[wavelength]] across the component dimensions.  A new design model is needed for such cases called the [[distributed element model]].  Networks designed to this model are called [[distributed element circuit]]s.\n\nA distributed element circuit that includes some lumped components is called a ''semi-lumped'' design.  An example of a semi-lumped circuit is the [[combline filter]].\n\n==Classification of sources==\nSources can be classified as independent sources and dependent sources.\n\n===Independent===\nAn ideal independent source maintains the same voltage or current regardless of the other elements present in the circuit. Its value is either constant (DC) or sinusoidal (AC). The strength of voltage or current is not changed by any variation in the connected network.\n\n===Dependent===\n[[Dependent source]]s depend upon a particular element of the circuit for delivering the power or voltage or current depending upon the type of source it is.\n\n==Electrical laws==\nA number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks. These include:\n*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's current law]]: The sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node.\n*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law|Kirchhoff's voltage law]]: The directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a loop must be zero.\n*[[Ohm's law]]: The voltage across a resistor is equal to the product of the resistance and the current flowing through it.\n*[[Norton's theorem]]: Any network of voltage or current sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor.\n*[[Th\u00e9venin's theorem]]: Any network of voltage or current sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor.\n*[[Superposition theorem]]: In a linear network with several independent sources, the response in a particular branch when all the sources are acting simultaneously is equal to the linear sum of individual responses calculated by taking one independent source at a time.\n\nOther more complex laws may be needed if the network contains nonlinear or [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] components. Non-linear self-regenerative [[Heterodyne|heterodyning]] systems can be approximated. Applying these laws results in a set of [[simultaneous equations]] that can be solved either algebraically or numerically.\n\n==Design methods==\n{{Network analysis navigation}}\n{{see also|Network analysis (electrical circuits)}}\n\nTo design any electrical circuit, either [[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[Digital circuit|digital]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] need to be able to predict the voltages and currents at all places within the circuit.  Simple [[linear circuit]]s can be analyzed by hand using [[Complex number|complex number theory]]. In more complex cases the circuit may be analyzed with specialized [[computer program]]s or estimation techniques such as the piecewise-linear model.\n\nCircuit simulation software, such as [[HSPICE]] (an analog circuit simulator),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee133/spice/HSpice.pdf|title=HSPICE|last=|first=|date=1999|website=HSpice|publisher=Stanford University, Electrical Engineering Department|access-date=}}</ref> and languages such as [[VHDL-AMS]] and [[verilog-AMS]] allow engineers to design circuits without the time, cost and risk of error involved in building circuit prototypes.\n\n==Network simulation software==\nMore complex circuits can be analyzed numerically with software such as [[SPICE]] or [[GNU Circuit Analysis Package|GNUCAP]], or symbolically using software such as [[SapWin]].\n\n===Linearization around operating point===\nWhen faced with a new circuit, the software first tries to find a [[Steady state|steady state solution]], that is, one where all nodes conform to Kirchhoff's current law ''and'' the voltages across and through each element of the circuit conform to the voltage/current equations governing that element.\n\nOnce the steady state solution is found, the '''operating points''' of each element in the circuit are known.  For a small signal analysis, every non-linear element can be linearized around its operation point to obtain the small-signal estimate of the voltages and currents.  This is an application of Ohm's Law.  The resulting linear circuit matrix can be solved with [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\n===Piecewise-linear approximation===\nSoftware such as the [[PLECS]] interface to [[Simulink]] uses [[Piecewise linear function|piecewise-linear]] approximation of the equations governing the elements of a circuit.  The circuit is treated as a completely linear network of [[Diode modelling#Mathematically idealized diode|ideal diode]]s.  Every time a diode switches from on to off or vice versa, the configuration of the linear network changes.  Adding more detail to the approximation of equations increases the accuracy of the simulation, but also increases its running time.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Circuit diagrams|electric circuits}}\n{{Wiktionary|electrical circuit}}\n\n* [[Digital circuit]]\n* [[Ground (electricity)]]\n* [[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]\n* [[External electric load|Load]]\n* [[Memristor]]\n* [[Open-circuit voltage]]\n* [[Short circuit]]\n\n* [[Voltage drop]]\n\n===Representation===\n* [[Circuit diagram]]\n* [[Schematic]]\n* [[Netlist]]\n\n===Design and analysis methodologies===\n* [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)]]\n* [[Mathematical methods in electronics]]\n* [[Superposition theorem]]\n* [[Topology (electronics)]]\n* [[Mesh analysis]]\n* [[Prototype filter]]\n\n===Measurement===\n* [[Network analyzer (electrical)]]\n* [[Network analyzer (AC power)]]\n* [[Continuity test]]\n\n===Analogies===\n* [[Hydraulic analogy]]\n* [[Mechanical-electrical analogies]]\n* [[Impedance analogy]]\n* [[Mobility analogy]]\n\n===Specific topologies===\n* [[Bridge circuit]]\n* [[LC circuit]]\n* [[RC circuit]]\n* [[RL circuit]]\n* [[RLC circuit]]\n* [[Potential divider]]\n* [[Series and parallel circuits]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Electronics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrical Network}}\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n\n[[de:Netzwerk (Elektrotechnik)]]", "sha1": "m0o59a7zr60mdvkzhhnlfmcpcfocm8q"}}, {"title": "Euler (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "9561", "revision": {"id": "820208198", "parentid": "818921780", "timestamp": "2018-01-13T17:36:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "Narky Blert", "id": "22041646"}, "comment": "Link to DAB page repaired.

Some [[axiomatic set theories]] ensure that the empty set exists by including an [[axiom of empty set]]; in other theories, its existence can be deduced. Many possible properties of sets are [[vacuously true]] for the empty set.\n\n''[[Null set]]'' is a distinct notion within the context of [[measure theory]]. In that setting, it describes a set of measure zero; such a set is not necessarily empty.  The empty set may also be called the ''void set''.\n\n==Notation==\n{{Main|Null sign}}\n[[Image:Empty set.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|A symbol for the empty set]]\nCommon notations for the empty set include \"{}\", \"<math>\\emptyset</math>\", and \"\u2205\". The latter two symbols were introduced by the [[Bourbaki group]] (specifically [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]) in 1939, inspired by the letter [[\u00d8]] in the [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] and [[Danish orthography|Danish]] alphabets (and not related in any way to the Greek letter [[phi (letter)|\u03a6]]).<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic.]</ref> In the past, \"0\" was occasionally used as a symbol for the empty set, but this is now considered to be an improper use of notation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=007054235X|edition=3rd|pages=300}}</ref>\n\nThe symbol \u2205 is available at [[Unicode]] point U+2205.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2200.pdf Unicode Standard 5.2]</ref> It can be coded in [[HTML]] as <tt>&emptyset;</tt> and as <tt>&amp;#8709;</tt>. It can be coded in [[LaTeX]] as <tt>\\varnothing</tt>. The symbol <math>\\emptyset</math> is coded in LaTeX as <tt>\\emptyset</tt>.\n\n== Properties ==\nIn standard [[axiomatic set theory]], by the [[axiom of extensionality|principle of extensionality]], two sets are equal if they have the same elements; therefore there can be only one set with no elements. Hence there is but one empty set, and we speak of \"the empty set\" rather than \"an empty set\".\n\nThe mathematical symbols employed below are explained [[table of mathematical symbols|here]].\n\n[[For any]] set ''A'':\n* The empty set is a [[subset]] of ''A'':\n*:<math>\\forall A: \\varnothing  \\subseteq A</math>\n* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of ''A'' with the empty set is ''A'':\n*:<math>\\forall A: A \\cup \\varnothing  = A</math>\n* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ''A'' with the empty set is the empty set:\n*:<math>\\forall A: A \\cap \\varnothing  = \\varnothing </math>\n* The [[Cartesian product]] of ''A'' and the empty set is the empty set:\n*:<math>\\forall A: A \\times \\varnothing  = \\varnothing </math>\n\nThe empty set has the following properties:\n* Its only subset is the empty set itself:\n*:<math>\\forall A: A \\subseteq \\varnothing  \\Rightarrow A = \\varnothing </math>\n* The [[power set]] of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set:\n*:<math>2^{\\varnothing } = \\{\\varnothing\\}</math>\n* Its number of elements (that is, its [[cardinality]]) is zero:\n*:<math>\\mathrm{card}(\\varnothing) = 0</math>\n\nThe connection between the empty set and zero goes further, however: in the standard [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]], sets are used to [[model theory|model]] the natural numbers. In this context, zero is modelled by the empty set.\n\nFor any [[property (philosophy)|property]]:\n* For every element of <math>\\varnothing</math> the property holds ([[vacuous truth]]);\n* There is no element of <math>\\varnothing</math> for which the property holds.\n\nConversely, if for some property and some set ''V'', the following two statements hold:\n* For every element of ''V'' the property holds;\n* There is no element of ''V'' for which the property holds,\n:then <math>V = \\varnothing</math>.\n\nBy the definition of [[subset]], the empty set is a subset of any set ''A''. That is, ''every'' element ''x'' of <math>\\varnothing</math> belongs to ''A''. Indeed, if it were not true that every element of <math>\\varnothing</math> is in ''A'' then there would be at least one element of <math>\\varnothing</math> that is not present in ''A''. Since there are ''no'' elements of <math>\\varnothing</math> at all, there is no element of <math>\\varnothing</math> that is not in ''A''. Any statement that begins \"for every element of <math>\\varnothing</math>\" is not making any substantive claim; it is a [[vacuous truth]]. This is often paraphrased as \"everything is true of the elements of the empty set.\"\n\n=== Operations on the empty set ===\n\nWhen speaking of the [[summation|sum]] of the elements of a finite set, one is inevitably led to the convention that the sum of the elements of the empty set is zero. The reason for this is that zero is the [[identity element]] for addition. Similarly, the [[multiplication|product]] of the elements of the empty set should be considered to be [[1 (number)|one]] (see [[empty product]]), since one is the identity element for multiplication.\n\nA [[derangement]] is a [[permutation]] of a set without [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s.  The empty set can be considered a derangement of itself, because it has only one permutation (<math>0!=1</math>), and it is vacuously true that no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position.\n\n==In other areas of mathematics==\n=== Extended real numbers ===\n\nSince the empty set has no members, when it is considered as a subset of any [[ordered set]], then every member of that set will be an upper bound and lower bound for the empty set. For example, when considered as a subset of the real numbers, with its usual ordering, represented by the [[real number line]], every real number is both an upper and lower bound for the empty set.<ref>Bruckner, A.N., Bruckner, J.B., and Thomson, B.S., 2008. ''[http://classicalrealanalysis.com/download.aspx Elementary Real Analysis]'', 2nd ed. Prentice Hall. P. 9.</ref> When considered as a subset of the [[extended reals]] formed by adding two \"numbers\" or \"points\" to the real numbers, namely [[negative infinity]], denoted <math>-\\infty\\!\\,,</math> which is defined to be less than every other extended real number, and [[positive infinity]], denoted <math>+\\infty\\!\\,,</math> which is defined to be greater than every other extended real number, then: \n\n:<math>\\sup\\varnothing=\\min(\\{-\\infty, +\\infty \\} \\cup \\mathbb{R})=-\\infty,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\inf\\varnothing=\\max(\\{-\\infty, +\\infty \\} \\cup \\mathbb{R})=+\\infty.</math>\n\nThat is, the least upper bound (sup or [[supremum]]) of the empty set is negative infinity, while the greatest lower bound (inf or [[infimum]]) is positive infinity. By analogy with the above, in the domain of the extended reals, negative infinity is the identity element for the maximum and supremum operators, while positive infinity is the identity element for minimum and infimum.\n\n=== Topology ===\nIn any [[topological space]] ''X'', the empty set is [[open set|open]] by definition, as is ''X''. Since the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is [[closed set|closed]] and the empty set and ''X'' are complements of each other, the empty set is also closed, making it a [[clopen set]]. Moreover, the empty set is [[compact set|compact]] by the fact that every [[finite set]] is compact.\n\nThe [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the empty set is empty. This is known as \"preservation of [[nullary]] [[union (set theory)|unions]].\"\n\n=== Category theory ===\nIf ''A'' is a set, then there exists precisely one [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from {} to ''A'', the [[empty function]]. As a result, the empty set is the unique [[initial object]] of the [[category theory|category]] of sets and functions.\n\nThe empty set can be turned into a [[topological space]], called the empty space, in just one way: by defining the empty set to be [[open set|open]]. This empty topological space is the unique initial object in the [[category of topological spaces]] with [[continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]]. In fact, it is a [[strict initial object]]: only the empty set has a function to the empty set.\n\n=== Set theory ===\nIn the [[von Neumann ordinal|von Neumann construction of the ordinals]], 0 is defined as the empty set, and the successor of an ordinal is defined as <math>S(\\alpha)=\\alpha\\cup\\{\\alpha\\}</math>. Thus, we have <math>0=\\varnothing</math>, <math>1 = 0\\cup\\{0\\}=\\{\\varnothing\\}</math>, <math>2=1\\cup\\{1\\}=\\{\\{\\varnothing\\},\\varnothing\\}</math>, and so on.  The von Neumann construction, along with the [[axiom of infinity]], which guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, can be used to construct the set of natural numbers, <math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math>, such that the [[Peano axioms]] of arithmetic are satisfied.\n\n==Questioned existence==\n=== Axiomatic set theory ===\nIn [[Zermelo set theory]], the existence of the empty set is assured by the [[axiom of empty set]], and its uniqueness follows from the [[axiom of extensionality]]. However, the axiom of empty set can be shown redundant in either of two ways:\n*There is already an axiom implying the existence of at least one set. Given such an axiom together with the [[axiom of separation]], the existence of the empty set is easily proved.\n*In the presence of [[urelement]]s, it is easy to prove that at least one set exists, viz. the set of all urelements (assuming there is not a proper class of them). Again, given the [[axiom of separation]], the empty set is easily proved.\n\n=== Philosophical issues ===\nWhile the empty set is a standard and widely accepted mathematical concept, it remains an [[ontological]] curiosity, whose meaning and usefulness are debated by philosophers and logicians.\n\nThe empty set is not the same thing as ''[[nothing]]''; rather, it is a set with nothing ''inside'' it and a set is always ''something''. This issue can be overcome by viewing a set as a bag\u2014an empty bag undoubtedly still exists. Darling (2004) explains that the empty set is not nothing, but rather \"the set of all triangles with four sides, the set of all numbers that are bigger than nine but smaller than eight, and the set of all [[chess opening|opening moves]] in [[chess]] that involve a [[king (chess)|king]].\"<ref name=\"Darling\" />\n\nThe popular [[syllogism]]\n:Nothing is better than eternal happiness; a ham sandwich is better than nothing; therefore, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness\nis often used to demonstrate the philosophical relation between the concept of nothing and the empty set. Darling writes that the contrast can be seen by rewriting the statements \"Nothing is better than eternal happiness\" and \"[A] ham sandwich is better than nothing\" in a mathematical tone. According to Darling, the former is equivalent to \"The set of all things that are better than eternal happiness is <math>\\varnothing</math>\" and the latter to \"The set {ham sandwich} is better than the set <math>\\varnothing</math>\". It is noted that the first compares elements of sets, while the second compares the sets themselves.<ref name=\"Darling\">{{cite book|title=The universal book of mathematics|author=D. J. Darling|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2004|isbn=0-471-27047-4|page=106}}</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Lowe]] argues that while the empty set:\n:\"...was undoubtedly an important landmark in the history of mathematics, \u2026 we should not assume that its utility in calculation is dependent upon its actually denoting some object.\"\n\nit is also the case that:\n:\"All that we are ever informed about the empty set is that it (1) is a set, (2) has no members, and (3) is unique amongst sets in having no members. However, there are very many things that 'have no members', in the set-theoretical sense&mdash;namely, all non-sets. It is perfectly clear why these things have no members, for they are not sets. What is unclear is how there can be, uniquely amongst sets, a ''set'' which has no members. We cannot conjure such an entity into existence by mere stipulation.\"<ref name=\"Lowe\">{{cite book|title=Locke|author=E. J.

This is an example of an endomorphism that is not an [[automorphism]].]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''endomorphism''' is a [[morphism]] (or [[homomorphism]]) from a [[mathematical object]] to itself.  For example, an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] {{math|''V''}} is a [[linear map]] {{math|''f'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}}, and an endomorphism of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] {{math|''G''}} is a [[group homomorphism]] {{math|''f'': ''G'' \u2192 ''G''}}. In general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any [[category theory|category]]. In the [[category of sets]], endomorphisms are functions from a set ''S'' to itself.\n\nIn any category, the [[function composition|composition]] of any two endomorphisms of {{math|''X''}} is again an endomorphism of {{math|''X''}}.  It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of {{math|''X''}} forms a [[monoid]], denoted {{math|End(''X'')}} (or {{math|End{{sub|''C''}}(''X'')}} to emphasize the category {{math|''C''}}).\n\n==Automorphisms==\n{{main|Automorphism}}\nAn [[inverse element|invertible]] endomorphism of {{math|''X''}} is called an [[automorphism]].  The set of all automorphisms is a [[subset]] of {{math|End(''X'')}} with a [[group (mathematics)|group]] structure, called the [[automorphism group]] of {{math|''X''}} and denoted {{math|Aut(''X'')}}.  In the following diagram, the arrows denote implication:\n{| style=\"border:none;\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"42%\" | [[Automorphism]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\" | \u21d2\n| align=\"center\" width=\"42%\" | [[Isomorphism]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | \u21d3\n|\n| align=\"center\" | \u21d3\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | Endomorphism\n| align=\"center\" | \u21d2\n| align=\"center\" | [[Homomorphism|(Homo)morphism]]\n|}\n\n==Endomorphism ring==\n{{main|Endomorphism ring}}\nAny two endomorphisms of an [[abelian group]], {{math|''A''}}, can be added together by the rule {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''(''a'') + ''g''(''a'')}}.  Under this addition, and with multiplication being defined as function composition, the endomorphisms of an abelian group form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (the [[endomorphism ring]]).  For example, the set of endomorphisms of {{math|\u2124{{sup|''n''}}}} is the ring of all {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with integer entries.  The endomorphisms of a vector space or [[module (mathematics)|module]] also form a ring, as do the endomorphisms of any object in a [[preadditive category]].  The endomorphisms of a nonabelian group generate an algebraic structure known as a [[near-ring]]. Every ring with one is the endomorphism ring of its [[regular module]], and so is a subring of an endomorphism ring of an abelian group;<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2.</ref> however there are rings that are not the endomorphism ring of any abelian group.\n\n==Operator theory==\nIn any [[concrete category]], especially for [[vector space]]s, endomorphisms are maps from a set into itself, and may be interpreted as [[unary operator]]s on that set, [[action (group theory)|acting]] on the elements, and allowing to define the notion of [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s of elements, etc.\n\nDepending on the additional structure defined for the category at hand ([[topology]], [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], ...), such operators can have properties like [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]], [[Bounded function|boundedness]], and so on.  More details should be found in the article about [[operator theory]].\n\n==Endofunctions==\nAn '''endofunction''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is equal to its [[codomain]]. A [[homomorphism|homomorphic]] endofunction is an endomorphism.\n\nLet {{math|''S''}} be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on {{math|''S''}} one finds [[permutation]]s of {{math|''S''}} and constant functions associating to every {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''S''}} the same {{math|''c'' \u2208 ''S''}}.  Every permutation of {{math|''S''}} has the codomain equal to its domain and is [[bijection|bijective]] and invertible. A constant function on {{math|''S''}}, if {{math|''S''}} has more than 1 element, has an image that is a proper subset of its codomain, is not bijective (and non invertible). The function associating to each natural integer {{math|''n''}} the floor of {{math|''n''/2}} has its image equal to its codomain and is not invertible.\n\nFinite endofunctions are equivalent to [[directed pseudoforest]]s. For sets of size {{math|''n''}} there are {{math|''n''{{sup|''n''}}}} endofunctions on the set.\n\nParticular examples of bijective endofunctions are the [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s; i.e., the functions coinciding with their inverses.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adjoint endomorphism]]\n*[[Epimorphism]] (Surjective morphism)\n*[[Frobenius endomorphism]]\n*[[Monomorphism]] (Injective morphism)\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| year=2009| title=Basic algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 1 | series= | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47189-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Endomorphism|id=p/e035600}}\n* {{planetmath reference|id=7462|title=Endomorphism}}\n\n[[Category:Morphisms]]", "sha1": "70xk8hudg2m1pp3m7as7x9j699sguub"}}, {"title": "Electric Levantine", "ns": "0", "id": "9570", "redirect": {"title": "Murat Ses"}, "revision": {"id": "15907446", "parentid": "1446882", "timestamp": "2003-09-18T01:16:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lexor", "id": "5364"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Revert to last self-version, redirects to [[Murat Ses]].

Fearing he might lose it again, he seized on the opportunity to read as much as he could. His recovery proved permanent, but Hoffer never abandoned his reading habit.\n\nHoffer was a young man when he also lost his father. The [[cabinetmaker]]'s [[trade union|union]] paid for Knut Hoffer's funeral and gave Hoffer about $300 insurance money. He took a bus to [[Los Angeles]] and spent the next 10 years on [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]], reading, occasionally writing, and working at [[Handyman|odd jobs]].<ref>Truth Imagined</ref>\n\nIn 1931, he considered [[suicide]] by drinking a solution of [[oxalic acid]], but he could not bring himself to do it.<ref>[Truth Imagined p. 35-39]</ref> He left Skid Row and became a [[migrant worker]], following the [[harvest]]s in California.

Snowed in for the winter, he read the ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' by [[Michel de Montaigne]]. Montaigne impressed Hoffer deeply, and Hoffer often made reference to him. He also developed a respect for America's [[underclass]], which he said was \"lumpy with talent.\"\n\n==Career==\nHe wrote a novel, ''Four Years in Young Hank's Life,'' and a [[novella]], ''Chance and Mr. Kunze,'' both partly autobiographical.

Lili Fabilli Osborne died in 2010 at the age of 93.  Prior to her death, Osborne was the [[Executor|executor]] of Hoffer's estate, and vigorously controlled the rights to his [[intellectual property]].\n\n==Books and opinions==\n\n===''The True Believer''===\n{{main article|The True Believer}}\nHoffer came to public attention with the 1951 publication of his first book, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', which consists of a preface and 125 sections, which are divided into 18 chapters. Hoffer analyzes the phenomenon of \"mass movements,\" a general term that he applies to revolutionary parties, nationalistic movements, and religious movements. He summarizes his thesis in \u00a7113:  \"A movement is pioneered by men of words, materialized by fanatics and consolidated by men of actions.\"<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'' (New York: Harper & Row/Perennial Library, 1966), p. 134.</ref>\n\nHoffer argues that [[fanaticism|fanatical]] and extremist cultural movements, whether religious, social, or national, arise when large numbers of frustrated people, believing their own individual lives to be worthless or spoiled, join a movement demanding radical change. But the real attraction for this population is an escape from the self, not a realization of individual hopes:  \"A mass movement attracts and holds a following not because it can satisfy the desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy the passion for self-renunciation.\"<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'' (New York: Harper & Row/Perennial Library, 1966), p. 21.</ref>\n\nHoffer consequently argues that the appeal of mass movements is interchangeable: in the Germany of the 1920s and the 1930s, for example, the [[Communists]] and [[National Socialists]] were ostensibly enemies, but sometimes enlisted each other's members, since they competed for the same kind of marginalized, angry, frustrated people.  For the \"true believer,\" Hoffer argues that particular beliefs are less important than escaping from the burden of the autonomous self.\n\nHarvard historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] said of ''The True Believer'':  \"This brilliant and original inquiry into the nature of mass movements is a genuine contribution to our social thought.\"<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'' (Harper & Row/Perennial Library, 1966), back cover.</ref>\n\n===Later works===\nSubsequent to the publication of ''The True Believer'' (1951), Eric Hoffer touched upon Asia and American interventionism in several of his essays. In \"The Awakening of Asia\" (1954), published in ''The Reporter'' and later his book ''The Ordeal of Change'' (1963), Hoffer discusses the reasons for unrest on the continent. In particular, he argues that the root cause of social discontent in Asia was not government corruption, \"communist agitation,\" or the legacy of European colonial \"oppression and exploitation,\" but rather that a \"craving for pride\" was the central problem in Asia, suggesting a problem that could not be relieved through typical American intervention.<ref name=\"unz.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Reporter-1954jun22-00016|title=\"The Awakening of Asia\", by Eric Hoffer, ''The Reporter'', June 22, 1954, pp. 16-17|publisher=unz.org|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor centuries, Hoffer notes, Asia had \"submitted to one conqueror after another.\"  Throughout these centuries, Asia had \"been misruled, looted, and bled by both foreign and native oppressors without\" so much as \"a peep\" from the general population.  Though not without negative effect, corrupt governments and the legacy of European imperialism represented nothing new under the sun.  Indeed, the European colonial authorities had been \"fairly beneficent\" in Asia.<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nTo be sure, Communism exerted an appeal of sorts.  For the Asian \"pseudo-intellectual,\" it promised elite status and the phony complexities of \"doctrinaire double talk.\" For the ordinary Asian, it promised partnership with the seemingly emergent Soviet Union in a \"tremendous, unprecedented undertaking\" to build a better tomorrow.<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nAccording to Hoffer, however, Communism in Asia was dwarfed by the desire for pride.  To satisfy such desire, Asians would willingly and irrationally sacrifice their economic well-being and their lives as well.<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nUnintentionally, the West had created this appetite, causing \"revolutionary unrest\" in Asia.  The West had done so by eroding the traditional communal bonds that once had woven the individual to the patriarchal family, clan, tribe, \"cohesive rural or urban unit,\" and \"religious or political body.\"\n\nWithout the security and spiritual meaning produced by such bonds, Asians had been liberated from tradition only to find themselves now atomized, isolated, exposed, and abandoned, \"left orphaned and empty in a cold world.\"<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nCertainly, Europe had undergone a similar destruction of tradition, but it had occurred centuries earlier at the end of the medieval period and produced better results thanks to different circumstances.\n\nFor the Asians of the 1950s, the circumstances differed markedly.  Most were illiterate and impoverished, living in a world that included no expansive physical or intellectual vistas. Dangerously, the \"articulate minority\" of the Asian population inevitably disconnected themselves from the ordinary people, thereby failing to acquire \"a sense of usefulness and of worth\" that came by \"taking part in the world's work.\" As a result, they were \"condemned to the life of chattering posturing pseudo-intellectuals\" and coveted \"the illusion of weight and importance.\"<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nMost significantly, Hoffer asserts that the disruptive awakening of Asia came about as a result of an unbearable sense of weakness. Indeed, Hoffer discusses the problem of weakness, asserting that while \"power corrupts the few... weakness corrupts the many.\"<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nHoffer notes that \" the resentment of the weak does not spring from any injustice done them but from the sense of their inadequacy and impotence.\" In short, the weak \"hate not wickedness\" but themselves for being weak. Consequently, self-loathing produces explosive effects that cannot be mitigated through social engineering schemes, such as programs of wealth redistribution. In fact, American \"generosity\" is counterproductive, perceived in Asia simply as an example of Western \"oppression.\"<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nIn the wake of the [[Korean War]], Hoffer does not recommend exporting at gunpoint either American political institutions or mass democracy. In fact, Hoffer advances the possibility that winning over the multitudes of Asia may not even be desirable. If on the other hand, necessity truly dictates that for \"survival\" the United States must persuade the \"weak\" of Asia to \"our side,\" Hoffer suggests the wisest course of action would be to master \"the art or technique of sharing hope, pride, and as a last resort, hatred with others.\"<ref name=\"unz.org\" />\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], despite his objections to the antiwar movement and acceptance of the notion that the war was somehow necessary to prevent a [[third world war]], Hoffer remained skeptical concerning American interventionism, specifically the intelligence with which the war was being conducted in Southeast Asia. After the United States became involved in the war, Hoffer wished to avoid defeat in Vietnam because of his fear that such a defeat would transform American society for ill, opening the door to those who would preach a [[stab-in-the-back myth]] and allow for the rise of an American version of Hitler.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Eric Hoffer; an American odyssey|author=Tomkins, C.|date=1968|publisher=Dutton |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXZBAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Temper of Our Time'' (1967), Hoffer implies that the United States as a rule should avoid interventions in the first place: \"the better part of statesmanship might be to know clearly and precisely what not to do, and leave action to the improvisation of chance.\" In fact, Hoffer indicates that \"it might be wise to wait for enemies to defeat themselves,\" as they might fall upon each other with the United States out of the picture.<ref name=\"unz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/HofferEric-1967?View=ReadIt|title=The Temper of Our Time (1967) by Eric Hoffer|publisher=unz.org|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> The view was somewhat borne out with the [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War]] and [[Chinese-Vietnamese War]] of the late 1970s.\n\nIn May 1968, about a year after the [[Six-Day War]], he wrote an article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' titled \"Israel's Peculiar Position:\"\n{{quote|The Jews are a peculiar people: things permitted to other nations are forbidden to the Jews. Other nations drive out thousands, even millions of people and there is no refugee problem. Russia did it, Poland and Czechoslovakia did it.

But in the case of Israel, the displaced Arabs have become eternal refugees. Everyone insists that Israel must take back every single one.<ref name=Hoffer />}}\n\nHoffer asks why \"everyone expects the Jews to be the only real Christians in this world\" and why Israel should sue for peace after its victory.<ref name=Hoffer>{{cite web|title=Eric Hoffer and the Jews|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/126407/stakes-michael-ledeen |work=[[National Review]] |author=Eric Hoffer |date=July 31, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHoffer believed that rapid change is not necessarily a positive thing for a society and that too rapid change can cause a regression in maturity for those who were brought up in a different society. He noted that in America in the 1960s, many young adults were still living in extended adolescence. Seeking to explain the attraction of the [[New Left]] protest movements, he characterized them as the result of widespread affluence, which \"is robbing a modern society of whatever it has left of puberty rites to routinize the attainment of manhood.\" He saw the puberty rites as essential for self-esteem and noted that mass movements and juvenile mindsets tend to go together, to the point that anyone, no matter what age, who joins a mass movement immediately begins to exhibit juvenile behavior.\n\nHoffer further noted that working-class Americans rarely joined protest movements and subcultures since they had entry into meaningful labor as an effective rite of passage out of adolescence while both the very poor who lived on welfare and the affluent were, in his words, \"prevented from having a share in the world's work, and of proving their manhood by doing a man's work and getting a man's pay\" and thus remained in a state of extended adolescence. Lacking in necessary self-esteem, they were prone to joining mass movements as a form of compensation. Hoffer suggested that the need for meaningful work as a [[rite of passage]] into adulthood could be fulfilled with a two-year civilian national service program (like programs during the [[Great Depression]] such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]): \"The routinization of the passage from boyhood to manhood would contribute to the solution of many of our pressing problems. I cannot think of any other undertaking that would dovetail so many of our present difficulties into opportunities for growth.\"\n\nHoffer appeared on public television in 1964 and then in two one-hour conversations on [[CBS]] with [[Eric Sevareid]] in the late 1960s.\n\n==Papers==\nHoffer's papers, including 131 of the notebooks he carried in his pockets, were acquired in 2000 by the [[Hoover Institution]] Archives.

Merger Treaty.<br />\u00b2 The political centres were [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] and [[Strasbourg]], later also [[Brussels]].<br>\u00b3 Initial founding languages, before the merger and subsequent enlargements, were Dutch, French, German and Italian.\n}}\nThe '''European Coal and Steel Community''' ('''ECSC''') was an [[international organization|organisation]] of six European countries created after [[World War II]] to regulate their industrial production under a centralised authority. It was formally established in 1951 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed by [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[West Germany]].  The ECSC was the first international organisation to be based on the principles of [[supranationalism]],<ref name=\"ENA TEC\" /> and started the process of formal integration which ultimately led to the [[European Union]].\n\nThe ECSC was first proposed by French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between [[France]] and [[Germany]]. He declared his aim was to \"make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm|title=EUROPA - The Schuman Declaration \u2013 9 May 1950|work=europa.eu}}</ref> which was to be achieved by regional integration, of which the ECSC was the first step. The Treaty would create a [[common market]] for [[coal]] and [[steel]] among its member states which served to neutralise competition between European nations over natural resources, particularly in the [[Ruhr]].\n\nThe ECSC was overseen by four institutions: a [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] composed of independent appointees, a Common Assembly composed of national parliamentarians, a Special Council composed of national ministers, and a Court of Justice. These would ultimately form the blueprint for today's [[European Commission]], [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Court of Justice]].\n\nThe ECSC stood as a model for the communities set up after it by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the [[European Economic Community]] and [[European Atomic Energy Community]], with whom it shared its membership and some [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]]. The 1967 [[Merger Treaty|Merger (Brussels) Treaty]] led all of ECSC's institutions to merge into the [[European Economic Community]], but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality. In 2002, the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form, its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of the Amsterdam and Nice treaties.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of the European Coal and Steel Community (1945\u201357)}}\nAs [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and [[Foreign Minister of France|Foreign Minister]], Schuman was instrumental in turning French policy away from the [[Gaullist]] policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the [[Ruhr]] or the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]]. Despite stiff [[ultra-nationalist]], Gaullist and communist opposition, the [[French National Assembly|French Assembly]] voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The [[International Authority for the Ruhr]] changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states ([[international democracy]]), not the power politics of domination.\n\n===Schuman declaration===\nThe [[Schuman Declaration]] of 9 May 1950 (in 1985 declared \"[[Europe Day]]\" by the [[European Communities]]) occurred after two Cabinet meetings, when the proposal became French government policy. France was thus the first government to agree to surrender sovereignty in a supranational Community. That decision was based on a text, written and edited by Schuman's friend and colleague, the [[French Foreign Ministry|Foreign Ministry]] lawyer, professor [[Paul Reuter (politician)|Paul Reuter]] with the assistance of economist [[Jean Monnet]] and Schuman's Directeur de Cabinet, [[Bernard Clappier]]. It laid out a plan for a European Community to pool the coal and steel of its members in a [[common market]].\n\nSchuman proposed that \"Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organisation open to the participation of the other countries of Europe\". Such an act was intended to help economic growth and cement peace between France and Germany, who were [[French\u2013German enmity|historic enemies]]. Coal and steel were vital resources needed for a country to wage war, so pooling those resources between two such enemies was seen as more than symbolic.<ref name=\"ENA TEC\"/><ref name=\"EC TE-ECSC\"/> Schuman saw the decision of the French government on his proposal as the first example of a democratic and [[supranational]] Community, a new development in world history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schuman.info/UN4849.htm|title=Schuman Project|work=schuman.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schuman.info/Strasbourg549.htm|title=Schuman Project|work=schuman.info}}</ref> The plan was also seen by some, like Monnet, who crossed out Reuter's mention of \"[[supranational]]\" in the draft and inserted \"[[federation]]\", as a first step to a \"[[United States of Europe|European federation]]\".<ref name=\"ENA TEC\">{{cite web|title=The European Communities|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_european_communities-en-3940ef1d-7c10-4d0f-97fc-0cf1e86a32d4.html|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"EC TE-ECSC\"/>\n\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Schuman]] delivering his speech on 9 May 1950]] -->\nThe [[Schuman Declaration]] that created the ECSC had several distinct aims:\n* It would mark the birth of a united Europe.\n* It would make war between member states impossible.\n* It would encourage world peace.\n* It would transform Europe in a \"step by step\" process (building through sectoral [[supranational]] communities) leading to the unification of Europe democratically, unifying two political blocks separated by the [[Iron Curtain]].\n* It would create the world's first [[supranational]] institution.\n* It would create the world's first international anti-cartel agency.\n* It would create a common market across the Community.\n* It would, starting with the coal and steel sector, revitalise the whole European economy by similar community processes.\n* It would improve the world economy and the developing countries, such as those in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schuman.info/proppurp.htm|title=Schuman Project|work=schuman.info}}</ref>\n\nFirstly, it was intended to prevent further war between France and Germany and other states<ref name=\"robert-schuman.eu\">[http://www.robert-schuman.eu/declaration_9mai.php Declaration of 9 May 1950] Fondation Robert Schuman</ref> by tackling the root cause of war.<ref name=\"robert-schuman.eu\"/> The ECSC was primarily conceived with France and Germany in mind: \"The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries.\"<ref name=\"robert-schuman.eu\"/> The coal and steel industries being essential for the production of munitions, Schuman believed that by uniting these two industries across France and Germany under an innovative supranational system that also included a European anti-[[cartel]] agency, he could \"make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\".<ref>[http://www.schuman.info/9MayProp.htm#war Robert Schuman's proposal of 9 May 1950] Schuman Project</ref> Schuman had another aim: \"With increased resources Europe will be able to pursue the achievement of one of its essential tasks, namely, the development of the African continent.\"<ref name=\"robert-schuman.eu\"/> Industrial cartels tended to impose \"restrictive practices\"<ref name=\"robert-schuman.eu\"/> on national markets, whereas the ECSC would ensure the increased production necessary for their ambitions in Africa.\n\n{{EU history}}\n\n===Political pressures===\nIn West Germany, Schuman kept the closest contacts with the new generation of democratic politicians. [[Karl Arnold]], the Minister President of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], the state that included the coal and steel producing [[The ruhr|Ruhr]], was initially spokesman for German foreign affairs. He gave a number of speeches and broadcasts on a supranational coal and steel community at the same time as Robert Schuman began to propose this Community in 1948 and 1949. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ({{lang-de|Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands}}, SPD), in spite of support from unions and other socialists in Europe, decided it would oppose the Schuman plan. [[Kurt Schumacher]]'s personal distrust of France, capitalism, and [[Konrad Adenauer]] aside, he claimed that a focus on integrating with a \"Little Europe of the Six\" would override the SPD's prime objective of German reunification and thus empower ultra-nationalist and Communist movements in democratic countries. He also thought the ECSC would end any hopes of nationalising the steel industry and lock in a Europe of \"cartels, clerics and conservatives\".<ref name=Orlow2002>{{cite book|author=Orlow, D.|year = 2002|pages=168\u2013172|title = Common Destiny: A Comparative History of the Dutch, French, and German Social Democratic Parties, 1945\u20131969|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn =978-1571811851 }}</ref> Younger members of the party like [[Carlo Schmid (German politician)|Carlo Schmid]], were, however, in favor of the Community and pointed to the long socialist support for the supranational idea.\n\nIn France, Schuman had gained strong political and intellectual support from all sections of the nation and many non-communist parties. Notable amongst these were ministerial colleague [[Andre Philip]], president of the Foreign Relations Committee [[Edouard Bonnefous]], and former prime minister, [[Paul Reynaud]]. Projects for a coal and steel authority and other supranational communities were formulated in specialist subcommittees of the Council of Europe in the period before it became French government policy. [[Charles de Gaulle]], who was then out of power, had been an early supporter of \"linkages\" between economies, on French terms, and had spoken in 1945 of a \"European confederation\" that would exploit the resources of the [[Ruhr]]. However, he opposed the ECSC as a ''faux'' (false) pooling (\"''le pool, ce faux semblant''\") because he considered it an unsatisfactory \"piecemeal approach\" to European unity and because he considered the French government \"too weak\" to dominate the ECSC as he thought proper.<ref name=Chopra1974>{{cite book|author=Chopra, H.S.|year = 1974|title = De Gaulle and European unity|pages = 28\u201333|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn = }}</ref> De Gaulle also felt that the ECSC had insufficient supranational authority because the Assembly was not ratified by a European referendum and he did not accept [[Raymond Aron]]'s contention that the ECSC was intended as a movement away from United States domination. Consequently, de Gaulle and his followers in the [[Rally of the French People|RPF]] voted against ratification in the [[National Assembly of France|lower house of the French Parliament]].<ref name=Chopra1974/>\n\nDespite these attacks and those from the extreme left, the ECSC found substantial public support, and so it was established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.\n\n===Treaties===\n[[File:Oprichtingsverdrag EGKS NL-HaNA 2.02.20 10123.jpg|thumb|left]]\n\nThe 100-article [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], which established the ECSC, was signed on 18 April 1951 by \"the [[inner six]]\": France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg ([[Benelux]]). The ECSC was the first international organisation to be based on [[supranational]] principles<ref name=\"ENA TEC\"/> and was, through the establishment of a common market for coal and steel, intended to expand the economies, increase employment, and raise the standard of living within the Community. The market was also intended to progressively rationalise the distribution of high level production whilst ensuring stability and employment. The common market for coal was opened on 10 February 1953, and for steel on 1 May 1953.<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/> Upon taking effect, the ECSC gradually replaced the [[International Authority for the Ruhr]].<ref>[http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1952Jan/reference/history.omg1952jan.i0023.pdf Office of the US High Commissioner for Germany Office of Public Affairs, Public Relations Division, APO 757, US Army, January 1952] \"Plans for terminating international authority for the Ruhr\", pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nOn 11 August 1952, the United States was the first non-ECSC member to recognise the Community and stated it would now deal with the ECSC on coal and steel matters, establishing its delegation in Brussels. Monnet responded by choosing [[Washington, D.C.]] as the site of the ECSC's first external presence. The headline of the delegation's first bulletin read \"Towards a Federal Government of Europe\".<ref>[http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=37 Washington Delegation History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825121612/http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=37 |date=25 August 2008 }}, Delegation of the European Commission to the United States</ref>\n\nSix years after the Treaty of Paris, the [[Treaties of Rome]] were signed by the six ECSC members, creating the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom). These Communities were based, with some adjustments, on the ECSC. The Treaties of Rome were to be in force indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to expire after fifty years. These two new Communities worked on the creation of a [[customs union]] and [[nuclear power]] community respectively.<ref name=\"ENA TEC\"/> The Rome treaties were hurried through just before de Gaulle was given emergency powers and proclaimed the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Despite his efforts to \"chloroform\" the Communities, their fields rapidly expanded and the EEC became the most important tool for political unification, overshadowing the ECSC.<ref name=\"ENA TEC\"/>\n\n===Merger and expiration===\nDespite being separate [[legal personality|legal entities]], the ECSC, EEC and Euratom initially shared the [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]] and the [[European Court of Justice]], although the [[Council of the European Union|Councils]] and the [[European Commission|High Authority/Commissions]] remained separate. To avoid duplication, the [[Merger Treaty]] merged these separate bodies of the ECSC and Euratom with the EEC. The EEC later became one of the [[Three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] of the present day European Union.<ref name=\"ENA TEC\"/>\n\nThe Treaty of Paris was frequently amended as the EC and EU evolved and [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanded]]. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate began at the beginning of the 1990s on what to do with it. It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the [[Treaty of Rome]] and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the [[Treaty of Nice]]. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002.<ref name=\"EC TE-ECSC\">{{cite web|title=Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, ECSC Treaty|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/treaties/ecsc_en.htm|accessdate=16 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213202339/http://europa.eu/scadplus/treaties/ecsc_en.htm|archivedate=13 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> That day, the [[Flag of the European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC flag]] was lowered for the final time outside the [[European Commission]] in [[Brussels]] and replaced with the [[Flag of Europe|EU flag]].<ref name=\"ENA FLAG\">{{cite web|title=Ceremony to mark the expiry of the ECSC Treaty (Brussels, 23&nbsp;July 2002)|date=23 July 2002|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/ceremony_to_mark_the_expiry_of_the_ecsc_treaty_brussels_23_july_2002-en-5fc19504-48f9-4cba-adde-70629a43f606.html|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline of treaties===\n{{EU evolution timeline}}\n\n==Institutions==\n{{Further|Institutions of the European Union}}\nThe institutions of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing civil society. This was the first international representation of consumers in history. These institutions were merged in 1967 with those of the European Community, which then governed the ECSC,<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\">{{cite web|title=The Treaties establishing the European Communities|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_treaties_establishing_the_european_communities-en-4a537592-d9d0-41a7-853a-f6cd74aed386.html|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.<ref name=\"ENA CC\"/>\n\nThe Treaty stated that the [[Location of European Union institutions|location of the institutions]] would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was hotly contested. As a temporary compromise, the institutions were provisionally located in the [[Luxembourg (city)|City of Luxembourg]], despite the Assembly being based in [[Strasbourg]].<ref name=\"ENA seats\">{{cite web|first=|title=The seats of the institutions of the European Union|date=|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_seats_of_the_institutions_of_the_european_union-en-cd672879-aeb1-4cad-a0c1-9e4ff75ff660.html|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===High Authority===\n[[File:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|Headquarters of the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] in Luxembourg]]\n{{Main|High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community}}\nThe High Authority (the predecessor to the [[European Commission]]) was a nine-member executive body which governed the Community. The Authority consisted of nine members in office for a term of six years. Eight of these members were appointed by the governments of the six signatories.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dedman|first=Martin|title=The Origins and Development of the European Union|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN|isbn=978-0-415-43561-1|pages=60}}</ref> These eight members then themselves appointed a ninth person to be [[President of the European Commission|President of the High Authority]].<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/>\n\nDespite being appointed by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to pledge not to represent their [[national interest]], but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office.<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/> To further ensure impartiality, one third of the membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).\n\nThe Authority's principal innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area of competence to ensure the objectives of the treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three [[Law of the European Union#Legislation|types of legal instruments]]: [[Regulation (European Union)|Decisions]], which were entirely binding laws; [[Directive (European Union)|Recommendations]], which had binding aims but the methods were left to [[member states]]; and Opinions, which had no legal force.<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/>\n\nUp to the merger in 1967, the authority had five Presidents followed by an interim President serving for the final days.<ref name=\"ENA HAC\">{{cite web|title=Members of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/members_of_the_high_authority_of_the_european_coal_and_steel_community_ecsc-en-dc703b1e-de8e-4dd9-afeb-cb0c1fdf31de.html|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=50%\n!

The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected \"by universal suffrage\" (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the [[Treaties of Rome]] and no actual election [[European Parliament election, 1979|until 1979]], as Rome required agreement in the Council on the [[electoral system]] first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term \"representatives of the peoples\".<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/> The Assembly was not originally specified in the [[Schuman Plan]] because it was hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe. When this became impossible because of British objections, separate institutions had to be created. The Assembly was intended as a democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority for incompetence, injustice, corruption or fraud. The first [[President of the European Parliament|President]] (akin to a Speaker) was [[Paul-Henri Spaak]].<ref name=\"ENA multi\">{{cite web | title = Negotiations on the ECSC Treaty : Multilateral negotiations | publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]] | url =http://www.cvce.eu/obj/negotiations_on_the_ecsc_treaty-en-dde9a336-6df6-40f5-902a-417ecda702e0.html|accessdate =4 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe Special Council of Ministers (equivalent to the current [[Council of the European Union]]) was composed of representatives of national governments. The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] was held by each state for a period of three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments, which were still responsible for the state's general economic policies. The Council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority.<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/> Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the High Authority, and in these areas the Council (unlike the modern Council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the Council.<ref name=\"ENA history\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_council_of_the_european_union-en-de23700c-e50a-4e0e-a7de-80665e4caf9f.html|accessdate =4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Court of Justice was to ensure the observation of ECSC law along with the interpretation and application of the Treaty. The Court was composed of seven judges, appointed by common accord of the national governments for six years. There were no requirements that the judges had to be of a certain nationality, simply that they be qualified and that their independence be beyond doubt. The Court was assisted by two Advocates General.<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/>\n\nThe Consultative Committee (similar to the [[Economic and Social Committee]]) had between 30 and 50 members equally divided between producers, workers, consumers and dealers in the coal and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed for two years and were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed.<ref name=\"ENA TEEC\"/> The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.<ref name=\"ENA CC\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|title =\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee and ECSC Consultative Committee |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_economic_and_social_committee_and_ecsc_consultative_committee-en-591d6c9e-8031-460a-9546-1f57f72344a7.html|accessdate =4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Achievements and failures==\nIts mission (article 2) was general: to \"contribute to the expansion of the economy, the development of employment and the improvement of the standard of living\" of its citizens. The Community had little effect on coal and steel ''production'', which was influenced more by global trends. Trade between members did increase (tenfold for steel) which saved members' money by not having to import resources from the United States. The High Authority also issued 280 modernization loans to the industry which helped the industry to improve output and reduce costs. Costs were further reduced by the abolition of tariffs at borders.<ref name=\"Mathieu\">{{cite web|last=Mathieu|first=Gilbert|title=The history of the ECSC: good times and bad|work=Le Monde |location=France, accessed on [[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|date=9 May 1970|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_history_of_the_ecsc_good_times_and_bad_from_le_monde_9_may_1970-en-54f09b32-1b0c-4060-afb3-5e475dcafda8.html|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAmong the ECSC's greatest achievements are those on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers to buy a home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150&nbsp;million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.<ref name=\"Mathieu\"/>\n\nFar more important than creating Europe's first social and regional policy, it is argued{{By whom|date=February 2018}} that the ECSC introduced European peace. It involved the continent's first European tax. This was a flat tax, a levy on production with a maximum rate of one percent. Given that the European Community countries are now experiencing the longest period of peace in more than seventy years,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=David H|title=Mr|url=http://www.schuman.info|website=Shuman project|publisher=info.schuman.info|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} this has been described as the cheapest tax for peace in history. Another world war, or \"world suicide\" as Schuman called this threat in 1949, was avoided. In October 1953 Schuman said that the possibility of another European war had been eliminated. Reasoning had to prevail among member states.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nHowever the ECSC failed to achieve several fundamental aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel groups such as the ''Konzerne'', which helped [[Adolf Hitler]] rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent [[price fixing]] (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The [[Euratom]] treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at [[Messina]] in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition in a short period of time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.<ref name=\"Mathieu\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Energy Community]]\n* [[Energy policy of the European Union]]\n* [[Flag of the European Coal and Steel Community]]\n* [[History of the European Union]]\n* [[History of the Ruhr District]]\n* [[Industrial plans for Germany]]\n* [[Monnet plan]]\n* [[Schuman Declaration]]\n* [[Supranationalism]]\n* [[Supranational union]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Grin | first = Gilles | year = 2003 | title = The Battle of the Single European Market: Achievements and Economic Thought, 1945\u20132000 | publisher=Kegan Paul | isbn = 978-0-7103-0938-9}}\n* {{cite book | last = Hitchcock | first = William I. | year = 1998 | title = France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944\u20131954 | publisher=University of North Carolina Press | isbn = 0-8078-4747-X}}\n* {{cite book | last = Maas | first = Willem | year = 2007 | title = Creating European Citizens | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | isbn = 978-0-7425-5485-6}}\n* {{Cite book | title = Schuman or Monnet?
