He was created by screenwriter [[Terry Nation]], originally for the 1975 serial ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]''. Davros is a major enemy of the series' protagonist, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], and is the creator of the Doctor's deadliest enemies, the [[Dalek]]s. Davros is a genius who has mastered many areas of science, but also a [[megalomania]]c who believes that through his creations he can become the supreme being and ruler of the Universe. The character has been compared to the infamous dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] several times, including by the actor [[Terry Molloy]],<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2005/03/15/features_davros_feature.shtml | title= Doctor Who: My life as Davros | work=BBC |accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref> while [[Julian Bleach]] defined him as a cross between Hitler and the renowned scientist [[Stephen Hawking]].<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2224999/Dr-Who-villain-Davros-a-cross-between-Stephen-Hawking-and-Hitler.html | title= Dr Who villain Davros - a cross between Stephen Hawking and Hitler | work=Telegraph Online | date=1 July 2008 | accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nDavros is from the planet [[Skaro]], whose people, the [[Kaled]]s, were engaged in a bitter thousand-year [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] with their enemies, the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]]. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] eye mounted on his forehead to take the place of his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile [[Life support|life-support]] chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair for more than a few minutes without dying. Davros' voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, [[staccatissimo]] speech of the Daleks.\n\n==Concept==\n{{Multiple images\n| align = right\n| footer = Davros, in the classic series and the revived series, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.\n| total_width = 500\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (30826729112).jpg\n| width1  =  4288\n| height1 = 2848\n| image2 = 270811-052 CPS (6276820345).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n}}\nDavros first appeared in the 1975 serial ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', written by [[Terry Nation]].

As chief scientist of the Kaleds and leader of their elite scientific division, Davros devised new military strategies in order to win his people's thousand-year war against the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]] race that also occupies Skaro. When Davros learned his people were evolving from exposure to [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[biological weapon]]s used in the war, he artificially accelerates the process to his design and stores the resulting tentacle creatures in tank-like \"Mark III travel machines\" partly based on the design of his wheelchair. He later names these creatures \"Daleks\", an [[anagram]] of Kaleds.\n\nDavros quickly becomes obsessed with his creations, considering them to be the ultimate form of life compared to others. When other Kaleds attempted to thwart his project, Davros arranges the extinction of his own people by using the Thals, whom he mostly killed with the Daleks later. Davros then weeds out those in elite scientific division who are loyal to him so he can have the Daleks eliminate the rest. But the Daleks ultimately turn on Davros, killing his supporters before shooting him when he tries to halt the Dalek production line.<ref>{{cite serial | title = [[Genesis of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One|BBC1]] | location = London | date=8 March \u2013 12 April 1975 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'', it is revealed that Davros (now played by [[David Gooderson]]) was not killed, but placed in [[suspended animation]] and buried underground. The Daleks unearth their creator to help them break a [[logic]]al impasse in their war against the [[android (robot)|android]] [[Movellan]]s.

The Daleks require Davros to find an [[antidote]] for a Movellan-created [[virus]] that has all but wiped them out. Believing his creations to be treacherous, Davros begins using [[mind control]] on Daleks and humans, ultimately releasing the virus to kill off the Daleks before they can exterminate him. Davros expresses a desire to build a new and improved race of Daleks. But he apparently succumbs to the virus himself before he can escape, his [[physiology]] being close enough to that of the Daleks for the virus to affect him.<ref>{{cite serial | title = [[Resurrection of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One|BBC1]] | location = London | date=8\u201315 February 1984}}</ref>\n\nBut in the [[Sixth Doctor]] story ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', Davros goes into hiding as \"The Great Healer\" of the funeral and [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] preservation centre Tranquil Repose on the planet Necros.

Both Skaro and the Imperial Dalek [[Mother ship|mothership]] are apparently destroyed (in the future) when the [[Seventh Doctor]] tricks Davros into using the [[Time Lord]] artefact known as the [[Hand of Omega]] which makes Skaro's Sun go supernova. However, a Dalek on the bridge of Davros' ship reports that the Emperor's escape pod is being launched and a white light is seen speeding away from the ship moments before its destruction, leaving a clear route to bring Davros back in the future.\n\n===The Time War and the Reality Bomb ===\n[[File:Davros Bleach.jpg|thumb|right|Davros, as he looked in both 2008 and 2015, played by [[Julian Bleach]]]]\nDuring the revived series, Davros was referred to in the episode \"[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]\" (2005) by the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]), who explains that the Daleks were created by \"a genius... a man who was king of his own little world\",<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Dalek |episode-link=Dalek (Doctor Who episode) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Robert Shearman]], Director [[Joe Ahearne]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=30 April 2005 |season= |series-no=1 |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> and again by the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) in the episode \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" (2007), where he refers to the Daleks' creator as believing that \"removing emotions makes you stronger\".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Evolution of the Daleks |episode-link=Evolution of the Daleks |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Helen Raynor]], Director [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=28 April 2007 |season= |series-no=3 |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Davros makes his first official appearance in the episode \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" (2008), portrayed by [[Julian Bleach]].

But Davros was pulled out of the time lock of the war by Dalek Caan (voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]]), using his own flesh to create a \"new empire\" of Daleks who place him in the Vault as their prisoner to make use of his knowledge. Under Davros' guidance, the Daleks steal 27 planets, including Earth, and hide them in the Medusa Cascade, one second out of sync with the rest of the universe.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Stolen Earth |episode-link=The Stolen Earth |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=28 June 2008 |season= |series-no=4 |number=12 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn the follow-up episode \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (2008), it is revealed that the stolen planets are required as a power source for Davros' ideal [[final solution]]: the reality bomb, which produces a wavelength that would cancel out the electrical field binding atoms to reduce all life outside the Crucible into nothingness in both his universe and countless other realities. But Davros learns too late that Dalek Caan, who came to the realisation of his race's atrocities as a consequence of saving his creator, used his prophecies and influence to ensure the Daleks' destruction while manipulating events to bring the Tenth Doctor and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) together for the role the latter would play. Though the Doctor attempts to save him, having earlier taunted the Doctor for turning his companions into killers and being the cause of the deaths of countless people during his travels, Davros furiously refuses the Doctor's help and accuses him of being responsible for the destruction while screaming: \"Never forget, Doctor, you did this! I name you forever: ''You'' are the Destroyer of Worlds!\" Thus the Doctor is forced to leave Davros to his fate as the Crucible self-destructs.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Journey's End |episode-link=Journey's End (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=5 July 2008 |season= |series-no=4 |number=13 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n=== Remembering the Twelfth Doctor ===\nDavros returns in the two-part Series 9 opening \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\" and \"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), having escaped the Crucible's destruction and ending up on a restored Skaro with his life being prolonged by the Daleks. But when the aged Davros' health begins to fail, he remembers his childhood self, played by Joey Price, meeting the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) during the Kaleds' thousand-year war prior to ''Genesis of the Daleks''. The young Davros finds himself lost on the battlefield and surrounded by handmines, with the Doctor throwing his [[sonic screwdriver]] to the boy with the intent to save him before learning his name and leaving the child to his fate. Davros, seeking a final revenge on the Doctor, employs Colony Sarff ([[Jami Reid-Quarrell]]) to bring him to Skaro.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Magician's Apprentice |episode-link=The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Steven Moffat]], Director [[Hettie MacDonald]], Producer [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=19 September 2015 |season= |series-no=9 |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> When it appears that the Doctor has lost his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) to the Daleks, Davros manages to trick the Doctor into using his regeneration energy to heal him, extending his own life while infusing every Dalek on Skaro with the energy.

The Doctor then discovers the Daleks have a concept of mercy and are allowed to have the word in their vocabulary when he encounters Clara having disguised herself in a Dalek's robotic chassis. The Doctor and Clara escape, the former having an epiphany as to how Davros somehow put a sliver of compassion into the Daleks. He then returns to the battlefield in Davros' childhood, using a Dalek gun to destroy the handmines with the one bit of compassion in Davros' life instilled in the Daleks' design to ensure Clara being saved.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Witch's Familiar |episode-link=The Witch's Familiar |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Steven Moffat]], Director [[Hettie MacDonald]], Producer [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=26 September 2015 |season= |series-no=9 |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n==Other appearances==\n\n===Comic strips===\n''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' printed several comics stories involving Davros. The first, \"Nemesis of the Daleks\" (#152\u2013155), with the Seventh Doctor, features an appearance of a Dalek Emperor. Speaking with the Emperor, the Doctor addresses him as Davros, but the Emperor responds \"Who is Davros?\" The Doctor initially assumes Davros' personality has been totally subsumed, but in the later strip \"[[Emperor of the Daleks]]\" (#197\u2013202) this Emperor is shown as a different entity from Davros. Set prior to ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' in Davros' timeline, but after in the timeline of the Doctor, the latter, accompanied by [[Bernice Summerfield]], together with help from the Sixth Doctor, ensures that Davros will survive the wrath of the Daleks so that he can assume the title of Emperor, allowing history to take its course. \"Up Above the Gods\" (#227), a vignette following up on this, features the Sixth Doctor and Davros having a conversation in the TARDIS.\n\n===Audio plays===\nTerry Molloy has reprised his role as Davros in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] [[radio drama|audio plays]] produced by [[Big Finish Productions]], mostly notably ''[[Davros (Doctor Who audio)|Davros]]'' (taking place during the [[Sixth Doctor]]'s era), which, through flashbacks, explored the scientist's life prior to his crippling injury, which is attributed to a Thal nuclear attack (an idea that first appeared in [[Terrance Dicks]]' novelisation of ''Genesis of the Daleks'').\n\n''Davros'', which does not feature the Daleks, apparently fills in the gaps between ''Resurrection of the Daleks'' and ''Revelation of the Daleks'',<ref>A timeline provided with ''The Complete Davros Collection'' placed ''Davros'' after ''Resurrection of the Daleks''.</ref> and has the scientist trying to manipulate the galaxy's economy into a war footing similar to Skaro's. The Sixth Doctor manages to defeat his plans, and Davros is last heard when his ship explodes, an event obliquely mentioned in ''Revelation''. However the Doctor thinks he has survived. Davros also mentions he will work on a plan to combat famine, tying into Revelation of the Daleks.\n\n''[[The Davros Mission]]'' is an original audio adventure (without the Doctor) available on the Complete Davros Collection DVD box set.  It takes place directly after the television story ''Revelation'', while leaving the planet Necros and beginning Davros' trial.  At the end of ''Davros Mission'', he turns the tables on the Daleks, forcing them to do his bidding.  The Big Finish miniseries [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#I.2C Davros|I, Davros]], also features trial scenes, but mostly explores his early life. In those four stories, his journey is seen from his boyhood, to just before ''Genesis of the Daleks''.\n\n''[[The Curse of Davros]]'' begins with Davros and the Daleks working together to try and alter the outcome of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] using technology that Davros has created that allows him to swap peoples' minds, with matters becoming more complicated when the [[Sixth Doctor]] uses the device to swap bodies with Davros in an attempt to subvert the Daleks' plans from the inside. At the end, Davros and the Doctor are returned to their original bodies with the aid of the Doctor's new companion Flip Jackson, and Davros is left with an army of Daleks who have had their minds wiped. These Daleks presumably become the \"Imperial Daleks\", first seen in ''Remembrance of the Daleks''.\n\nIn ''[[The Juggernauts]]'', Davros is on the run from the original Daleks.  He hatches a plan to add human [[Nervous system|tissue]] to robotic [[List of Doctor Who robots#M|Mechanoids]], using them, along with his own Daleks, to destroy the originals.  At the end of the story, the [[self-destruct]] mechanism of Davros' life-support chair explodes, destroying an entire human colony. It is not clear how Davros survives to become the Dalek Emperor as seen in ''Remembrance''. However, in the DVD, the Davros Connections, director Gary Russell points out that the explosion of Davros' life-support chair leaves the listener to believe there is little of Davros left. This fits chronologically the fact that in \"Remembrance\" Davros is seen as a head inside the Emperor Dalek.<ref>[http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/DavrosBoxset.htm The Davros Connections DVD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208152946/http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/DavrosBoxset.htm |date=8 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Daleks Among Us]]'', Davros returns to Azimuth, a planet that was invaded by the Daleks long ago, presenting himself as a victim of Dalek enslavement to infiltrate an underground movement against the repressive government- so desperate to prevent riots about individual actions during the Dalek occupation that official policy is now that the Dalek invasion never happened- seeking the remnants of an old experiment he carried out on the planet. This experiment is revealed to be Falkus, a clone of Davros's original body that was intended to be a new host for his mind, with Falkus having evolved an independent personality since the Daleks left Azimuth. Falkus attempts to acquire the Persuasion Machine, a dangerous device that the [[Seventh Doctor]] has been tracking with his companions [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Klein|Elizabeth Klein]] and [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Will Arrowsmith|Will Arrowsmith]], but the Doctor is able to trick Falkus into using the reprogrammed Persuasion Machine to destroy himself and his Daleks, while Davros flees in an escape pod. Davros is last shown trapped on the planet Lamuria, faced with the spectral former residents of the planet who sought to punish all criminals in the universe. \n\nBy the time of the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio play ''[[Terror Firma]]'' (set after ''Remembrance''), Davros is commanding a Dalek army which has successfully conquered the Earth. His mental instability has grown to the point where \"Davros\" and \"the Emperor\" exist within him as [[Disassociative identity disorder|different personalities]]. His Daleks recognise this instability and rebel against Davros. By the story's end the Emperor personality is dominant, and the Daleks agree to follow him and leave Earth.\n\n===Novels===\n''Terror Firma'' may contradict{{or|date=January 2018}} the events of the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], in which an unmerged Davros is placed on trial by the Dalek Prime, a combination of the Dalek Emperor and the [[Dalek variants#Dalek Supreme|Dalek Supreme]]. In the novel the Dalek Prime claimed that the planet Antalin had been [[Terraforming|terraformed]] to resemble Skaro and was destroyed in its place.  A subterfuge to destroy Daleks aligned to Davros; both on Skaro (Antalin) and those that remained hidden within Dalek ranks on Skaro (original).  Despite finding evidence of threat to Skaro via evidence found on 22nd century earth of Davros' mission to 1960s Earth and seeing the event via time-tracking equipment, the Dalek Prime allowed the destruction of Skaro to destroy Daleks allied to Davros. Dalek Prime also claimed that the Dalek/Movellan war (and indeed most of Dalek history before the destruction of \"Skaro\") was actually faked for Davros' benefit; in fact another ruse designed to bait Davros into giving evidence against himself (as he does in his trial.) Skaro is later seen to be intact and undamaged, and one character notes that it is quite possible the Dalek Prime is lying in order to weaken Davros' claim to leadership of the Daleks, while using foreknowledge of events to destroy and entrap Davros and his allies.\n\n''War of the Daleks'', like the comic strips and audio plays, is of uncertain [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] when it comes to the television series. At the conclusion of ''War'', Davros was seemingly disintegrated by a [[Dalek variants#Spider Daleks|Spider Dalek]] on the order of the Dalek Prime. However, Davros had previously recruited one of the Spider Daleks as a [[sleeper agent]] for just such an eventuality, and even he was not certain in the end if he was being disintegrated or being [[Teleportation|teleported]] away to safety, leaving the possibility open for his return.\n\n===Short fiction===\n[[Paul Cornell]]'s dark vignette in the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' Brief Encounters series, \"An Incident Concerning the Bombardment of the Phobos Colony\" occurs sometime between \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" and his assumption of the role of Emperor.\n\n===Theatre===\nIn 1993, Michael Wisher, the original Davros, with [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]], who had played his confederate, Nyder, reprised the role in an unlicensed one-off amateur stage production, ''[[The Trial of Davros]]''.

With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like, [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". Later in the programme's run, the Daleks acquired [[time travel in fiction|time travel technology]] and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across all of history. \n\nThey are the show's most popular villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention and their frequent order to \"Exterminate!\" has become common usage.\n\n==Creation==\nThe Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] and designed by [[BBC]] designer [[Raymond Cusick]].<ref name=Cusick>{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Asa |authorlink=Asa Briggs |title=The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom |year=1995 |volume=vol. 5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0pRGjVGtUvwC&lpg=PP1&dq=isbn%3A019215964X&pg=PA422#v=onepage&q= |accessdate=20 March 2010 |isbn=0-19-215964-X }}<br/>Designer Raymond Cusick said that he got the idea of their appearance \"whilst fiddling with a pepperpot\" and had them produced in fibreglass, at a cost of under &pound;250 each.</ref> They were introduced in December 1963 in the second ''Doctor Who'' serial, colloquially known as ''[[The Daleks]]''.<ref name=B2>{{cite episode\n | title = The Survivors\n | episodelink =\n | series = Doctor Who\n | serieslink = Doctor Who\n | credits = Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[Christopher Barry]], Producer [[Verity Lambert]]\n | network = BBC\n | location = London\n | airdate = 28 December 1963\n}}</ref> They became an immediate and huge hit with viewers, featuring in many subsequent serials and two 1960s motion pictures.

The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section, and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.<ref name=\"Monsters-82\"/>\n\nIn addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director's commands or studio dialogue. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: \"You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone, and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by voice actors [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who would vary the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. Although the exact sound-processing devices used have varied, the original 1963 effect used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which director [[Graeme Harper]] deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

One faction, the \"Imperial Daleks\", were loyal to Davros, who had become their Emperor, whilst the other, the \"Renegade Daleks\", followed a black Supreme Dalek. By the end of the story, both factions have been wiped out and the Doctor has tricked them into destroying Skaro, though Davros escapes.<ref name=Remembrance/>\n\nA single Dalek appeared in \"[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]\", written by [[Rob Shearman|Robert Shearman]], which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] which had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> A [[Emperor Dalek|Dalek Emperor]] returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects.

These Daleks and their fleet were destroyed in \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\".<ref name=Parting/> The 2006 season finale \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\"/\"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\" featured a squad of four Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the [[Cult of Skaro]], led by a black Dalek known as \"[[Dalek Sec|Sec]]\", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the [[The Void (Doctor Who)|Void]] between dimensions. They emerged, along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[Cyberman#Revived series|Cybermen from a parallel world]]. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the [[Tenth Doctor]] caused both groups to be sucked back into the Void.

To this end, Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid.

This angers the rest of the Cult, resulting in mutiny and the death of Sec, Thay and Jast as well as the wiping out of all the hybrids. This leaves Dalek Caan as the last Dalek in existence. When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.<ref name=Evolution/>\n\nThe Daleks returned in the 2008 season's two-part finale, \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\"/\"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in \"The Vault\", a section of the Dalek flagship, the ''Crucible''. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a \"reality bomb\" for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of [[Donna Noble]], a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.<ref name=Stolen>{{cite episode | title = [[The Stolen Earth]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 28 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=Journey>{{cite episode | title = [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 5 July 2008}}</ref> The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode \"[[Victory of the Daleks]]\", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the \"Progenitor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |publisher=BBC | title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator | last=McKinstry | first=Peter}}</ref> This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA.

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels.

The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called \"Dr. Who\" who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called \"the TARDIS\".<ref>Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129</ref>\n\nFour books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s. ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|The Dalek Book]]'' (1964, written by Terry Nation and [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]]), ''The Dalek World'' (1965, written by Nation and Whitaker) and ''The Dalek Outer Space Book'' (1966, by Nation and Brad Ashton) were all hardcover books formatted like [[annual publication#British annuals|annuals]], containing text stories and comics about the Daleks, along with fictional information (sometimes based on the television serials, other times made up for the books).<ref>Howe (1992), p. 138</ref> Nation also published ''The Dalek Pocketbook and Space-Travellers Guide'', which collected articles and features treating the Daleks as if they were real.<ref>Howe (2003), pp.126\u2013127</ref> Four more annuals were published in the 1970s by World Distributors under the title ''Terry Nation's Dalek Annual'' (with cover dates 1976\u20131979, but published 1975\u20131978).<ref>Howe (1992), pp. 74\u201375</ref>  Two original novels by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997) and ''[[Legacy of the Daleks]]'' (1998), were released as part of the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series of ''Doctor Who'' novels.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[War of the Daleks]] |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1997 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40573-2}}<br/>{{cite book |title=[[Legacy of the Daleks]] |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1998 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40574-0}}<br/>Howe (2003), pp. 83\u201384</ref>  A novella, ''[[The Dalek Factor]]'' by [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]], was published in 2004, and two books featuring the Daleks and the [[Tenth Doctor]] (''[[I am a Dalek]]'' by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], 2006, and ''[[Prisoner of the Daleks]]'' by [[Trevor Baxendale]], 2009) have been released as part of the [[New Series Adventures]].<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Dalek Factor]] |last=Clark |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Clark (novelist) |year=2004 |publisher=[[Telos Publishing]] |location=[[Tolworth]], Surrey |isbn=1-903889-30-8}}<br/>{{cite book |title=[[I am a Dalek]] |last=Roberts |first=Gareth |authorlink=Gareth Roberts (writer) |year=2006 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=1-84607-641-2}}<br/>{{cite book |title=[[Prisoner of the Daleks]] |last=Baxendale |first=Trevor |authorlink=Trevor Baxendale |year=2009 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-48648-1}}<br/>Howe (2006), p. 51</ref>\n\nNation authorised the publication of the comic strip ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#TV Century 21|The Daleks]]'' in the comic ''[[TV Century 21]]'' in 1965. The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |publisher=Doctor Who Reference Guide}}</ref>\n\nOther licensed appearances have included a number of stage plays (see [[#Stage plays|Stage plays]] below) and television adverts for [[Wall's ice cream|Wall's]] \"Sky Ray\" ice lollies (1966), [[Weetabix]] breakfast cereal (1977), [[Kit Kat]] chocolate bars (2001),<ref name=bignell187 >{{cite book |title=Terry Nation |last1=Bignell |first1=Jonathan |last2=O'Day |first2=Andrew |year=2004 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=[[Manchester]] |page=187 |isbn=0-7190-6547-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=grv8uA0MtXkC |accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref><ref>Newman, pp. 35, 120\u2013121</ref> and the [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ Bank]] (2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anz.com/about-us/our-company/profile/advertising/ |title=Advertising |publisher=[[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ Bank]] |accessdate=7 January 2010}}<br/>\n{{cite web |url=http://afcorson.site.net.au/ |title=The Daleks |accessdate=7 January 2010 |format=[[SWF]] format;

Based on this game is a ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' style role-playing game called ''Freedroid RPG'' where several Dalek-like robots appear. The base version is called ''Dalex'', its powerful, but slow weapon, the ''Exterminator'', is also available to the player.\n\nThe Daleks also appear in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' where they ally themselves with Lord Vortech and possess the size-altering scale keystone. When Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle encounter them, they assume that they are allies of the Doctor and attack the trio. The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until they call the Doctor to save them. A Dalek saucer also appears in the level based on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], in which the top of it serves as the stage for the boss battle against [[Sauron]] and includes Daleks among the various enemies summoned to attack the player. A Dalek is also among the elements summoned by the player to deal with the obstacles in the ''[[Portal 2]]'' story level.\n\n===Full-size reproductions===\nDalek fans have been building life-size reproduction Daleks for many years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalekcity.co.uk/ |title=The DBG History |last=Dando |first=Mark |year=2005 |work=Dalek Builders' Guild |accessdate=9 March 2010}}<br/>{{cite web |url=http://www.projectdalek.co.uk/files/dalek_showcase.html |title=Dalek Showcase |work=Project Dalek |accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> The BBC and Terry Nation estate officially disapprove of self-built Daleks, but usually intervene only if attempts are made to trade unlicensed Daleks and Dalek components commercially, or if it is considered that actual or intended use may damage the BBC's reputation or the Doctor Who/Dalek brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daleklinks.co.uk/about/fan-built-daleks |title=The BBC's position on fan-built Daleks |last=Labrow |first=Peter |year=2010 |work=Dalek Links |accessdate=9 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914131540/http://www.daleklinks.co.uk/about/fan-built-daleks |archivedate=14 September 2009 }}</ref> The [[Crewe]], Cheshire-based company \"This Planet Earth\" is the only business which has been licensed by the BBC and the Terry Nation Estate to produce full-size TV Dalek replicas, and by [[StudioCanal|Canal+ Image UK Ltd.]] to produce full size Movie Dalek replicas commercially.<ref name=\"lesbian\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/28/dalek_film/ |title=BBC pulls plug on Dalek lesbian romp flick |last=Haines |first=Lester |year=2005 |accessdate=24 March 2010 |work=[[The Register]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisplanetearth.co.uk/main/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428070501/http://www.thisplanetearth.co.uk/main/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 April 2009 |title=Home |year=2010 |work=This Planet Earth |accessdate=9 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Doctor Who|BBC}}\n* [[History of the Daleks]]\n* [[Dalek variants]]\n* [[Dalekmania]]\n* [[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n*{{cite book |last=Haining |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Haining (author)|year=1988 |title=Doctor Who: 25 Glorious Years |publisher=[[W.

In [[Peter Tork]]'s commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.\n\n[[File:The Monkees May 1967.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Early photo of the Monkees]]\n\nThe NBC television series the Monkees was popular, and remained in syndication. After the group disbanded in 1971, Jones reunited with [[Micky Dolenz]] as well as Monkees songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]] in 1974 as a short-lived group called [[Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart]].<ref name=lefco/>\n\nA Monkees television show marathon (\"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\") broadcast on 23 February 1986 by MTV resulted in a wave of Monkeemania not seen since the group's heyday. Jones reunited with Dolenz and [[Peter Tork]] from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band's renewed success and promote the 20th anniversary of the group. A new top 20 hit, \"That Was Then, This Is Now\" was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, ''[[Pool It!]]''.<ref name=lefco/>\n\nMonkees activity ceased until 1996 when Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and [[Michael Nesmith]] to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band. The group released a new album entitled ''[[Justus (album)|Justus]]'', the first album since 1967's ''[[Headquarters (album)|Headquarters]]'' that featured the band members performing all instrumental duties. It was the last time all four Monkees performed together.<ref name=lefco/>\n\nIn February 2011, Jones confirmed rumours of another Monkees reunion. \"There's even talk of putting the Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour,\" he told Disney's Backstage Pass newsletter. \"You're always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/myVacation/newsletter/download?id=BackstagePassS1NFPage&module=S1NF201102Article&CMP=NLC-WDWFY11Q2Feb2011WDWDomEnews0030 |title=Disney's Backstage Pass Feb. 2001 |publisher=Disneyworld.disney.go.com |accessdate=2 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The tour (Jones's last) came to fruition entitled, ''[[An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour]].''<ref>{{cite news |title=Monkees announce 10-date concert tour |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2011/02/21/Monkees-announce-10-date-concert-tour/UPI-30601298316685/ |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nJones is the next closest member of the Monkees (to Micky Dolenz) who had worked with the band since its inception.

The store sold \"hip\" clothing and accessories and also allowed customers to design their own clothes.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAfter the Monkees officially disbanded in 1971, Jones kept himself busy by establishing a New York City-style street market in Los Angeles, called \"The Street\" which cost approximately $40,000.<ref name=baker/> He also collaborated with musical director Doug Trevor on a one-hour ABC television special entitled ''Pop Goes Davy Jones'', which featured new artists [[The Jackson 5]] and [[the Osmonds]].<ref name=baker/>\n\n[[Bell Records]], then having a string of hits with ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', signed Jones to a somewhat inflexible solo record contract in 1971.<ref name=baker/> Jones was not allowed to choose his songs or producer, resulting in several lacklustre and aimless records.<ref name=baker/> His second solo album, ''[[Davy Jones (album)|Davy Jones]]'' (1971) was notable for the song \"Rainy Jane\", which reached No.52 in the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. To promote the album, Jones performed \"[[Girl (Davy Jones song)|Girl]]\" on an episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' entitled \"[[List of The Brady Bunch episodes|Getting Davy Jones]]\".<ref name=baker/> Although the single sold poorly, the popularity of Jones's appearance on the show resulted in \"Girl\" becoming his best-remembered solo hit, even though it was not included in the album. The final single, \"I'll Believe In You\"/\"Road to Love,\" was poorly received.<ref name=baker/>\n\n==Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart==\n\nThanks in part to reruns of The Monkees on Saturday mornings and in syndication, ''[[The Monkees Greatest Hits]]'' charted in 1976. The LP, issued by Arista (a subsidiary of Screen Gems), was actually a repackaging of a 1972 compilation LP called ''Refocus'' that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, [[Bell Records]], also owned by Screen Gems.\n\nDolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]] to tour the United States. From 1975 to 1977, as the \"Golden Hits of The Monkees\" show (\"The Guys who Wrote 'Em and the Guys who Sang 'Em!\"), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks as well as making stops in Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, (though they couldn't use the Monkees name for legal reasons). They also released an album of new material appropriately as  [[Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart]], additionally a live album ''Concert in Japan'' was released by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in 1976).\n\n[[Mike Nesmith]] had not been interested in a reunion (due largely to his dislike of touring). [[Peter Tork]] claimed later that he had not been asked, which agreed with what one of the CD booklets stated that they simply didn't know where he was at that time. Although a Christmas single (credited to Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Peter Tork) was produced by former Monkee producer [[Chip Douglas]] and released on his own label in 1976. The single featured Douglas's and Howard Kaylan's \"[[Christmas Is My Time of Year]]\" (originally recorded by a 1960s supergroup, Christmas Spirit), with a B-side of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" (Douglas released a remixed version of the single, with additional overdubbed instruments, in 1986). Tork also joined Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart on stage at Disneyland on 4 July 1976, and also joined Dolenz and Jones on stage at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, in 1977.\n\n==Further stage and screen appearances==\n\n[[File:Davy Jones Maureen McCormick Brady Bunch 1971.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Jones with [[Maureen McCormick]] in the 1971 ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' episode \"Getting Davy Jones\", in which he was a guest star]]\n\nJones also continued acting after the Monkees, either as himself or another character.\n\nHe returned to theatre several times after the Monkees. 1977 saw him performing with former band-mate [[Micky Dolenz]] in a stage production of the [[Harry Nilsson]] musical ''[[The Point!]]'' in London at the Mermaid Theatre, playing and singing the starring role of \"Oblio\" to Dolenz' roles as the \"Count's Kid\" and the \"Leafman\", (according to the CD booklet). An original cast recording was made and released. The comedic chemistry of Jones and Dolenz proved so strong that the show was revived in 1978 with Nilsson inserting additional comedy for the two, plus two more songs, with one of them (\"Gotta Get Up\") being sung by Jones and Dolenz. The show was considered so good that it was planned to be revived again in 1979 but it proved cost prohibitive (source CD booklet \"Harry Nilsson's The Point\").<ref name=baker/> Jones also appeared in several productions of ''[[Oliver!]]'' as the Artful Dodger, and in 1989 toured the US portraying \"Fagin\".\n\nHe appeared in two episodes each of ''[[Love, American Style]]'' and ''[[My Two Dads]]''.<ref name=baker/> Jones also appeared in animated form as himself in 1972 in an hour-long episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.<ref name=baker/> Other television appearances include ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'', ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Single Guy]]'' (where he is mistaken for [[Dudley Moore]]) and ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' in which he sang \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" to Sabrina ([[Melissa Joan Hart]]) as well as (I'll) Love You Forever.<ref name=lefco/>\n\nMuch more intriguingly, in 1995 Jones played in a notable episode of the sitcom \"Boy Meets World\". His two former fellow [[Monkees]] [[Micky Dolenz]] and [[Peter Tork]] had already appeared separately as characters on previous episodes.  Suddenly in episode eight of the 3rd season (titled \"Rave On\"), all three former-Monkees turn up, although they did not play the Monkees per se (Davy Jones is \"Reginald Fairfield\", while Dolenz is \"Gordy\" and Tork is \"Jedidiah Lawrence\"). Much of the comedy of the show is thrown to Jones.  However at the climax of the program the three are put on stage together and perform the classic [[Buddy Holly]] song \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", and the [[Temptations]] \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\". As an inside-joke, actor [[Dave Madden]] who'd played the manager on \"[[The Partridge Family]]\" cameoed as a manager who suddenly appeared wanting to handle the \"new\" group telling them that they \"could be bigger than the [[Beatles]]\". Purportedly both ex-[[Monkee]] [[Mike Nesmith]] and [[Pattie Boyd]] ex-wife of [[Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] were in attendance at the taping. (per IMDB entry \"Boy Meets World\" episode \"Rave On\").\n\nIn 2009, Jones made a cameo appearance as himself in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One]]\" (his appearance was meant to be a pun on \"[[Davy Jones' Locker]]\").<ref name=lefco/>\n\nDespite his initial high profile after the end of the Monkees, Jones struggled to establish himself as a solo artist. [[Glenn A. Baker]], author of ''Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees'', commented in 1986 that \"for an artist as versatile and confident as (Davy) Jones, the relative failure of his post-Monkees activities is puzzling. For all his cocky predictions to the press about his future plans, Davy fell into a directionless heap when left to his own devices.\"<ref name=baker/>\n\nThe continued popularity of his 1971 ''Brady Bunch'' appearance led to his being cast as himself in ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]''. Jones sang his signature solo hit \"Girl\", with a [[grunge]] band providing backing,<ref name=lefco/> this time with middle-aged women swooning over him.<ref name=lefco/> Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork also appeared alongside Jones as judges.<ref name=lefco/>\n\n==Later recording career==\n\nOn 21 June 1997, during a concert at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], Jones joined [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]] onstage for a karaoke performance of \"[[Daydream Believer]],\" which had become a fixture of the band's set during that year's [[PopMart Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU-VF9dtWeE|title=The Edge & Davy Jones - Daydream Believer (U2 Popmart Tour, 1997)|first=|last=Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=14 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Davy Jones (Geneva, IL, 2006).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Jones at a 2006 concert in Geneva, Illinois]]\nIn 2001, Jones released ''[[Just Me (Davy Jones album)|Just Me]]'', an album of his own songs, some written for the album and others originally on Monkees releases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Aaron Badgley |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/just-me-mw0001230763 |title=Just Me - Davy Jones &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref> In the early 2000s he was performing in the Flower Power Concert Series during [[Epcot]]'s Flower and Garden Festival, a yearly gig he would continue until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeesrule43.com/myexperiences_davy_epcot02.html |title=Davy Jones Solo \u2013 April 19, 2002 \u2013 EPCOT's Flower Power Festival |publisher=Monkeesrule43.com |date=19 April 2002 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/guides/epcot/events/ep-flower-garden.htm |title=2014 Epcot Flower and Garden Festival, Flower Garden Epcot |publisher=Wdwinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2006, Jones recorded the single \"Your Personal Penguin\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/songs/boynton/YourPersonalPenguin.mp3 |title=MP3 of the song Personal Penguin |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> written by children's author [[Sandra Boynton]], as a companion piece to her new board book of the same title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/ |title=Workman Publishing author site for Sandra Boynton |publisher=Workman.com |accessdate=2 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121224759/http://www.workman.com/boynton/ |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df= }}</ref> On 1 November 2007, the Boynton book and CD titled ''Blue Moo'' was released and Jones is featured in both the book and CD, singing \"Your Personal Penguin\".

She played the protagonist's girlfriend in ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'', co-starred in Wood's ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'', and had a minor role in his ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. Later, [[Elvis Presley]] recorded a number of her songs written for his films.\n\n==Film career==\nHer first screen appearance was at the age of 10, when she appeared briefly in [[Frank Capra]]\u2019s ''[[It Happened One Night]]''. According to Fuller,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/147880%7C0/Bride-of-the-Monster.html |title=Bride of the Monster |last=Miller |first=John M. |date= |website=Turner Classic Movies |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2017 |quote=}}</ref> the female lead in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' was written for her but Wood gave it to [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]] instead.\n\nIn August 1954, Fuller was cast in Wood's ''The Vampire's Tomb'', intended to star [[Bela Lugosi]]. Frank Yaconelli was named as her co-star and 'comic killer'. The film was never made. She ended up making an appearance in ''Bride of the Monster'' (1956), also with Lugosi.<ref>\"Vampire Types Gathering For Movie\" (August 2, 1954) ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', p. B9</ref> Fuller hosted a benefit for Lugosi which preceded the showing of ''Bride of the Atom'' (early working title of ''Bride of the Monster'') on May 11, 1955. A cocktail party was held at the Gardens Restaurant at 4311 Magnolia Avenue in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California. [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]] attended and was escorted by [[Paul Marco]]. A single screening of the film was presented at the Hollywood Paramount.<ref>\"Lugosi Benefit Slated Tonight\" (May 11, 1955) ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', p. 27</ref>\n\nAccording to Fuller, as quoted in Wood biography ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'' (1992), she first met Ed Wood when she attended a casting call with a friend for a movie he was supposed to direct called ''Behind Locked Doors''; it has also been stated that they met in a restaurant.<ref name=telegraph-obit/>\n\nShe became his girlfriend shortly thereafter and began acting in his films. Her movie career included a bit part in ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) and roles in ''Outlaw Women'' (1952), ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (1953), ''Body Beautiful'' (1953), ''[[The Blue Gardenia]]'' (1953), ''[[Count the Hours]]'' (1953), ''[[Mesa of Lost Women]]'' (1953), ''College Capers'' (1954), ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'' (1954), ''[[The Raid (1954 film)|The Raid]]'' (1954), ''This Is My Love'' (1954), ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (1956), ''The Ironbound Vampire'' (1997), and ''Dimensions in Fear'' (1998).\n\n==Television performer and songwriter==\nFuller had already had earlier experience on television in ''[[Queen for a Day]]'' and ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]''. As Fuller remembered, she was the one \"putting bread on the table.\" Another quote from her: \"I had a size four and a half foot, so I modeled the slippers in an artist's short smock.\"{{cq}}\n\nShe lost her job on ''The Dinah Shore Show'' when, as she said, \"We were shooting all night, and into the next day, and time just got away from me, and I didn't realize that I was supposed to be on the set working as Dinah's double on her show, Chevy Theatre. I completely messed up my job, I was what they called a no show.\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2010}} She also appeared on an episode of ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]'' as \"the blonde in the mink coat.\"\n\nFuller's ability as a songwriter manifested itself through the intervention of her friend, producer [[Hal B. Wallis|Hal Wallis]]; Fuller had wanted to get an acting role in the Elvis Presley movie ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', which Wallis was producing, but instead he put her in touch with [[Hill & Range]], the publisher that provided Presley with songs. Fuller went into a collaborative partnership with composer [[Ben Weisman]] and co-wrote one song, \"[[Rock-A-Hula Baby]]\", for the film. It was a beginning that eventually led to Elvis Presley recording a dozen of her songs, including \"I Got Lucky\" and \"Spinout\". Fuller also had her music recorded by [[Nat 'King' Cole]], [[Peggy Lee]], and other leading talents of the time. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Private life==\nGrey quotes Fuller as saying of the period before her success, \"He (Ed Wood) begged me to marry him. I loved him in a way, but I couldn't handle the transvestism. I'm a very normal person. It's hard for me to deviate! I wanted a man that was all man. After we broke up, he would stand outside my home in Burbank and cry. 'Let me in, I love you!' What good would I have done if I had married him? We would have starved together. I bettered myself. I had to uplift myself.\"<ref>Rudolph Grey (1992) ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D.

The fort was built to control the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.<ref name=\"Forts\">{{cite book|last=Schoen|first=Christopher M. |author2=W.E.

Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\n<blockquote>This is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old [[dragoon]] houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are.

Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] to reach a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside.

The former [[Public Library of Des Moines|Des Moines Public Library building]] (now the home of the [[World Food Prize]]); the United States [[U.S. Post Office (Des Moines, Iowa)|central Post Office]], built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the [[Des Moines City Hall|City Hall]] are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the [[Civic Center Historic District (Des Moines, Iowa)|Civic Center Historic District]].\n\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the mid-1930s, during the [[Great Depression]] under Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s.<ref>Dahl, Orin L.

Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\nThis form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a [[council-manager]] government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from [[single-member district]]s or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009.<ref name=\"citypop\">{{cite web|publisher=United States Census Bureau|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places in Iowa: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls|format=XLS|accessdate=June 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628184052/http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls|archivedate=June 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\n\nDuring the [[Great Flood of 1993]], heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels.

The 25-story [[Financial Center]] was completed in 1973 and the 36-story [[Ruan Center]] was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story [[Des Moines Marriott Hotel]] (1981), the 25-story [[HUB Tower]] and 25-story [[Plaza Building (Des Moines, Iowa)|Plaza Building]] (1985). Iowa's tallest building, [[Principal Financial Group]]'s 45-story tower at [[801 Grand]] was built in 1991, and the 19-story [[EMC Insurance Building]] was erected in 1997.\n\nDuring this time period, the [[Civic Center of Greater Des Moines]] (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events.

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] he volunteered for the [[Royal Air Force]], but was unable to serve because of a case of childhood rheumatic fever. He joined Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd in [[West Thurrock]], where he became a maintenance engineer. Subsequently, he was a shareholder in a small engineering company called Kine engineering, producing machine tools. Following his father's death on New Year's Eve, 31 December 1948 and aided by Malcolm's chief engineer, [[Leo Villa]], the younger Campbell strove to set speed records first on [[Water speed record|water]] and then [[Land Speed Record|land]].\n\nHe married three times: to Daphne Harvey in 1945, producing daughter Georgina (Gina) Campbell, born on 19 September 1946; to Dorothy McKegg in 1952; and to Tonia Bern in December 1958, which lasted until his death in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racingcampbells.com/content/donald.asp |title=Donald & Malcolm Campbell - Donald |publisher=The Racing Campbells |date= |accessdate=26 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003155431/http://www.racingcampbells.com/content/donald.asp |archivedate=3 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Campbell was intensely superstitious, hating the colour green, the number thirteen and believing nothing good ever happened on a Friday.

Campbell was a great [[patriotism|patriot]] and saw his achievements as being for the greater good of Britain.<ref name=\"tremayne\">Donald Campbell: The Man Behind The Mask, David Tremayne, Bantam Press, London, 2004.</ref>\n\n==Water speed records==\n\n[[File:Bluebird K7 in 1960 at Goodwood.jpg|thumb|left| Bluebird K7 on display at Goodwood Motor Racing circuit in 1960.]]\n\nCampbell began his speed record attempts in the summer of 1949, using his father's old boat, ''[[Blue Bird K4]]'', which he renamed Bluebird K4. His initial attempts that summer were unsuccessful, although he did come close to raising his father's existing record. The team returned to [[Coniston Water]], [[Furness|Lancashire]]<!--Do not change to Cumbria, it did not exist prior to 1974--> in 1950 for further trials. While there, they heard that an American, [[Stanley Sayres]], had raised the record from {{convert|141|to|160|mph|abbr=on}}, beyond K4's capabilities without substantial modification.\n\nOver the winter of 1950 to 1951, Bluebird K4 was modified to make it a 'prop-rider' as opposed to her original immersed propeller configuration. This greatly reduced hydrodynamic drag as the third planing point would now be the propeller hub, meaning one of the two propeller blades was always out of the water at high speed. She now sported two cockpits, the second one being for Leo Villa.\n\nBluebird K4 now had a chance of exceeding Sayers' record and also enjoyed success as a circuit racer, winning the Oltranza Cup in [[Italy]] in the spring of that year. Returning to Coniston in September, they finally got Bluebird up to 170&nbsp;mph after further trials, only to suffer a structural failure at {{convert|170|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} which wrecked the boat. Sayers raised the record the following year to {{convert|178|mph|abbr=on}} in Slo-Mo-Shun IV.\n\nAlong with Campbell, Britain had another potential contender for Water Speed Record honours - [[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]]. He had commissioned the world's first purpose-built turbojet [[Hydroplane (boat)|Hydroplane]], ''[[Crusader (speedboat)|Crusader]]'', with a target speed of over {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}, and began trials on [[Loch Ness]] in autumn 1952. Cobb was killed later that year, when Crusader broke up, during an attempt on the record. Campbell was devastated at Cobb's loss, but he resolved to build a new Bluebird boat to bring the WSR back to Britain.\n\nIn early 1953, Campbell began development of his own advanced all-metal jet-powered ''[[Bluebird K7]]'' hydroplane to challenge the record, by now held by the American prop rider hydroplane Slo-Mo-Shun IV.[1] Designed by Ken and Lew Norris, the K7 was a steel framed, aluminium bodied, three-point hydroplane with a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl axial-flow turbojet engine, producing 3,500 pound-force (16&nbsp;kN) of thrust.\n\nLike Slo-Mo-Shun, but unlike Cobb's tricycle Crusader, the three planing points were arranged with two forward, on outrigged sponsons and one aft, in a \"pickle-fork\" layout, prompting Bluebird's early comparison to a blue lobster. K7 was of very advanced design and construction, and its load bearing steel space frame ultra rigid and stressed to 25g (exceeding contemporary military jet aircraft). It had a design speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=off}} and remained the only successful jet-boat in the world until the late 1960s.\n\nThe designation \"K7\" was derived from its Lloyd's unlimited rating registration. It was carried on a prominent white roundel on each sponson, underneath an infinity symbol. Bluebird K7 was the seventh boat registered at Lloyds in the 'Unlimited' series.\n\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between July 1955 and December 1964. The first of these marks was set at [[Ullswater]] on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of {{convert|202.32|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} but only after many months of trials and a major redesign of Bluebird's forward sponson attachments points. Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of {{convert|216|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada. Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the latter half of the '50s, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then subsequently BP.\n\nCampbell also made an attempt in 1957 at [[Canandaigua]] in [[New York state]] in the summer of 1957, which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions. Bluebird K7 became a well known and popular attraction, and as well as her annual Coniston appearances, K7 was displayed extensively in the UK, USA, Canada and Europe, and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell's prolonged attempt on the land speed record (LSR) in 1963-64.\n\nIn order to extract more speed, and endow the boat with greater high speed stability, in both pitch and yaw, K7 was subtly modified in the second half of the 1950s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull. In 1958, a small wedge shaped tail fin, housing an arrester parachute, modified sponson fairings, that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift, and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin, attached to the transom to aid directional stability, and exert a marginal down-force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane. Thus she reached {{convert|225|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1956, where an unprecedented peak speed of {{convert|286.78|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was achieved on one run, {{convert|239|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1957, {{convert|248|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1958 and {{convert|260|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1959.\n\nCampbell was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in January 1957 for his water speed record breaking, and in particular his record at [[Lake Mead]] in the USA which earned him and Britain very positive acclaim.\n\n==Land speed record attempt==\n[[File:1962 Bluebird Campbell CN7.JPG|thumb|left|''Bluebird CN7'' on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu|National Motor Museum]] in Beaulieu.]]\n\nIt was after the Lake Mead WSR success in 1955 that the seeds of Campbell's ambition to hold the [[Land Speed Record]] as well were planted. The following year, the serious planning was under way - to build a car to break the land speed record, which then stood at {{convert|394|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} set by John Cobb in 1947. The Norris brothers designed ''[[Bluebird-Proteus CN7]]'' with {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} in mind.\n\nThe brothers were even more enthusiastic about the car than the boat and like all of his projects, Campbell wanted Bluebird CN7, to be the best of its type, a showcase of British engineering skills. The British motor industry in the guise of [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], [[BP]], [[Smiths Industries]] and [[Lucas Automotive]],Rubery Owen as well as many others, became heavily involved in the project to build the most advanced car the world had yet seen. CN7 was powered by a specially modified [[Bristol Proteus|Bristol-Siddeley Proteus]] [[Free-turbine turboshaft|free-turbine]] engine of {{convert|4450|shp|abbr=on}} driving all four wheels. Bluebird CN7 was designed to achieve 475\u2013500&nbsp;mph and was completed by the spring of 1960.\n\nFollowing low-speed tests conducted at the [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] motor racing circuit in [[Sussex]], in July, the ''CN7'' was taken to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Utah, USA, scene of his father's last LSR triumph, some 25 years earlier in September 1935. The trials initially went well, and various adjustments were made to the car. On the sixth run in CN7, Campbell lost control at over 360&nbsp;mph and crashed. It was the car's tremendous structural integrity that saved his life. He was hospitalised with a fractured skull and a burst eardrum, as well as minor cuts and bruises but ''CN7'' was a write off. Almost immediately, Campbell announced he was determined to have another go. Sir [[Alfred Owen]], whose [[Rubery Owen]] industrial group had built CN7, offered to rebuild it for him. That single decision was to have a profound influence on the rest of Campbell's life. His original plan had been to break the LSR at over 400&nbsp;mph in 1960, return to Bonneville the following year to really bump up the speed to something near to 500&nbsp;mph, get his seventh WSR with K7 and then retire, as undisputed champion of speed and perhaps just as important, secure in the knowledge that he was worthy of his father's legacy.\n\nCampbell decided not to go back to Utah for the new trials. He felt the Bonneville course was too short at {{convert|11|mi|adj=on}} and the salt surface was in poor condition. BP offered to find another venue and eventually after a long search, [[Lake Eyre]], in South Australia, was chosen. It hadn't rained there for nine years and the vast dry bed of the salt lake offered a course of up to {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}}. By the summer of 1962, Bluebird CN7 was rebuilt, some nine months later than Campbell had hoped. It was essentially the same car, but with the addition of a large stabilising tail fin and a reinforced fibreglass cockpit cover. At the end of 1962, CN7 was shipped out to Australia ready for the new attempt. Low-speed runs had just started when the rains came. The course was compromised and further rain meant, that by May 1963, Lake Eyre was flooded to a depth of 3 inches, causing the attempt to be abandoned. Campbell was heavily criticised in the press for alleged time wasting and mismanagement of the project, despite the fact that he could hardly be held responsible for the unprecedented weather.\n\nTo make matters worse for Campbell, American [[Craig Breedlove]] drove his pure thrust jet car '[[Spirit of America (automobile)|Spirit of America]]' to a speed of {{convert|407.45|mph}} at Bonneville in July 1963. Although the 'car' did not conform to [[FIA]] (Federation Internationale de L'Automobile) regulations, that stipulated it had to be wheel-driven and have a minimum of four wheels, in the eyes of the world, Breedlove was now the fastest man on earth.\n\nCampbell returned to Australia in March 1964, but the Lake Eyre course failed to fulfil the early promise it had shown in 1962 and there were further spells of rain. BP pulled out as his main sponsor after a dispute, but he was able to secure backing from Australian oil company [[Ampol]].\n\nThe track never properly dried out and Campbell was forced to make the best of the conditions. Finally, in July 1964, he was able to post some speeds that approached the record. On the 17th of that month, he took advantage of a break in the weather and made two courageous runs along the shortened and still damp track, posting a new LSR of {{convert|403.10|mph|abbr=on}}. The surreal moment was captured in a number of well-known images by photographers, including Australia's Jeff Carter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/07/on-this-day-world-land-speed-record-broken|title=On this day: World Land Speed Record broken|publisher=}}</ref>\nCampbell was bitterly disappointed with the record as the vehicle had been designed for much higher speeds. ''CN7'' covered the final third of the measured mile at an average of {{convert|429|mph|abbr=on}}, peaking as it left the measured distance at over {{convert|440|mph|abbr=on}}. He resented the fact that it had all been so difficult. 'We've made it \u2013 we got the bastard at last,' was his reaction to the success. Campbell's 403.1&nbsp;mph represented the official Land Speed Record.\n\nIn 1969, after Campbell's fatal accident, his widow, Tonia Bern-Campbell negotiated a deal with Lynn Garrison, President of Craig Breedlove and Associates, that would see [[Craig Breedlove]] run Bluebird on Bonneville's Salt Flats. This concept was cancelled when the parallel Spirit of America supersonic car project failed to find support.[[File:Model of Donald Campbell Bluebird used in Breedlove promotion.png|thumb|Model of Donald Campbell Bluebird used in Breedlove promotion]]\n\n==The Double==\n\nCampbell now planned to go after the Water Speed Record one more time with Bluebird K7 - to do what he had aimed for so many years ago, during the initial planning stages of CN7 \u2013 break both records in the same year. After more delays, he finally achieved his seventh WSR at [[Lake Dumbleyung]] near [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], on the last day of 1964, at a speed of {{convert|276.33|mph|abbr=on}}. He had become the first, and so far only, person to set both land and water speed records in the same year.\n\nCampbell's LSR was short-lived, because FIA rule changes meant that pure jet cars would be eligible to set records from October 1964. Campbell's {{convert|429|mph|abbr=on}} speed on his final Lake Eyre run remained the highest speed achieved by a wheel-driven car until 2001; ''Bluebird CN7'' is now on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu|National Motor Museum]] at Beaulieu in [[Hampshire]], England, its potential only partly realised.\n\n==Rocket car plans and final water speed record attempt==\n\n===Bluebird Mach 1.1===\n[[File:Bluebird Mach 1.1 at Priors Ford.tif|thumb|left|Promotional model of Bluebird Mach 1.1 displayed outside Campbell's house in spring 1966.]] Campbell decided a massive jump in speed was called for following his successful 1964 LSR attempt in Bluebird CN7. His vision was of a supersonic rocket car with a potential maximum speed of {{convert|840|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Norris Brothers were requested to undertake a design study. Bluebird Mach 1.1 was a design for a rocket-powered supersonic land speed record car.\nCampbell chose a lucky date to hold a press conference at the Charing Cross Hotel on 7 July 1965 to announce his future record breaking plans:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text=\"...&nbsp;In terms of speed on the Earth's surface, my next logical step must be to construct a Bluebird car that can reach Mach 1.1. The Americans are already making plans for such a vehicle and it would be tragic for the world image of British technology if we did not compete in this great contest and win. The nation whose technologies are first to seize the 'faster than sound' record on land will be the nation whose industry will be seen to leapfrog into the '70s or '80s. We can have the car on the track within three years.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}}}\n\nBluebird Mach 1.1 was to be rocket-powered. Ken Norris had calculated using rocket motors would result in a vehicle with very low frontal area, greater density, and lighter weight than if he went down the jet engine route. Bluebird Mach 1.1 would also be a relatively compact and simple design. Norris specified two off-the-shelf Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engines. The 605 had been developed as a take-off assist rocket engine for military aircraft and was fuelled with kerosene, using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer. Each engine was rated at {{convert|8,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. In Bluebird Mach 1.1 application, the combined {{convert|16,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust would be equivalent of 36,000&nbsp;bhp (27,000&nbsp;kW; 36,000 PS) at {{convert|840|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Final record attempt===\n\nIn order to increase publicity for his rocket car venture, in the spring of 1966, Campbell decided to try once more for a water speed record. This time the target was {{convert|300|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Bluebird K7'' was fitted with a lighter and more powerful [[Bristol Orpheus]] engine, taken from a [[Folland Gnat]] jet aircraft, which developed {{convert|4500|lb-f}} of thrust. The modified boat was taken back to Coniston in the first week of November 1966. The trials did not go well. The weather was appalling, and ''K7'' suffered an engine failure when her air intakes collapsed and debris was drawn into the engine. By the middle of December, some high-speed runs were made, in excess of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} but still well below Campbell's existing record. Problems with ''Bluebird'''s fuel system meant that the engine could not reach full rpm, and so would not develop maximum power. Eventually, by the end of December, after further modifications to her fuel system, and the replacement of a fuel pump, the fuel starvation problem was fixed, and Campbell awaited better weather to mount an attempt.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Donald Campbell's memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque for Donald Campbell, in Coniston village]]\nOn 4 January 1967,<ref name=spkdicr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6DhWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7ugDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5871%2C1363609 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Speed king dies in crash |date=5 January 1967 |page=13 }}</ref> weather conditions were finally suitable for an attempt. Campbell commenced the first run of his last record attempt at just after 8.45 am. Bluebird moved slowly out towards the middle of the lake, where she paused briefly as Campbell lined her up. With a deafening blast of power, Campbell now applied full throttle and Bluebird began to surge forward. Clouds of spray issued from the jet-pipe, water poured over the rear spar and after a few hundred yards, at 70&nbsp;mph, Bluebird unstuck from the surface and rocketed off towards the southern end of the lake, producing her characteristic comet's tail of spray.\nShe entered the measured kilometre at 8:46. Leo Villa witnessed her passing the first marker buoy at about {{convert|285|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in perfect steady planing trim, her nose slightly down, still accelerating.\n7.525 seconds later, Keith Harrison saw her leave the measured kilometre at a speed of over {{convert|310|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The average speed for the first run was {{convert|297.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Campbell lifted his foot from the throttle about 3/10 of a second before passing the southern kilometre marker. As Bluebird left the measured kilometre, Keith Harrison and Eric Shaw in a course boat at the southern end of the measured kilo both noticed that she was very light around the bows, riding on her front stabilising fins. Her planing trim was no worse than she had exhibited when equipped with the Beryl engine, but it was markedly different from that observed by Leo Villa at the northern end of the kilometre, when she was under full acceleration. Campbell had made his usual commentary throughout the run.\n\n\nCampbell's words on his first run were, via radio intercom:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text=\"...&nbsp;I'm under way, all systems normal; brake swept up, er&nbsp;... air pressure warning light on&nbsp;...

This was not an unprecedented diversion from normal practice, as Campbell had used the advantage presented i.e. no encroachment of water disturbances on the measured kilometre by the quick turn-a-round, in many previous runs. The second run was even faster once severe tramping subsided on the run-up from Peel Island (caused by the water-brake disturbance). Once smooth water was reached some 700 metres or so from the start of the kilometre, K7 demonstrated cycles of [[ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] hovering before accelerating hard at 0.63g to a peak speed of {{convert|328|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} some 200 metres or so from the southern marker buoy. Bluebird was now experiencing bouncing episodes of the starboard sponson with increasing ferocity. At the peak speed, the most intense and long-lasting bounce precipitated a severe decelerating episode (328&nbsp;mph - 296&nbsp;mph, -1.86g) as K7 dropped back onto the water. Engine flame-out then occurred and, shorn of thrust nose-down momentum, K7 experienced a gliding episode in strong ground effect with increasing angle-of-attack, before completely leaving the water at her static stability pitch-up limit of 5.2\u00b0. Bluebird then executed an almost complete somersault (~ 320\u00b0 and slightly off-axis) before plunging into the water (port sponson marginally in advance of the starboard), approximately 230 metres from the end of the measured kilometre. The boat then cartwheeled across the water before coming to rest. The impact broke K7 forward of the air intakes (where Campbell was sitting) and the main hull sank shortly afterwards.\n\n[[Mr Whoppit]], Campbell's teddy bear mascot, was found among the floating debris and the pilot's helmet was recovered. Royal Navy divers made efforts to find and recover the body but, although the wreck of K7 was found, they called off the search, after two weeks, without locating his body. Campbell's body was finally located in 2001.\n\nCampbell's last words, during a 31-second transmission, on his final run were, via radio intercom:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text=\"...&nbsp;Full nose up &nbsp;...

These factors have since been found to be not particularly important:<ref name=sheppard>Sheppard, Neil (2011). Donald Campbell Bluebird And The Final Record Attempt. Stroud, UK: The History Press. {{ISBN|978 0 7524 5973 8}}</ref> The water brake was used well to the south of the measured distance, and only from approx. {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The area in the centre of the course where Bluebird was travelling at peak speed on her return run was flat calm, and not disturbed by the wash from the first run, which had not had time to be reflected back on the course. Campbell knew this and, as discussed previously, adopted his well-practised, 'quick turn-around' strategy.\n* Bluebird may have exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, complicated by the additional destabilising influences of loss of engine thrust. There is also evidence to point to the fact that K7's dynamic stability limit had been exceeded. The cause(s) of the engine flame-out cannot be established unequivocally. It could have been due to fuel starvation, damage to some ancillary structural element associated with engine function (following the worst bouncing episode), disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during the pitching episodes, or indeed a combination of all three. Further evidence of lost engine thrust may be seen in both cinematographic and still film recordings of the latter part of the run - as Bluebird left the water, jet exhaust from a functioning engine would have severely disturbed the water surface; no such disturbance or accompanying spray is evident. Also, close examination of such records show no evidence to the effect that the water brake was deployed.<ref name=sheppard />\n* Analysis of film footage suggests that ''Bluebird'' may have hit a duck during test runs, which may have affected the aerodynamic shape of the boat, making it harder to control at extreme speeds.<ref name=\"Gray\">{{cite web | work=The Telegraph |title=Duck may have played role in fatal Bluebird crash | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8815900/Duck-may-have-played-role-in-fatal-Bluebird-crash.html | first=Richard | last=Gray  | date=9 October 2011 | access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 1967 Campbell was posthumously awarded the [[Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct]] \"for courage and determination in attacking the world water speed record.\"<ref name=\"brave\" />\n\n==Recovery of Bluebird K7 and the body of Donald Campbell==\nThe wreckage of Campbell's craft was recovered by the Bluebird Project between October 2000, when the first sections were raised, and May 2001, when Campbell's body was recovered. The largest section comprising approximately two thirds of the centre hull was raised on 8 March 2001. The project began when diver Bill Smith was inspired to look for the wreck after hearing the [[Marillion]] song \"Out of this World\" (from the album ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]''), which was written about Campbell and ''Bluebird''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.marillion.com/news/newsitem.htm?id=4 | title= A Day in the Lakes | publisher=marillion.com | first=Steve | last=Hogarth | date=8 March 2001 | accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe recovered wreck revealed that the water brake had deployed after the accident as a result of stored accumulator pressure; Campbell would not have had time to deploy the relatively slow-moving brake as the boat flipped out of control. The boat still contained fuel in the engine fuel lines, discounting the fuel-starvation theory. The wreckage all evidenced an impact from left to right, wiping the whole front of the boat off in that direction. Campbell's lower harness mounts had failed and were found to be effectively useless. Further dives recovered various parts of K7, which had separated from the main hull when it broke up on impact.\n\nCampbell's body was finally located just over two months later and recovered from the lake on 28 May 2001, still wearing his blue nylon overalls. On the night before his death, while playing cards he had drawn the queen and the ace of spades. Reflecting upon the fact that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] had drawn the same two cards the night before she was beheaded, he told his mechanics, who were playing cards with him, that he had a fearful premonition that he was going to \u201cget the chop\u201d.<ref> \u201cDisaster on the cards for the man who diced with death\u201d, The Telegraph, 8 Mar 2001\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1325433/Disaster-on-the-cards-for-the-man-who-diced-with-death.html </ref> It was not possible to determine the cause of Campbell's death, though a consultant engineer giving evidence to the inquest said that the force of the impact could have caused him to be decapitated <ref>\"Campbell's daughter clashes over his death\", The Telegraph, 26 October 2002 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1411288/Campbells-daughter-clashes-over-his-death.html </ref>.\n\n[[File:DonaldCampbellsGravestone.jpg|thumb|right|Campbell's gravestone in Coniston]]\nCampbell was buried in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] Cemetery on 12 September 2001 after his coffin was carried down the lake, and through the measured kilometre, on a launch, one last time. A funeral service was then held at St Andrew's Church in Coniston, after an earlier, and positive DNA examination had been carried out.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1537909.stm|title=Final tribute to water speed king|date=12 September 2001|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> The funeral was attended by his widow Tonia, daughter Gina, other members of his family, members of his former team and admirers. The funeral was overshadowed in the media by coverage of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] in the [[United States]]. Campbell's sister, Jean Wales, had been against the recovery of her brother's body out of respect for his stated wish that, in the event of something going wrong, \"Skipper and boat stay together\". Jean Wales did, however, remain in daily telephone contact with project leader Bill Smith during the recovery operation in anticipation of any news of her brother's remains. When Campbell was buried in Coniston Cemetery on 12 September 2001 she did not attend the service. [[Steve Hogarth]], lead singer for Marillion, was also present at the funeral and performed the song \"Out of this World\" solo.\n\n==Legacy==\nBetween them, Donald Campbell and his father had set eleven speed records on water and ten on land.\n\nThe story of Campbell's last attempt at the [[water speed record]] on [[Coniston Water]] was told in the [[BBC]] television film ''Across the Lake'' in 1988, with [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Campbell. Nine years earlier, [[Robert Hardy]] had played Campbell's father, [[Malcolm Campbell|Sir Malcolm Campbell]], in the ''[[BBC2 Playhouse]]'' television drama \"Speed King\"; both were written by Roger Milner and produced by [[Innes Lloyd]]. In 2003, the BBC showed a documentary reconstruction of Campbell's fateful water-speed record attempt in an episode of ''Days That Shook the World''. It featured a mixture of modern reconstruction and original film footage. All of the original colour clips were taken from a film capturing the event, ''Campbell at Coniston'' by John Lomax, a local amateur filmmaker from Wallasey, England. Lomax's film won awards worldwide in the late 1960s for recording the final weeks of Campbell's life.\n\nIn 1956, he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] for the seventh episode of the new television show ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nAn [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Campbell and his father at Canbury School, Kingston Hill, Kingston upon Thames, where they lived.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/campbell-malcolm-donald|title=Campbell, Donald (1921\u20131967) & Campbell, Sir Malcolm (1885\u20131948)|publisher=English Heritage| access-date=12 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the village of Coniston, the [[Ruskin Museum]] has a display of Donald Campbell memorabilia, and the Bristol Orpheus engine recovered in 2001 is also displayed. The engine's casing is mostly missing, having acted as a sacrificial anode in its time underwater, but the internals are remarkably preserved. Campbell's helmet from the ill-fated run is also on display.\n\n==Restoration==\nOn Thursday 7 December 2006, Gina Campbell, Campbell's daughter, gave Bluebird K7 to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust. In agreement with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the museum, Bill Smith is to organise the restoration of the boat.<ref name=\"bbc7nov2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-37890287|title=Donald Campbell's Bluebird roars back to life|date=7 November 2016|publisher=BBC News|language=English|accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref> The intention is to rebuild K7 back to running order circa 4 January 1967.\n\nBy May 2009, permission had been received for a one off set of proving trials of Bluebird on Coniston Water, where she will be tested to a safe speed for demonstration purposes only. There was no fixed date for completion of Bluebird K7 or the trials.

A '''downward directed set''' is defined analogously,<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert S.

That is, all totally ordered sets are directed sets (contrast [[partially ordered sets|''partially'' ordered sets]], which need not be directed). Join [[semilattice]]s (which are partially ordered sets) are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s are directed sets both upward and downward.\n\nIn [[topology]], directed sets are used to define [[net (topology)|nets]], which generalize [[sequence]]s and unite the various notions of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] used in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Directed sets also give rise to [[direct limit]]s in [[abstract algebra]] and (more generally) [[category theory]].\n\n== Equivalent definition ==\nIn addition to the definition above, there is an equivalent definition. A '''directed set''' is a set ''A'' with a preorder such that every finite subset of ''A'' has an upper bound. In this definition, the existence of an upper bound of the [[empty set|empty subset]] implies that ''A'' is nonempty.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of directed sets include:\n* The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the ordinary order \u2264 is a directed set (and so is every [[total order|totally ordered set]]).\n* Let '''D<sub>1</sub>''' and '''D<sub>2</sub>''' be directed sets. Then the Cartesian product set '''D<sub>1</sub> <math>\\times</math> D<sub>2</sub>''' can be made into a directed set by defining (''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>) \u2264 (''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) if and only if ''n''<sub>1</sub> \u2264 ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> \u2264 ''m''<sub>2</sub>. In analogy to the [[product order]] this is the product direction on the Cartesian product.\n* It follows from previous example that the set '''N''' <math>\\times</math> '''N''' of pairs of natural numbers can be made into a directed set by defining (''n''<sub>0</sub>, ''n''<sub>1</sub>) \u2264 (''m''<sub>0</sub>, ''m''<sub>1</sub>) if and only if ''n''<sub>0</sub> \u2264 ''m''<sub>0</sub> and ''n''<sub>1</sub> \u2264 ''m''<sub>1</sub>.\n* If ''x''<sub>0</sub> is a [[real number]], we can turn the set '''R''' \u2212 {''x''<sub>0</sub>} into a directed set by writing ''a'' \u2264 ''b'' if and only if <br>|''a'' \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>| \u2265 |''b'' \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>|. We then say that the reals have been ''directed towards x<sub>0</sub>''. This is an example of a directed set that is not [[partial order|ordered]] (neither totally nor partially).\n* A (trivial) example of a partially ordered set that is '''''not''''' directed is the set {''a'', ''b''}, in which the only order relations are ''a'' \u2264 ''a'' and ''b'' \u2264 ''b''. A less trivial example is like the previous example of the \"reals directed towards x<sub>0</sub>\" but in which the ordering rule only applies to pairs of elements on the same side of x<sub>0</sub>.\n* If ''T'' is a [[topological space]] and ''x''<sub>0</sub> is a point in ''T'', we turn the set of all [[topological neighbourhood|neighbourhoods]] of ''x''<sub>0</sub> into a directed set by writing ''U'' \u2264 ''V'' if and only if ''U'' contains ''V''.\n** For every ''U'': ''U'' \u2264 ''U''; since ''U'' contains itself.\n** For every ''U'', ''V,'' and ''W'': if ''U'' \u2264 ''V'' and ''V'' \u2264 ''W'', then we have ''U'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''V'' and ''V'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''W'', which implies ''U'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''W''. Thus ''U \u2264 W.''\n** For every ''U'' and ''V'': since ''x<sub>0</sub>'' <math>\\in</math> ''U'' <math>\\cap</math> ''V'', and since both ''U'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''U <math>\\cap</math> V'' and ''V'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''U <math>\\cap</math> V'', we have ''U \u2264 U <math>\\cap</math> V'' and V ''\u2264 U <math>\\cap</math> V.''\n* In a [[poset]] ''P'', every lower closure of an element, i.e. every subset of the form {''a'' | ''a'' in ''P'', ''a'' \u2264''x''} where ''x'' is a fixed element from ''P'', is directed.\n\n== Contrast with semilattices ==\n[[File:Directed_set,_but_no_join_semi-lattice.png|thumb|x100px|Witness]]\n\nDirected sets are a more general concept than (join) semilattices: every [[semilattice|join semilattice]] is a directed set, as the join or least upper bound of two elements is the desired ''c''.  The converse does not hold however, witness the directed set {1000,0001,1101,1011,1111} [[coordinatewise order|ordered bitwise]] (e.g. 1000 \u2264 1011 holds, but 0001 \u2264 1000 does not, since in the last bit 1 > 0), where {1000,0001} has three upper bounds but no ''least'' upper bound, cf. picture. (Also note that without 1111, the set is not directed.)\n\n== Directed subsets ==\nThe order relation in a directed set is not required to be [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and therefore directed sets are not always [[partial order]]s. However, the term ''directed set'' is also used frequently in the context of posets. In this setting, a subset ''A'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',\u2264) is called a '''directed subset''' if it is a directed set according to the same partial order: in other words, it is not the [[empty set]], and every pair of elements has an upper bound. Here the order relation on the elements of ''A'' is inherited from ''P''; for this reason, reflexivity and transitivity need not be required explicitly.\n\nA directed subset of a poset is not required to be [[lower set|downward closed]]; a subset of a poset is directed if and only if its downward closure is an [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]]. While the definition of a directed set is for an \"upward-directed\" set (every pair of elements has an upper bound), it is also possible to define a downward-directed set in which every pair of elements has a common lower bound. A subset of a poset is downward-directed if and only if its upper closure is a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]].\n\nDirected subsets are used in [[domain theory]], which studies [[directed complete partial order]]s.<ref>Gierz, p. 2.</ref> These are posets in which every upward-directed set is required to have a [[least upper bound]]. In this context, directed subsets again provide a generalization of convergent sequences.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Filtered category]]\n* [[Centered set]]\n* [[Linked set]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* J.

tale set in the distant future of the year 2000. Bellamy's vision of a harmonious future world inspired the formation of at least 165 \"[[Nationalist Clubs]]\" dedicated to the propagation of Bellamy's political ideas and working to make them a practical reality.<ref>Franklln Rosemont, \"Bellamy's Radicalism Reclaimed\", in Daphne Patai (ed.), ''Looking Backward, 1988-1888.'' Amherst MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1988; pg. 201.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nEdward Bellamy was born in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]]. His father was Rufus King Bellamy (1816\u20131886), a [[Baptist]] minister and a descendant of [[Joseph Bellamy]].<ref name=Quint74>Howard Quint, ''The Forging of American Socialism: Origins of the Modern Movement: The Impact of Socialism on American Thought and Action, 1886\u20131901.''

In this capacity Bellamy briefly served on the staff of the ''[[New York Post]]'' before returning to his native Massachusetts to take a position at the ''Springfield Union.''<ref name=Quint74 />\n\nAt the age of 25, Bellamy developed [[tuberculosis]], the disease that would ultimately kill him.<ref name=Quint74 /> He suffered with its effects throughout his adult life. In an effort to regain his health, Bellamy spent a year in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (1877 to 1878).<ref name=Quint74 /> Returning to the United States, Bellamy decided to abandon the daily grind of journalism in favor of literary work, which put fewer demands upon his time and his health.<ref name=Quint74 />\n\nBellamy married Emma Augusta Sanderson in 1882. The couple had two children.\n\n===Literary career===\n\nBellamy's early novels, including ''Six to One'' (1878), ''[[Dr. Heidenhoff's Process]]'' (1880), and ''Miss Ludington's Sister'' (1885) were unremarkable works, making use of standard psychological plots.<ref>Quint, ''The Forging of American Socialism,'' pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nA turn to utopian science fiction with ''[[Looking Backward|Looking Backward, 2000\u20131887]],'' published in January 1888, captured the public imagination and catapulted Bellamy to literary fame.<ref name=Quint74 /> The publisher of the book could scarcely keep up with demand. Within a year the book had sold some 200,000 copies and by the end of the 19th century it had sold more copies than any other book published in America up to that time except for ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' by [[Lew Wallace]].<ref>Arthur E. Morgan, ''Edward Bellamy.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1944; pp. 148, 252.</ref> He also collected several short stories in 1898 and published ''The Duke of Stockbridge; a Romance of Shays' Rebellion'' in 1900.\n\n===The Bellamyite movement===\n\nAlthough Bellamy retrospectively claimed he did not write ''Looking Backward'' as a blueprint for political action, but rather sought to write \"a literary fantasy, a [[fairy tale]] of social felicity\",<ref name=Why>Edward Bellamy, \"Why I Wrote ''Looking Backward,''\" ''The Nationalist,'' vol. 2 (1890), pg. 199.</ref> the book inspired legions of inspired readers to establish so-called [[Nationalist Clubs]], beginning in Boston late in 1888.<ref name=Bliss>William D.P. Bliss and Rudolph M. Binder (eds.), ''The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform.'' New Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1908; pp. 810\u2013812.</ref> Bellamy's vision of a country relieved of its social ills through abandonment of the principle of competition and establishment of state ownership of industry proved an appealing panacea to a generation of intellectuals alienated from the dark side of [[Gilded Age]] America. By 1891 it was reported that no fewer than 162 Nationalist Clubs were in existence.<ref name=Hillquit289>Morris Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States.'' Fifth Revised and Enlarged Edition.

In the radicalness of the opinions I have expressed, I may seem to out-socialize the socialists, yet the word socialist is one I never could well stomach. In the first place it is a foreign word in itself, and equally foreign in all its suggestions. It smells to the average American of petroleum, suggests the red flag, and with all manner of sexual novelties, and an abusive tone about God and religion, which in this country we at least treat with respect. ...[W]hatever German and French reformers may choose to call themselves, socialist is not a good name for a party to succeed with in America. No such party can or ought to succeed that is not wholly and enthusiastically American and patriotic in spirit and suggestions\".<ref>Bellamy to Howells, June 17, 1888, quoted in Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 114.</ref>}}\n\nBellamy himself came to actively participate in the political movement which emerged around his book, particularly after 1891 when he founded his own magazine, ''[[New Nation (United States)|The New Nation]],'' and began to promote united action between the various Nationalist Clubs and the emerging [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]].<ref>Arthur Lipow, ''Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement.''

This phase of Bellamy's life came to an end in 1894, when ''The New Nation'' was forced to suspend publication owing to financial difficulties.<ref>Lipow, ''Authoritarian Socialism in America,'' pg. 31.</ref>\n\nWith the key activists of the Nationalist Clubs largely absorbed into the apparatus of the People's Party (although a Nationalist Party did run candidates for office in [[Wisconsin]] as late as 1896<ref>[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1897 Casson, Henry, ed.

This in turn comes from the [[Semitic alphabet|Semitic]] letter ''[[He (letter)|h\u00ea]]'', which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (''[[hillul]]'' 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented {{IPA|/h/}} (and {{IPA|/e/}} in foreign words); in Greek, ''h\u00ea'' became the letter epsilon, used to represent {{IPA|/e/}}.

New York: St. Martin's Press (1996): 3</ref> Both [[Georges Perec]]'s novel ''[[A Void (novel)|A Void]]'' (''La Disparition'') (1969) and its English translation by Gilbert Adair omit 'e' and are considered better works.<ref>Eckler (1996): 3.

This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after '''end'''), generates both cost and benefits; and, '''resources''' (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal.  If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding '''actors''' (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a '''decision''') but rather explore other alternatives.

These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light [[government regulation]].{{clarify|date=July 2017}} The item traded may be a tangible [[product (business)|product]] such as apples or a [[Service (economics)|service]] such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.\n\nIn theory, in a [[free market]] the [[Aggregation problem|aggregates]] (sum of) of ''quantity demanded'' by buyers and ''quantity supplied'' by sellers may reach [[economic equilibrium]] over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached may not necessarily be [[Equity (economics)|morally equitable]]. For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by [[exogenous|external factors]], the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it.\n\nVarious market structures exist. In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive markets]], no participants are large enough to have the [[market power]] to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a \"price taker\" as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience [[imperfect competition]].\n\nForms include [[monopoly]] (in which there is only one seller of a good), [[duopoly]] (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), [[monopolistic competition]] (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), [[monopsony]] (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and [[oligopsony]] (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be \"price makers\", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.\n\nMicroeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as [[supply and demand|partial-equilibrium]] analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. [[General equilibrium|General-equilibrium]] theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across ''all'' markets.

Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way.  The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|output forgone]], [[leisure]], or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ([[utility]]).<ref>{{cite web |website=[[The Economist]] Economics A-Z |url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=OPPORTUNITY+COST |title=Opportunity Cost |access-date=3 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nInputs used in the production process include such primary [[factors of production]] as [[Labour (economics)|labour services]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and [[Land (economics)|land]] (including natural resources). Other inputs may include [[intermediate good]]s used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.\n\n[[Economic efficiency]] measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available [[technology]]. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of \"waste\" is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is [[Pareto efficiency]], which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.\n\n[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|An example [[production\u2013possibility frontier]] with illustrative points marked.]]\nThe [[production\u2013possibility frontier]] (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an [[economy]] can produce just two goods (say \"guns\" and \"butter\"). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows [[Potential output|potential total output]] for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.\n\n[[Scarcity]] is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume ''beyond the PPF'' (such as at ''X'') and by the negative slope of the curve.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montani |first=Guido |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001949 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3485|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Scarcity }}</ref> If production of one good ''increases'' along the curve, production of the other good ''decreases'', an [[inverse relationship]]. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter.\n\nThe [[slope]] of the curve at a point on it gives the [[trade-off#Examples from common life|trade-off]] between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a ''real opportunity cost''. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. ''Along the PPF'', scarcity implies that choosing ''more'' of one good in the aggregate entails doing with ''less'' of the other good. Still, in a [[market economy]], movement along the curve may indicate that the [[utility|choice]] of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.\n\nBy construction, each point on the curve shows ''[[productive efficiency]]'' in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point ''inside'' the curve (as at ''A''), is feasible but represents ''production inefficiency'' (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of ''one or both goods'' could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high [[unemployment]] during a [[business cycle|business-cycle]] [[recession]] or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy [[allocative efficiency]] (also called [[Pareto efficiency]]) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.\n\nMuch [[applied economics]] in [[public policy]] is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved.

Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in [[stock and flow|stocks]] of [[human capital]] per worker or [[capital (economics)|capital]]/[[labor force|labour]] ratios. According to theory, this may give a [[comparative advantage]] in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus ''relatively'' cheaper, input.\n\nEven if one region has an [[absolute advantage]] as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.\n\nIt has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries.

In [[microeconomics]], it applies to price and output determination for a market with [[perfect competition]], which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting [[market power|power]].\n\nFor a given market of a [[Good (economics and accounting)|commodity]], ''demand'' is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). [[consumer theory|Demand theory]] describes individual consumers as [[rational choice theory|rationally]] choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is \"constrained utility maximization\" (with income and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] as the [[budget constraint|constraints]] on demand). Here, [[utility]] refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.\n\nThe [[law of demand]] states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things [[ceteris paribus|unchanged]]). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the [[substitution effect]]). In addition, [[purchasing power]] from the price decline increases ability to buy (the [[income effect]]). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a [[normal good]] outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.\n\n''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be ''profit maximizers'', meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.\n\nThat is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The \"Law of Supply\" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.\n\n[[Market equilibrium]] occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The [[Model (economics)|model]] of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.\n\nFor a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or [[marginal utility]], to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=William Baumol |last=Baumol |first=William J. |date=28 April 2016 |title=Utility and Value |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/utility-economics}}</ref> The corresponding point on the supply curve measures [[marginal cost]], the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.<ref name=\"Hicks\">{{cite book |title=Value and Capital: An Inquiry into Some Fundamental Principles of Economic Theory |last=Hicks |first=J.R. |authorlink=John Hicks|orig-year=1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=second |date=2001 |location=London |isbn=978-0-19-828269-3|title-link=Value and Capital }}</ref>\n\nOn the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) ''variable'' in the [[short run]], which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively ''fixed'', such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the [[long run]], all inputs may be adjusted by [[management]]. These distinctions translate to differences in the [[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity]] (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.\n\n[[marginalism|Marginalist theory]], such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to [[Income#Meaning in economics and use in economic theory|income]] and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares [[marginal revenue]] (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the [[marginal cost]] of a good, with ''marginal profit'' the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change \"at the margin\": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.\n\nOther applications of demand and supply include the [[Distribution (economics)|distribution of income]] among the [[factors of production]], including labour and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive [[labour market]] for example the quantity of labour employed and the price of labour (the wage rate) depends on the [[Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomic model&nbsp;\u2014 Demand|demand for labour]] (from employers for production) and supply of labour (from potential workers). [[Labour economics]] examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labour income, [[labour mobility]], and (un)employment, productivity through [[human capital]], and related public-policy issues.<ref>\u2022 {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Richard B.

Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others.

It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with [[barter]] (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate [[double coincidence of wants]] as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book.

When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an [[output gap]] where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government.\n\nFor example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have [[Fiscal multiplier|multiplier effects]] where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity.\n\nThe effects of fiscal policy can be limited by [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.\n\nSceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of [[Ricardian equivalence]]. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes.\n\n==International economics==\n{{Main|International economics}}\n[[File:Countries by GDP (PPP) Per Capita in 2014.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita in 2014.]]\nInternational trade studies determinants of goods-and-services flows across international boundaries. It also concerns the size and distribution of [[gains from trade]]. Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing [[tariff]] rates and trade quotas. [[International finance]] is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders, and the effects of these movements on [[exchange rate]]s.

Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs.

The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1848 |title=Principles of Political Economy |publisher=John W.

These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution.{{efn|\"This science indicates the cases in which commerce is truly productive, where whatever is gained by one is lost by another, and where it is profitable to all; it also teaches us to appreciate its several processes, but simply in their results, at which it stops. Besides this knowledge, the merchant must also understand the processes of his art. He must be acquainted with the commodities in which he deals, their qualities and defects, the countries from which they are derived, their markets, the means of their transportation, the values to be given for them in exchange, and the method of keeping accounts. The same remark is applicable to the agriculturist, to the manufacturer, and to the practical man of business; to acquire a thorough knowledge of the causes and consequences of each phenomenon, the study of political economy is essentially necessary to them all; and to become expert in his particular pursuit, each one must add thereto a knowledge of its processes.\" {{harv|Say|1803|page=XVI}} }} Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word \"wealth\" for \"goods and services\" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]] noticed that this definition no longer sufficed,{{efn|\"And when we submit the definition in question to this test, it is seen to possess deficiencies which, so far from being marginal and subsidiary, amount to nothing less than a complete failure to exhibit either the scope or the significance of the most central generalisations of all.\"{{harv|Robbins|2007|p=5}} }} because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity,{{efn|\"The conception we have adopted may be described as analytical. It does not attempt to pick out certain kinds of behaviour, but focuses attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity. {{harv|Robbins|2007|p=17}} }} which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science.\"\n\nCiting Robbins: \"Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\".{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Defining Economics: the Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |first1=Roger E. |last1=Backhouse |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |work=Lionel Robbins's essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, 75th anniversary conference proceedings |date=10 December 2007 |pp=209\u2013230 |url=http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/LionelRobbinsConferenceProveedingsVolume.pdf#page=213 |ref=harv}} also published in {{cite journal |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |date=October 2009 |volume=76 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=805\u2013820 |jstor=40268907 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x|last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E |last2=Medema |first2=Steve G }}</ref> Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition.{{sfnp|Backhouse|Medema|2007|page=223|ps=: \"There remained division over whether economics was defined by a method or a subject matter but both sides in that debate could increasingly accept some version of the Robbins definition.\"}} Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.\n\nA body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[Marginalist Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910.

Modern [[mainstream economics]] builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as [[econometrics]], [[game theory]], analysis of [[market failure]] and [[imperfect competition]], and the [[neoclassical model]] of [[economic growth]] for analysing long-run variables affecting [[national income]].\n\nNeoclassical economics studies the behaviour of [[individual]]s, [[household]]s, and [[organization]]s (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use [[Scarcity|scarce]] resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a [[Decision theory|decision]] (choice) is made by one or more resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Leigh |last=Tesfatsion |title=Agent-Based Computational Economics: Growing Economies from the Bottom Up |journal=[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]] |date=Winter 2002 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201382 |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acealife.pdf |pmid=12020421 |doi=10.1162/106454602753694765|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.4605 }}</ref> They are the focus of economic analysis.{{efn|See [[Agent-based computational economics]]}}\n\nAn approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity, may go as follows:\n\nThe continuous interplay (exchange or trade) done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, as well as the remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent).{{efn|Interest payments are considered a form of rent on credit money.}} Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.{{efn|See [[Complex adaptive system]] and [[Dynamic network analysis]]}}\n\n===Keynesian economics===\n{{Main|Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian economics|}}\n[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] (right), was a key theorist in economics.]]\n\nKeynesian economics derives from [[John Maynard Keynes]], in particular his book ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' (1936), which ushered in contemporary [[macroeconomics]] as a distinct field.<ref>\u2022 {{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |publisher= Macmillan|year=1936 |location=London |isbn=978-1-57392-139-8 |title-link=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money }}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2022 {{harvp|Blaug|2017|p=347}}</ref> The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible.

Policy issues featured in one survey of [[American Economic Association]] economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.{{sfnp|Whaples|2009}}\n\nIn ''Steady State Economics'' 1977, leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] argues that there exist logical inconsistencies between the emphasis placed on economic growth and the limited availability of natural resources.<ref name=\"Daly1991\">{{cite book|last=Daly|first=Herman E.|authorlink=Herman Daly|title=Steady-State Economics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmp5mPdJ474C&pg=PA98|edition=second|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-59726-872-1|pages=98\u2013128|chapter=The Catechism of Growth Fallacies}}</ref>\n\nIssues like [[central bank]] independence, central bank policies and rhetoric in central bank governors discourse or the premises of [[Macroeconomic policy|macroeconomic policies]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Johan |last=Scholvinck |title=Making the Case for the Integration of Social and Economic Policy |website=UN Division for Social Policy and Development |url=http://www.icsw.org/publications/sdr/2002-june/un-division.htm |archive-date=18 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118193838/http://www.icsw.org/publications/sdr/2002-june/un-division.htm}}</ref> ([[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[fiscal policy]]) of the [[State (polity)|state]], are focus of contention and criticism.<ref>\u2022 {{cite journal |first1=Bernd |last1=Hayo |first2=Carsten |last2=Hefeker |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpma/0103006.html |title=Do We Really Need Central Bank Independence?

Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were \"trotted out ''[[ex post]]''\".

If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements ([[pixel]]s), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.\n\nElectrophoretic displays are considered prime examples of the electronic paper category, because of their paper-like appearance and low power consumption.\n\nExamples of commercial electrophoretic displays include the high-resolution [[active matrix]] displays used in the [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes & Noble Nook]], [[Sony Librie]], [[Sony Reader]], [[Kobo eReader]] and [[iRex iLiad]] e-readers. These displays are constructed from an electrophoretic imaging film manufactured by [[E Ink Corporation]]. A mobile phone that used the technology is the [[Motorola Fone]].\n\nElectrophoretic Display technology has also been developed by [[Sipix]] and [[Bridgestone]]/Delta.\nSiPix is now part of E Ink.

Albert, [[Barrett Comiskey]], Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded [[E Ink Corporation]] in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with [[Philips|Philips Components]] two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to [[Prime View International]].  <blockquote>\"It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1\u20135 \u03bcm), quite distinct from the  molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-[[Lambertian reflectance|lambertian]] viewing characteristic, result in an 'ink on paper' look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6690/abs/394253a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1998-07-16|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 253\u2013255|volume = 394|issue = 6690|doi = 10.1038/28349|first = Barrett|last = Comiskey|first2 = J.

This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.\nOne early version of electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white [[titanium dioxide]] particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively [[electric charge|charged]], and each one is naturally white.<ref name=\"newscientist_1\" />\nThe screen holds microcapsules in a layer of [[liquid]] [[polymer]], sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.\nThe network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |newspaper=New Scientist |title=Roll The Presses |date=24 April 2001 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn659-roll-the-presses.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=John A |last1=Rogers |first2=Zhenan |last2=Bao |first3=Kirk |last3=Baldwin |first4=Ananth |last4=Dodabalapur |first5=Brian |last5=Crone |first6=V R |last6=Raju |first7=Valerie |last7=Kuck |first8=Howard |last8=Katz |first9=Karl |last9=Amundson |first10=Jay |last10=Ewing |first11=Paul |last11=Drzaic |title=Paper-like electronic displays: Large-area rubber-stamped plastic sheets of electronics and microencapsulated electrophoretic inks |date=24 April 2001 |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=4835\u20134840 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4835.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.091588098 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |pmid=11320233 |pmc=33123}}</ref>\n\n===Electrowetting===\n{{Main|Electrowetting}}\nElectro-wetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.\n\nDisplays based on [[Electrowetting|electro-wetting]] provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content.<ref>{{citation |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=26 July 2010 |title=Oil-based color pixels could let you watch videos on e-paper |url=http://www.physorg.com/news199330889.html |newspaper=PhysOrg |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> It's a low-power and low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies.<ref>LiquaVista electrowetting display technologies http://www.liquavista.com</ref> Instead of using red, green and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electro-wetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.\n\nThis results in the availability of two thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.\n\nThe colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing for example. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |date=October 2, 2003 |title=The Hindu: Technology for reflective full-color display}}</ref>\n\nExamples of commercial electrowetting displays include [[Liquavista]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquavista.com|title=Home - Liquavista - Electrowetting based low power, always viewable color video displays|publisher=}}</ref> [[ITRI]],<ref>[http://www.itri.org.tw/eng/news-and-events/feature-story-detail.asp?RootNodeId=050&NodeId=0502&FocusNewsNBR=52] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and [[ADT (company)|ADT]].<ref>Blankenbach K, Schmoll A, Bitman A, Bartels F and Jerosch D 2008 Novel highly reflective and bistable electrowetting displays SID J. 16 237\u201344</ref><ref>http://www.iop.org/Select/article/0960-1317/19/6/065029/jmm9_6_065029.pdf?request-id=37ba45f3-e740-4c0d-8c35-dcf2d9af1f10</ref>\n\n====Electrofluidic====\n[[Electrofluidic display]]s are a variation of an electrowetting display. Electrofluidic displays place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir.  The reservoir comprises <5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gamma Dynamic Technology|url=http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|publisher=Gamma Dynamics|accessdate=1 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303154148/http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|archive-date=3 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate.  As a result, the display takes on color and brightness similar to that of conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir.  As reported in the May 2009 Issue of Nature Photonics{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, the technology can potentially provide >85 % white state reflectance for electronic paper.\n\nThe core technology was invented at the Novel Devices Laboratory at the [[University of Cincinnati]].

The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on the thickness of the insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5&nbsp;mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent.Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.\n\n===Other bistable displays===\n{{See also|Bistability}}\n* [[Plastic Logic]], manufacturer of flexible plastic electrophoretic displays<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticlogic.com|title=Glass-free EPD - Flexible electronics manufacturing by Plastic Logic|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Kent Displays]], manufacturer of [[cholesteric liquid crystal display]] ([[ChLCD]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentdisplays.com/|title=Kent Displays - Makers of Boogie Board|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Nemoptic]], [[nematic]] materials<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemoptic.com|title=nemoptic.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n* TRED<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treddisplays.com/|title=\u4f4f\u5b85\u3092\u4f4f\u307f\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30ea\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3057\u3088\u3046|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Sharp Memory LCD, used in [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble smartwatch]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200255/http://www.sharpmemorylcd.com/aboutmemorylcd.html Sharp Memory LCD]</ref>\n\n===Other technologies===\nOther research efforts into e-paper have involved using [[OFET|organic transistors]] embedded into [[flexible substrate]]s,<ref name=\"organic_transistors\">{{cite journal | last1 = Huitema | first1 = H.

This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard [[mobile device]]s. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.\n\n[[Image:e-ink ghost.jpg|thumb|right|An e-ink screen showing the \"ghost\" of a prior image]]\n\nAnother limit is that a shadow of an image may be visible after refreshing parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed \"ghost images\", and the effect is termed \"ghosting\". This effect is reminiscent of [[screen burn-in]] but, unlike screen burn-in, is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology \"flash\" the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nE Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. released the first colored e-ink displays to be used in a marketed product.

While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:\n\n* A method for encapsulation\n* An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation\n* Electronics to activate the ink\n\nElectronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials.  For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets.  Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.\n\nThere are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic]] displays, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch A Sketch]] at Kyushu University.  Advantages of electronic paper includes low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays.  Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts.  The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop [[rollable display]]s for electronic devices.\n\n[[Image:Motorola F3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The [[Motorola FONE F3|Motorola F3]] uses an e-paper display instead of an LCD.]]\n\n===Wristwatches===\nIn December 2005 [[Seiko]] released the first electronic ink based watch called the Spectrum SVRD001 wristwatch, which has a [[rollable display|flexible]] electrophoretic display<ref>\n[http://www.akihabaranews.com//en/news-10749-The+first+watch+that+uses+flexible+e-paper+hits+the+stores.html \"The first watch that uses flexible e-paper hits the stores\"]\n2005-12-01\n</ref> and in March 2010 Seiko released a second generation of this famous e-ink watch with an active matrix display.<ref>[http://www.seikowatches.com/baselworld/2010/precon/0402-epd.html \"Baselworld 2010 - Seiko Press Conference - Future Now, EPD Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325033542/http://www.seikowatches.com/baselworld/2010/precon/0402-epd.html |date=2010-03-25 }}\n2010-04-01\n</ref> The [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] smart watch (2013) uses a low-power memory [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] manufactured by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] for its e-paper display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Pebble%20Teardown/13319/1|title=Pebble Teardown|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===E-book readers===\n[[Image:Bouquin \u00e9lectronique iLiad en plein soleil.jpg|thumb|[[iLiad]] e-book reader equipped with an e-paper display visible in the sunlight]]\n{{Main|Comparison of e-book readers}}\nIn 2004 [[Sony]] released the [[Sony LIBRI\u00e9 EBR-1000EP|Libri\u00e9]] in Japan, the first e-book reader with an electronic paper [[E Ink]] display.

In September 2012, Amazon announced the fifth generation of the Kindle called the Paperwhite, which incorporates a LED frontlight and a higher contrast display.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3296627/amazon-new-kindle-paperwhite-announcement | title=Kindle Paperwhite e-reader announced, $119 Wi-Fi and $179 3G models ship October 1st | accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, Barnes and Noble launched the [[Barnes & Noble Nook]], running an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It differs from other e-readers in having a replaceable battery, and a separate touch-screen color LCD below the main electronic paper reading screen.\n\nIn 2017 Sony and reMarkable offered e-books tailored for writing with a smart [[stylus]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/sony-and-remarkables-dueling-e-paper-tablets-are-strange-but-impressive-beasts/|title=Sony and reMarkable's dueling e-paper tablets are strange but impressive beasts|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Newspapers===\nIn February 2006, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] daily ''[[De Tijd]]'' distributed an electronic version of the paper to select subscribers in a limited marketing study, using a pre-release version of the [[iRex iLiad]].  This was the first recorded application of electronic ink to newspaper publishing.\n\nThe [[French language|French]] daily ''[[Les \u00c9chos (France)|Les \u00c9chos]]'' announced the official launch of an electronic version of the paper on a subscription basis, in September 2007. Two offers were available, combining a one-year subscription and a reading device. The offer included either a light (176g) reading device (adapted for Les Echos by Ganaxa) or the [[iRex iLiad]]. Two different processing platforms were used to deliver readable information of the daily, one based on the newly developed GPP electronic ink platform from ''[[Ganaxa]]'', and the other one developed internally by Les Echos.\n\n===Displays embedded in smart cards===\nFlexible display cards enable financial payment cardholders to generate a [[one-time password]] to reduce [[online banking]] and transaction fraud. Electronic paper offers a flat and thin alternative to existing [[key fob]] tokens for data security. The world's first ISO compliant [[smart card]] with an embedded display was developed by Innovative Card Technologies and nCryptone in 2005. The cards were manufactured by Nagra ID.\n\n===Status displays===\n[[Image:Lexar Jumpdrive Secure II Plus.jpg|thumb|USB flash drive with E Ink-implemented capacity meter of available flash memory]]\nSome devices, like [[USB flash drive]]s, have used electronic paper to display status information, such as available storage space.<ref>{{cite web|title=LEXAR ADDS INNOVATIVE STORAGE CAPACITY METER WITH ELECTRONIC PAPER DISPLAY FROM E INK |url=http://www.eink.com/press_releases/lexar_usb_drive_using_e_ink_010306.html |publisher=Eink - Press Release |accessdate=1 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014111900/http://www.eink.com/press_releases/lexar_usb_drive_using_e_ink_010306.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}</ref>  Once the image on the electronic paper has been set, it requires no power to maintain, so the readout can be seen even when the flash drive is not plugged in.\n\n===Mobile phones===\nMotorola's low-cost mobile phone, the [[Motorola FONE F3|Motorola F3]], uses an alphanumeric black-and-white electrophoretic display.\n\nThe [[Samsung SCH-U750|Samsung Alias 2]] mobile phone incorporates electronic ink from E Ink into the keypad, which allows the keypad to change character sets and orientation while in different display modes.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, [[Yota|Yota Devices]] announced the first \"YotaPhone\" prototype and was later released in December 2013, a unique double-display smartphone. It has a 4.3-inch, HD LCD on the front and an e-ink display on the back with smart battery usage.\n\n===Electronic shelf labels===\n{{main|Electronic shelf label}}\nE-Paper based [[electronic shelf label]]s (ESL) are used to digitally display the prices of goods at retail stores. Electronic paper based labels are updated via two-way infrared or radio technology.\n\n===Digital signage===\n{{main|Digital signage}}\nBecause of its energy-saving properties, electronic paper has proved a technology suited to digital signage applications.\n\n===Other===\nOther proposed applications include clothes, digital photo frames, information boards and keyboards. Keyboards with dynamically changeable keys are useful for less represented languages, non-standard keyboard layouts such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]], or for special non-alphabetical applications such as video editing or games.\n\n==Display manufacturers==\n* [[E Ink Corporation|E Ink Holdings Inc.]]\n* [[Liquavista]]\n* [[LG]]  The LG.Philips LCD invented the world first flexible E-paper in October, 2005. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mk.co.kr/cp/pop/desc.php?from=E&to=F&page=0&so=common|title=::\uc99d\uad8c\uc6a9\uc5b4\uc0ac\uc804::|website=dic.mk.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-09}}</ref>\n* [[NEC]]\n* [[Plastic Logic]]\n* [[Polymer Vision]]\n* [[Samsung]]\n* [[Seiko Epson]]\n* CLEARink\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of display technology]]\n* [[Electrofluidic]]\n* [[Flexible electronics]]\n* [[E-book]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16221864.700-paper-goes-electric.html Electric paper], New Scientist, 2003\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4202 E-paper may offer video images], New Scientist, 2003\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17924141.200 Paper comes alive] New Scientist, 2003\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4602 Most flexible electronic paper yet revealed], New Scientist, 2004\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/mech-tech/mg18524907.100 Roll-up digital displays move closer to market] New Scientist, 2005\n\n==External links==\n<!--Links to product sites for the sake of advertising will be removed.

The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed.

Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.<ref name=\"moran2005\"/>\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.<ref name=\"berger2002\"/> [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.<ref name=rahmstorf2003/>\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.<ref name=\"moran2005\" /> Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.<ref name=hydrologic_cycle/>\n\nThe amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.<ref name=sadava_heller2006/> Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.<ref name=climate_zones/>\n\nThis latitudinal rule has several anomalies:\n* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].\n* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref> In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.\n* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion.

This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.<ref name=jas31_4_1118/> The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.<ref name=sci293_5531_839/> Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.<ref name=abedon1997/> In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape.

The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]].

Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.\n\nAbove the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.<ref name=bromberg2008/>\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=lin2006/> The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=fisher19960205/>\n\nIn modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%<ref group=\"n\" name=\"solar_energy\"/> in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year.

It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].\n[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth\u2013Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth\u2013Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]\n\nDue to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&nbsp;[[Microsecond|\u00b5s]]/yr\u2014add up to significant changes.<ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/> During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.<ref name=aaa428_261/> Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.<ref name=nature410_6830_773/>\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.<ref name=angular /> This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.<ref name=nature412_708/>\n\n==Asteroids and artificial satellites==\n[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] viewing Earth from the [[ISS]] Cupola, 2010]]\nEarth has at least five [[Quasi-satellite|co-orbital asteroids]], including [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}.<ref name=whitehouse20021021/><ref name=christou_asher2011/> A [[Earth trojan|trojan asteroid]] companion, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, is librating around the leading [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange triangular point]], L4, in the [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]].<ref name=Connors/><ref name=Choi/>\n\nThe tiny [[near-Earth asteroid]] {{mpl|2006 RH|120}} makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years.

The flow eroded the retaining ridge, causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water into the Atlantic. After multiple episodes of changing sea level, during which the ''Fosses Dangeard'' were largely infilled by various layers of sediment, another catastrophic flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley, the [[Lobourg Channel]], some 500 m wide and 25 m deep, from the southern North Sea basin through the centre of the Straits of Dover and into the English Channel. It left streamlined islands, longitudinal erosional grooves, and other features characteristic of catastrophic [[megaflood]] events, still present on the sea floor and now revealed by high-resolution sonar.<ref>Two-stage opening of the Dover Strait and the origin of island Britain.

Successful invasions include the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, while the concentration of excellent harbours in the Western Channel on Britain's south coast made possible the largest invasion of all time, the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944.

In 55 BC [[Julius Caesar]] invaded, claiming that the Britons had aided the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] against him the previous year. He was more successful in 54 BC, but Britain was not fully established as part of the Roman Empire until completion of the invasion by [[Aulus Plautius]] in 43 AD. A brisk and regular trade began between ports in Roman [[Gaul]] and those in Britain. This traffic continued until the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in 410 AD, after which the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early Anglo-Saxons]] left less clear historical records.\n\nIn the power vacuum left by the retreating Romans, the Germanic [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]] began the next great migration across the North Sea. Having already been used as mercenaries in Britain by the Romans, many people from these tribes crossed during the [[Migration Period]], conquering and perhaps displacing the native [[Celt]]ic populations.<ref>{{cite web\n| title =Germany The migration period\n| url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-58084/Germany\n| accessdate = 24 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Norsemen and Normans ===\n[[File:Hermitage St Helier Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|The Hermitage of [[Helier|St Helier]] lies in the bay off [[Saint Helier]] and is accessible on foot at low tide.]]\n\nThe attack on [[Lindisfarne]] in 793 is generally considered the beginning of the [[Viking Age]]. For the next 250&nbsp;years the Scandinavian raiders of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark dominated the North Sea, raiding monasteries, homes, and towns along the coast and along the rivers that ran inland. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' they began to settle in Britain in 851. They continued to settle in the [[British Isles]] and the continent until around 1050.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Nick Attwood MA\n| title =The Holy Island of Lindisfarne \u2013 The Viking Attack\n| url =http://www.lindisfarne.org.uk/793/index.htm\n| accessdate = 24 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Duchy of Normandy|fiefdom of Normandy]] was created for the [[Viking]] leader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]] (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]] [[Charles the Simple]] through the [[Treaty of St.-Claire-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \"Northman\") origins.\n\nThe descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's inhabitants and became the [[Normans]] \u2013 a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Hiberno-Norse]], [[Orkney|Orcadians]], [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]], and indigenous [[Franks]] and [[Gauls]].\n\nRollo's descendant [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]] became king of England in 1066 in the [[Norman Conquest]] beginning with the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of [[John of England|King John]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], while insular Normandy (the [[Channel Islands]]) remained under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.\n\nWith the rise of [[William the Conqueror]] the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia's trade south, toward the [[Mediterranean]] and the Orient.\n\nAlthough the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for [[Chausey]]) are [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]]. Thus the [[Loyal toast]] in the Channel Islands is ''La Reine, notre Duc'' (\"The Queen, our Duke\"). The British monarch is understood to ''not'' be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris of 1259]], the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to [[Salic Law]] which excludes inheritance through female heirs.\n\nFrench Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1346\u20131360 and again in 1415\u20131450.\n\n=== England and Britain: Naval superpower ===\nFrom the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent [[sea power]] of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] with [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] second in command, and the following stormy weather. Over the centuries the [[Royal Navy]] slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =britishbattles.com\n| title =The Spanish Armada: Sir Francis Drake\n| year =2007\n| url =http://www.britishbattles.com/spanish-war/spanish-armada.htm\n| accessdate = 24 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe building of the [[British Empire]] was possible only because the [[Royal Navy]] eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, especially the Channel and the North Sea. During the [[Seven Years' War]], France attempted to [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|launch an invasion of Britain]]. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759.\n\nAnother significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Battle of Trafalgar]] took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], ending [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.\n\n=== First World War ===\nThe exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the First Sea Lord [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] in the years before [[World War I]]. \"Five keys lock up the world! Singapore, the Cape, [[Alexandria]], Gibraltar, Dover.\"<ref>{{Cite book| author=Geoffrey Miller| url=http://www.manorhouse.clara.net/book3/chapter2.htm| title=The Millstone: Chapter 2| accessdate=1 November 2008}} quoting Fisher, ''Naval Necessities I'', p. 219</ref> However, on 25 July 1909 [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]] made the first Channel crossing from [[Calais]] to [[Dover]] in an aeroplane. Bl\u00e9riot's crossing signalled the end of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.\n\nBecause the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed [[submarine warfare]], which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The [[Dover Patrol]] was set up just before the war started to escort cross-Channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.\n\nOn land, the German army attempted to capture Channel ports in the [[Race to the Sea]] but although the trenches are often said to have stretched \"from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel\", they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in [[Flanders]] was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.\n\nAt the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of [[U-boat]]s through the Dover Strait with [[naval mine]]fields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a {{convert|25|km|mi}} stretch of light steel netting called the [[Dover Barrage]], which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - The Dover Barrage|website=www.firstworldwar.com}}</ref> On 31 January 1917, the Germans restarted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| archive-url=https://archive.is/20080310175335/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| dead-url=yes| archive-date=10 March 2008| title=U-Boat warfare at the Atlantic during World War I| publisher=German Notes| accessdate=1 November 2008 }}</ref> the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.\n\nThe [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of [[convoy]]s and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights. A German attack on these vessels resulted in the [[Battle of Dover Strait (1917)|Battle of Dover Strait in 1917]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E_TE_ARPXdMC&pg=PA74&dq=%22Dover+Barrage%22+1917#v=onepage&q=%22Dover%20Barrage%22%201917&f=false |first=Robert M. |last=Grant, |title=U-Boats Destroyed: The Effect of Anti-Submarine Warfare 1914\u20131918 |publisher=Periscope Publishing Ltd |year=2002 |isbn=1-904381-00-6 |pages=74\u201375}}</ref> A much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage, by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the [[Admiralty M-N Scheme]] but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sotonwss.org.uk/blackjack/Sep09BJ.pdf|title=''Black Jack'' (Quarterly Magazine Southampton Branch World Ship Society) Issue No: 152 Autumn 2009: (p.6) SHOREHAM TOWERS \u2013 One of the Admiralty's greatest engineering secrets, Reproduced from Engineering & Technology IET Magazine May 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe naval blockade in the Channel and North Sea was one of the decisive factors in the German defeat in 1918.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://uboat.net/history/wwi/part6.htm| title=His Imperial German Majesty's U-boats in WWI: 6.

The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and was succeeded by two separate organisations: [[CSA (Ltd)]] and the [[Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation]] (CSPF). Both observe and authenticate cross-Channel swims in the Strait of Dover.

Its base is square, measuring {{convert|125|m|ft|0}} on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the [[Washington Monument]] to become the [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world#Timeline of world's tallest freestanding structures|tallest man-made structure]] in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]] was finished in 1930.

Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the [[List of tallest structures in France|second tallest free-standing structure in France]] after the [[Millau Viaduct]].\n\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is {{convert|276|m|abbr=on}} above the ground \u2013 the highest [[observation deck]] accessible to the public in the [[European Union]]. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or [[elevator|lift]] to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to [[Maurice Koechlin]] and [[\u00c9mile Nouguier]], two senior engineers working for the [[Gustave Eiffel|Compagnie des \u00c9tablissements Eiffel]]. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Exposition Universelle]], a [[world's fair]] to celebrate the centennial of the [[French Revolution]]. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the [[Latting Observatory]] built in New York City in 1853.<ref>{{cite book|title=Engineering News and American Railway Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jipKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA482|volume=22|year=1889|publisher=G. H. Frost|page=482}}</ref> In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".<ref>Harvie, p. 78.</ref> Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked [[Stephen Sauvestre]], the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\n\n[[File:Maurice koechlin pylone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|First drawing of the Eiffel Tower by Maurice Koechlin including size comparison with other Parisian landmarks such as [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the [[\u00cele aux Cygnes#Statue of Liberty replica|Statue of Liberty]] and the [[Vend\u00f4me Column]]]]\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Ing\u00e9nieurs Civils}}; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise, {{quote|style=text-align:justify|text=Not only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.<ref name=\"loyrette116\">Loyrette, p. 116.</ref>}}\n\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] was re-elected as president of France and [[\u00c9douard Lockroy]] was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.<ref name=\"loyrette116\"/> (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\n\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.<ref>Loyrette, p. 121.</ref>\n\n===Artists' protest===\n[[File:Caricature Gustave Eiffel.png|thumb|upright|Caricature of Gustave Eiffel comparing the Eiffel tower to the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]]]]\n\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as [[Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Jules Massenet]]. A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, [[Jean-Charles Alphand|Charles Alphand]], and it was published by ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'' on 14 February 1887:\n\n{{quote|style=text-align:justify|We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection \u2026 of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower \u2026 To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.

Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"<ref name=\"SouriauSouriau1983\">{{cite book|author1=Paul Souriau|author2=Manon Souriau|title=The Aesthetics of Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CzUTXhzDb8C&pg=PR7|year=1983|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0-87023-412-9|page=100}}</ref> These criticisms were also dealt with by [[\u00c9douard Lockroy]] in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,<ref>Harvie, p. 99.</ref> \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\n\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"<ref>Loyrette, p. 176.</ref>\n\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.<ref name=times1_4_89 >{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=The Eiffel Tower|section=News|day_of_week=Monday|date=1 April 1889|page_number=5|issue=32661|column=B|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS84463745&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0}}</ref> [[Guy de Maupassant]] supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.<ref name=\"Jonnes2009\">{{cite book|author=Jill Jonnes|title=Eiffel's Tower: And the World's Fair where Buffalo Bill Beguiled Paris, the Artists Quarreled, and Thomas Edison Became a Count|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU2VpmfnXr4C|year=2009|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-02060-7|pages=163\u201364}}</ref>\n\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a [[calligram]]) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.<ref name=\"ApollinaireGreet1980\">{{cite book|author=Guillaume Apollinaire|editor=Anne Hyde Greet|title=Calligrammes: Poems of Peace and War (1913\u20131916)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FviP1Cl3jcC|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01968-3|pages=411\u2013414}}</ref> Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of [[structural art]], and is often featured in films and literature.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Les fondations de la Tour Eiffel, ma\u00e7onneries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Foundation (engineering)|Foundations]] of the Eiffel Tower]]\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.<ref name=origins>{{cite web |url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/69.html |title=Origins and construction of the Eiffel Tower |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731073057/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/69.html |archivedate=31 July 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river [[Seine]], were more complicated: each slab needed two [[deep foundation|piles]] installed by using compressed-air [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]]s {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter driven to a depth of {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>Loyrette, p. 123.</ref> to support the concrete slabs, which were {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of [[limestone]] with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\n\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts {{convert|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.<ref>Loyrette, p. 148.</ref> The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within {{convert|0.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} and angles worked out to one [[arcsecond|second of arc]]. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]] and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5&nbsp;million rivets.<ref name=origins/>\n\nAt first the legs were constructed as [[cantilever]]s, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber [[scaffold]]. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.<ref>Harvie, p. 110.</ref> At this stage, a small \"creeper\" [[crane (machine)|crane]] designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.<ref name=origins/> Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; [[hydraulic]] [[Jack (device)|jacks]] were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by [[Sand box (civil engineering)|sandboxes]] on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,<ref name=origins/> only one person died, due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wonders-of-the-world.net/Eiffel-Tower/Construction-of-the-Eiffel-tower.php|work=wonders-of-the-world.net|title=Construction of the Eiffel Tower}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel.JPG|The start of the erection of the metalwork.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel2.JPG|7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel3.JPG|20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel4.JPG|15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel6.JPG|26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\nFile:Construction tour eiffel7.JPG|15 March 1889: Construction of the [[cupola]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Lifts====\n[[File:Tour Eiffel Ascenseur Roux, Combaluzier et Lepape.jpg|thumb|The Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape lifts during construction. Note the drive sprockets and chain in the foreground]]\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.<ref name=vogel_20>Vogel, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.<ref name=vogel_28>Vogel, p. 28.</ref> Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around {{convert|3.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}} diameter [[sprocket]]s. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.<ref name=vogel_28/>\n\n[[File:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Otis lifts originally fitted in the north and south legs]]\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis Brothers & Company]] submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.<ref name=\"vogel_23-4\">Vogel, pp. 23\u201324.</ref> Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\n\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. [[Motive power]] was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram {{convert|12.67|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|96.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of {{convert|10.83|m|ftin|abbr=on}}: this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a [[block and tackle]] but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\n\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by L\u00e9on Edoux. A pair of {{convert|81|m|ft|abbr=on}} hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway.

Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Engraved names===\n{{Main|List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower}}\n[[File:Les savants de la Tour Eiffel.jpg|thumb|right|Names engraved on the tower]]\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower.

Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the [[cupola]] to anchors on the [[Avenue de Suffren]] and Champ de Mars. These were connected to [[longwave]] transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the [[Paris Observatory]], using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the [[United States Naval Observatory]], which used an aerial in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia.

It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest.<ref>Sanders, Steven M. \"Is egoism morally defensible?\" ''Philosophia''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2\u20133 / July 1988</ref>\nEthical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense.\n\nEthical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[moral obligation|obligation]] to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[Philosophy of self|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and \"the self\" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[Quality of life|well-being]]) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Impartiality|impartial]]): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral \"agent's\") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.\n\nEthical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. [[Individualism]] allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]]. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaimonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], \"Ethical egoism ... endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness.\"<ref name=\"Rachels 2008, p. 534\">Rachels 2008, p. 534.</ref>\n\nEthical egoism is often used as the philosophical basis for support of [[right-libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].<ref name=ridgely>{{Cite web\n | last = Ridgely\n | first = D.A.\n | authorlink =\n | title = Selfishness, Egoism and Altruistic Libertarianism\n | work =\n | publisher =\n | date = August 24, 2008\n | url = http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/08/selfishness-egoism-and-altruistic-libertarianism.html\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145221/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/08/selfishness-egoism-and-altruistic-libertarianism.html\n | dead-url = yes\n | archive-date = December 2, 2008\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> These are political positions based partly on a belief that individuals should not coercively prevent others from exercising freedom of action.\n\n==Forms==\nEthical egoism can be broadly divided into three categories: individual, personal, and universal. An ''individual ethical egoist'' would hold that all people should do whatever benefits \"my\" (''the individual'')'' ''self-interest; a ''personal ethical egoist'' would hold that he or she should act in ''his or her'' self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a ''universal ethical egoist'' would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their self-interest.<ref>Waller (2005), p. 81.</ref><ref>Waller (2005), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==History==\nEthical egoism was introduced by the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.<ref name=\"routledge\">{{Cite book| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter = Egoism and Altruism | last = Floridi | first = Luciano | last2 = Craig | first2 = Edward |publisher = Taylor & Francis | isbn = 9780415187091|pages=246\u201347}}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers before Sidgwick have also retroactively been identified as ethical egoists. One ancient example is the philosophy of [[Yang Zhu]] (4th century BC), [[Yangism]], who views ''wei wo'', or \"everything for myself\", as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.<ref name=\"senghaas\">{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}</ref> Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were exponents of [[virtue ethics]], and \"did not accept the formal principle that whatever the good is, we should seek only our own good, or prefer it to the good of others.\"<ref name=\"routledge\"/> However, the beliefs of the [[Cyrenaics]] have been referred to as a \"form of egoistic hedonism\",<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/cyren/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Cyrenaics]</ref> and while some refer to Epicurus' hedonism as a form of [[virtue ethics]], others argue his ethics are more properly described as ethical egoism.<ref name=\"Evans\">{{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407\u201324 | date = 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Justifications==\nPhilosopher [[James Rachels]], in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favor:<ref>He notes, however, that \"the theory is asserted more often than it is argued for. Many of its supporters apparently think its truth is self-evident, so that arguments are not needed.\" (Rachels 2008, p. 534.)</ref>\n\n*\"The first argument,\" writes Rachels, \"has several variations, each suggesting the same general point:<ref>That is, that regarding and pursuing the interests of others is a self-defeating policy. Rachels quotes Alexander Pope in support of this: \"Thus God and nature formed the general frame/And bade self-love and social be the same.\"</ref>\n**\"Each of us is intimately familiar with our own individual wants and needs. Moreover, each of us is uniquely placed to pursue those wants and needs effectively. At the same time, we know the desires and needs of others only imperfectly, and we are not well situated to pursue them. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if we set out to be 'our brother's keeper,' we would often bungle the job and end up doing more mischief than good.\"<ref name=\"Rachels 2008, p. 534\"/>\n**To give charity to someone is to degrade him, implying as it does that he is reliant on such munificence and quite unable to look out for himself. \"That,\" reckons Rachels, \"is why the recipients of 'charity' are so often resentful rather than appreciative.\"<ref>Rachels 2008, p. 534, where it is pointed out that, in the strictest egoistic terms, this is an inconsequential argument. Ethical egoism does not bother itself with how others receive charity, irrespective of how degraded it makes them feel. The same reasoning applies to the previous two bullets, which use self-interest as a means to the end of beneficence, rather than for its own purposes, as the theory would dictate.</ref>\n*Altruism, ultimately, denies an individual's value and is therefore destructive both to society and its individual components, viewing life merely as a thing to be sacrificed. Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] is quoted as writing that, \"[i]f a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it.\"<ref>Rachels 2008, p. 535, where this argument is attributed to [[Ayn Rand]], \"a writer little heeded by professional philosophers but who nevertheless was enormously popular on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s\".</ref> Moreover, \"[t]he basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification for his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue or value.\" Rather, she writes, \"[t]he purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.\"<ref>Rand, Ayn, \"Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World,\" ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'', p. 74; ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', 1957, Random House, p. 1014; \"Faith and Force,\" p. 74.</ref>\n*All of our commonly accepted moral duties, from doing no harm unto others to speaking always the truth to keeping promises, are rooted in the one fundamental principle of self-interest.\n*It has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Ethical egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: \"If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?\"<ref>Rand, Ayn, ''Atlas Shrugged'', 1957, Random House.</ref> It is therefore altruism which is an arbitrary position, according to Rand.\n\n==Criticism==\nIt has been argued that extreme ethical egoism is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may respond that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in his or her rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics \"Ethics\"] ''Britannica''</ref> However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. A tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest\u2014capitalism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights |journal=[[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=18871899 |date=1998 |issn=0167-4544 |jstor=25074025 }}</ref> More generally, an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear how to apply a private ownership model to many examples of \"Commons\", however.

Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by [[Karl Marx]], and the many other [[materialist]]s who espoused forms of [[collectivism]]. It has been argued that ethical egoism can lend itself to [[individualist anarchism]] such as that of [[Benjamin Tucker]], or the combined [[anarcho-communism]] and egoism of [[Emma Goldman]], both of whom were proponents of many egoist ideas put forward by [[Max Stirner]]. In this context, egoism is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have been less radical, retaining altruism and a sense of the importance of the individual that is appreciable but does not go as far as egoism. Recent trends to greater appreciation of egoism within [[anarchism]] tend to come from less classical directions such as [[post-left anarchy]] or [[Situationism]] (e.g. [[Raoul Vaneigem]]). Egoism has also been referenced by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], such as [[Murray Rothbard]].\n\nPhilosopher [[Max Stirner]], in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, though his writing makes clear that he desired not a new idea of morality (ethical egoism), but rather a rejection of morality ([[amoralism]]), as a nonexistent and limiting \"spook\"; for this, Stirner has been described as the first [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]]. Other philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Gauthier]], have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims\u2014that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of \"[[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]]\" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the ''maximizing'' of one's chances of survival and/or happiness.\n\nPhilosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggested that egoistic or \"life-affirming\" behavior stimulates jealousy or \"[[ressentiment]]\" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in [[Christianity]]. Sociologist [[Helmut Schoeck]] similarly considered [[envy]] the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these.<ref>[[Helmut Schoeck|Schoeck, Helmut]], ''Der Neid. Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft'' (''Envy. A Theory of Social Behaviour''), 1966, 1st English ed. 1969.</ref>  In addition, Nietzsche (in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'') and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (in ''[[After Virtue]]'') have pointed out that the [[ancient Greeks]] did not associate [[morality]] with altruism in the way that post-Christian [[Western culture|Western civilization]] has done.\n[[Aristotle]]'s view is that we have duties to ourselves as well as to other people (e.g. friends) and to the ''[[polis]]'' as a whole. The same is true for [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], who claim that there are duties to ourselves as Aristotle did, although it has been argued that, for Aristotle, the duty to one's self is primary.<ref>Wheeler, Jack, \"Rand and Aristotle,\" in Den Uyl and Rasmussen, ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'', 1986.</ref>\n\n[[Ayn Rand]] argued that there is a positive harmony of interests among free, rational humans, such that no moral agent can rationally coerce another person consistently with his own long-term self-interest. Rand argued that other people are an enormous value to an individual's well-being (through education, trade and affection), but also that this value could be fully realized only under conditions of political and economic freedom. According to Rand, voluntary trade alone can assure that human interaction is ''mutually'' beneficial.<ref>Rand, Ayn, ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964).</ref> Rand's student, [[Leonard Peikoff]] has argued that the identification of one's interests itself is impossible absent the use of principles, and that self-interest cannot be consistently pursued absent a consistent adherence to certain ethical principles.<ref>Peikoff, Leonard, \"Why Should One Act on Principle?,\" ''The Objectivist Forum'', 1988, originally delivered at the [[Ford Hall Forum]].</ref> Recently, Rand's position has also been defended by such writers as [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], [[Tibor Machan]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[David Kelley]], [[Douglas Rasmussen]], [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Andrew Bernstein]], and [[Craig Biddle]].\n\nPhilosopher [[David L. Norton]] identified himself an \"ethical individualist\", and, like Rand, saw a harmony between an individual's fidelity to his own self-actualization, or \"personal destiny\", and the achievement of society's well being.<ref>[[David L. Norton|Norton, David]], ''Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism'', 1976, [[Princeton University Press]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Adam Smith]] and the [[invisible hand]]\n*[[Baruch Spinoza]]\n*[[Epicurus]]\n*[[Thomas Hobbes]]\n*[[Behavioral economics]]\n*[[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]], an egoistic Indian philosophy\n*[[Ethical solipsism]]\n*[[Hedonism]]\n*[[Helping behavior]]\n*[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)]]\n*[[Profit motive]]\n*[[Rational expectations]]\n*[[Yangism]], an egoistic Chinese philosophy\n{{colend}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Aristotle]], ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.\n* [[Aristotle]], ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''.\n* {{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407\u201324 | date = 2004}}\n* [[Kurt Baier|Baier, Kurt]], 1990, \"Egoism\" in ''A Companion to Ethics'', [[Peter Singer]] (ed.), Blackwell: Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-631-18785-1}}\n* Biddle, Craig, ''Loving Life: The Morality of Self-Interest and the Facts that Support It'', 2002, Glen Allen.\n* [[Nathaniel Branden|Branden, Nathaniel]], ''[[The Psychology of Self-Esteem]]'', 1969, Nash.\n* [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes, Thomas]], 1968, ''Leviathan'', [[C.

Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.\n\nIf genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the [[Species problem#Mayr's Biological Species Concept|''Biological Species Concept'']] (BSC).\n\nDuring the development of the modern synthesis, Sewall Wright developed his [[shifting balance theory]], which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |authorlink=Sewall Wright |year=1932 |title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |journal=Proceedings of the VI International Congress of Genetrics |volume=1 |pages=356\u2013366 |accessdate=2014-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063103/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}</ref> However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory.<ref name=\"Coyne 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry A. |authorlink1=Jerry Coyne |last2=Barton |first2=Nicholas H. |last3=Turelli |first3=Michael |date=June 1997 |title=Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution |journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=643\u2013671 |doi=10.2307/2411143 |pmid=28568586 |issn=0014-3820|jstor=2411143 }}</ref>\n\n== Outcomes ==\n[[File:Kishony lab-The Evolution of Bacteria on a Mega-Plate.webm|thumb|upright=1.5|thumbtime=106|A visual demonstration of rapid [[antibiotic resistance]] evolution by ''E. coli'' growing across a plate with increasing concentrations of [[trimethoprim]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baym|first=Michael|last2=Lieberman|first2=Tami D.|last3=Kelsic|first3=Eric D.|last4=Chait|first4=Remy|last5=Gross|first5=Rotem|last6=Yelin|first6=Idan|last7=Kishony|first7=Roy|date=2016-09-09|title=Spatiotemporal microbial evolution on antibiotic landscapes|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/1147|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6304|pages=1147\u20131151|doi=10.1126/science.aag0822|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27609891|pmc=5534434|bibcode=2016Sci...353.1147B|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923173125/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/1147|archivedate=2016-09-23|df=}}</ref>]]\n\nEvolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding [[Predation|predator]]s or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.\n\nThese outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as [[macroevolution]] versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in [[allele frequency]] and adaptation.<ref name=\"ScottEC\">{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new [[habitat]]s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels\u2014with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657\u2013658}}<ref name=\"Gould_1994\">{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=July 19, 1994 |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

He was also a renowned [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]], tropical explorer, [[ornithologist]], [[Philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]], and [[History of science|historian of science]].<ref>Rennie, J. (1994), ''Profile: Ernst Mayr &ndash; Darwin's Current Bulldog'', [[Scientific American]] 271 (2), 24-25.</ref> His work contributed to the conceptual revolution that led to the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]], [[systematics]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[evolution]], and to the development of the [[Species|biological species concept]].\n\nAlthough [[Charles Darwin]] and others posited that multiple [[species]] could evolve from a single [[common ancestor]], the mechanism by which this occurred was not understood, creating the ''[[species problem]]''. Ernst Mayr approached the problem with a new definition for species. In his book ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species]]'' (1942) he wrote that a species is not just a group of [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar individuals, but a group that can [[Breeding in the wild|breed]] only among themselves, excluding all others. When populations within a species become isolated by geography, feeding strategy, [[mate choice]], or other means, they may start to differ from other populations through [[genetic drift]] and [[natural selection]], and over time may evolve into new species. The most significant and rapid genetic reorganization occurs in extremely small populations that have been isolated (as on islands).\n\nHis theory of [[peripatric speciation]] (a more precise form of [[allopatric speciation]] which he advanced), based on his work on birds, is still considered a leading mode of [[speciation]], and was the theoretical underpinning for the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], proposed by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. Mayr is sometimes credited with inventing modern [[philosophy of biology]], particularly the part related to [[evolutionary biology]], which he distinguished from [[physics]] due to its introduction of (natural) history into science.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Ernst Mayr - B\u00fcste - Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde - Berlin.jpg|thumb|Bust of Mayr in the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Berlin's Natural History Museum]]]]\nMayr was the second son of Helene Pusinelli and Dr. Otto Mayr. His father was a jurist (District Prosecuting\nAttorney at [[W\u00fcrzburg]])<ref>Haffer 2007:12</ref> but took an interest in natural history and took the children out on field trips. He learnt all the local birds in W\u00fcrzburg from his elder brother Otto. He also had access to a natural history magazine for amateurs, ''Kosmos''. His father died just before he was thirteen. The family then moved to [[Dresden]] and he studied at the Staatsgymnasium (\"Royal Gymnasium\" until 1918) in Dresden-Neustadt and completed his high school education there. In April 1922, while still in high school, he joined the newly founded Saxony Ornithologists' Association. Here he met Rudolf Zimmermann, who became his ornithological mentor. In February 1923, Mayr passed his high school examination (Abitur) and his mother rewarded him with a pair of binoculars.<ref name = \"skvotb\">Haffer 2007:22</ref>\n\nOn 23 March 1923 on the lakes of [[Moritzburg, Saxony|Moritzburg]], the Frauenteich, he spotted what he identified as a [[red-crested pochard]]. The species had not been seen in Saxony since 1845 and the local club argued about the identity. Raimund Schelcher (1891\u20131979) of the club then suggested that Mayr visit his classmate [[Erwin Stresemann]] on his way to Greifswald, where Mayr was to begin his medical studies.<ref name = \"skvotb\"/> After a tough interrogation, Stresemann accepted and published the sighting as authentic. Stresemann was very impressed and suggested that, between semesters, Mayr could work as a volunteer in the ornithological section of the museum. Mayr wrote about this event, \"It was as if someone had given me the key to heaven.\"<ref name = \"skvotb\"/> He entered the [[University of Greifswald]] in 1923 and, according to Mayr himself, \"took the medical curriculum (to satisfy a family tradition) but after only a year, he decided to leave medicine and enrolled at the Faculty of Biological Sciences.\"<ref name = \"bpdwnh\">Mayr & Provine, 1998:p. 413.</ref> Mayr was endlessly interested in ornithology and \"chose Greifswald at the Baltic for my studies for no other reason than that ... it was situated in the ornithologically most interesting area.\"<ref name = \"bpdwnh\"/> Although he ostensibly planned to become a physician, he was \"first and foremost an ornithologist.\"<ref name = \"bpdwnh\"/> During the first semester break Stresemann gave him a test to identify treecreepers and Mayr was able to identify most of the specimens correctly. Stresemann declared that Mayr \"was a born [[systematist]]\".<ref>Haffer 2007:23.</ref> In 1925, Stresemann suggested that he give up his medical studies, in fact he should leave the faculty of medicine and enrol into the faculty of Biology and then join the Berlin Museum with the prospect of bird-collecting trips to the tropics, on the condition that he completed his doctoral studies in 16 months. Mayr completed his doctorate in ornithology at the [[University of Berlin]] under Dr. Carl Zimmer, who was a full professor (Ordentlicher Professor), on 24 June 1926 at the age of 21. On 1 July he accepted the position offered to him at the museum for a monthly salary of 330.54 Reichsmark.<ref>Haffer 2007:35.</ref>\n\nAt the International Zoological Congress at Budapest in 1927, Mayr was introduced by Stresemann to banker and naturalist [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], who asked him to undertake an expedition to [[New Guinea]] on behalf of himself and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. In New Guinea, Mayr collected several thousand bird skins (he named 26 new bird species during his lifetime) and, in the process also named 38 new [[orchid]] species. During his stay in New Guinea, he was invited to accompany the [[Whitney South Seas Expedition]] to the [[Solomon Islands]]. Also, while in New Guinea, he visited the Lutheran missionaries Otto Thiele and Christian Keyser, in the Finschhafen district; there, while in conversation with his hosts, he uncovered the discrepancies in [[Hermann Detzner]]'s popular book ''Four Years Among the Cannibals in German Guinea from 1914 to the Truce'', in which Detzner claimed to have seen the interior, discovered several species of flora and fauna, while remaining only steps ahead of the Australian patrols sent to capture him.\n\nHe returned to Germany in 1930, and in 1931 he accepted a curatorial position at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where he played the important role of brokering and acquiring the [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] collection of bird skins, which was being sold in order to pay off a blackmailer. During his time at the museum he produced numerous publications on bird taxonomy, and in 1942 his first book ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species]]'', which completed the evolutionary synthesis started by Darwin.\n\nAfter Mayr was appointed at the American Museum of Natural History, he influenced American ornithological research by mentoring young birdwatchers. Mayr was surprised at the differences between American and German birding societies. He noted that the German society was \"far more scientific, far more interested in life histories and breeding bird species, as well as in reports on recent literature.\"<ref name=barrow>Barrow, Mark V. (1998), ''A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-04402-3}}.</ref>\n\nMayr organized a monthly seminar under the auspices of the Linnean Society of New York. Under the influence of J.A. Allen, Frank Chapman, and Jonathan Dwight, the society concentrated on taxonomy and later became a clearing house for bird banding and sight records.<ref name=barrow />\n\nMayr encouraged his Linnaean Society seminar participants to take up a specific research project of their own. Under Mayr's influence one of them, Joseph Hickey, went on to write ''A Guide to Birdwatching'' (1943). Hickey remembered later, \"Mayr was our age and invited on all our field trips. The heckling of this German foreigner was tremendous, but he gave tit for tat, and any modern picture of Dr E. Mayr as a very formal person does not square with my memory of the 1930s. He held his own.\" A group of eight young birdwatchers from [[The Bronx]] later became the Bronx County Bird Club, led by [[Ludlow Griscom]]. \"Everyone should have a problem\" was the way one Bronx County Bird Club member recalled Mayr's refrain.<ref name=barrow />\n\nMayr said of his own involvement with the local birdwatchers: \"In those early years in New York when I was a stranger in a big city, it was the companionship and later friendship which I was offered in the Linnean Society that was the most important thing in my life.\"<ref name=barrow />\n\nMayr also greatly influenced the American ornithologist [[Margaret Morse Nice]]. Mayr encouraged her to correspond with European ornithologists and helped her in her landmark study on [[song sparrow]]s. Nice wrote to [[Joseph Grinnell]] in 1932, trying to get foreign literature reviewed in the ''Condor'': \"Too many American ornithologists have despised the study of the living bird; the magazines and books that deal with the subject abound in careless statements, anthropomorphic interpretations, repetition of ancient errors, and sweeping conclusions from a pitiful array of facts.&nbsp; ... in Europe the study of the living bird is taken seriously. We could learn a great deal from their writing.\" Mayr ensured that Nice could publish her two-volume ''Studies in the Life History of the Song Sparrow''. He found her a publisher, and her book was reviewed by [[Aldo Leopold]], Joseph Grinnell, and [[Jean Delacour]]. Nice dedicated her book to \"My Friend Ernst Mayr.\"<ref name=barrow/>\n\nMayr joined the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1953, where he also served as director of the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] from 1961 to 1970. He retired in 1975 as [[emeritus]] professor of [[zoology]], showered with honors. Following his retirement, he went on to publish more than 200 articles, in a variety of journals\u2014more than some reputable scientists publish in their entire careers; 14 of his 25 books were published after he was 65. Even as a [[centenarian]], he continued to write books. On his 100th birthday, he was interviewed by ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine. Mayr died on 3 February 2005 in his retirement home in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]] after a short illness. His wife, Margarete, died in 1990. He was survived by two daughters, five grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.<ref name=\"SNBC\">{{cite news |title=Evolutionary theorist dies at 100 |date=2005-04-02 |work=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6914624/ }}</ref>\n\nThe awards that Mayr received include the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[Balzan Prize]], the [[George Sarton Medal|Sarton Medal]] of the [[History of Science Society]], the [[International Prize for Biology]], the [[Loye and Alden Miller Research Award]], and the [[Lewis Thomas Prize|Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science]].

(In fact, there is no Nobel Prize for biology.) Mayr did win a 1999 [[Crafoord Prize]]. It honors basic research in fields that do not qualify for Nobel Prizes and is administered by the same organization as the Nobel Prize.\n\nMayr was co-author of six global reviews of [[bird species new to science]] (listed below).\n\nMayr said he was an atheist in regards to \"the idea of a personal God\" because \"there is nothing that supports [it]\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shermer | first1 = M. | last2 = Sulloway | first2 = F.J. | year = 2000 | title = The grand old man of evolution | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/mayr_interview.html | journal = [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 76\u201382 }}</ref>\n\n==Mayr's ideas==\nAs a traditionally trained biologist, Mayr was often highly critical of early mathematical approaches to evolution such as those of [[J.B.S. Haldane]], famously calling such approaches \"beanbag genetics\" in 1959. He maintained that factors such as [[reproductive isolation]] had to be taken into account. In a similar fashion, Mayr was also quite critical of [[molecular evolution]]ary studies such as those of [[Carl Woese]]. Current molecular studies in evolution and speciation indicate that although [[allopatric speciation]] is the norm, there are numerous cases of [[sympatric speciation]] in groups with greater mobility (such as birds). The precise mechanisms of sympatric speciation, however, are usually a form of microallopatry enabled by variations in niche occupancy among individuals within a population.\n\nIn many of his writings, Mayr rejected [[reductionism]] in evolutionary biology, arguing that [[evolutionary pressure]]s act on the whole organism, not on single genes, and that genes can have different effects depending on the other genes present. He advocated a study of the whole [[genome]] rather than of isolated genes only. After articulating the [[biological species concept]] in 1942, Mayr played a central role in the [[Species Problem|species problem]] debate over what was the best [[species concept]]. He staunchly defended the biological species concept against the many definitions of \"species\" that others proposed.\n\nMayr was an outspoken defender of the [[scientific method]], and one known to sharply critique science on the edge. As a notable example, in 1995, he criticized the [[SETI|Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI)]] as conducted by fellow Harvard professor [[Paul Horowitz]] as being a waste of university and student resources, for its inability to address and answer a scientific question.  Over 60 eminent scientists led by [[Carl Sagan]] rebutted the criticism.<ref name=\"Sagan1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Sagan|first1=C.|title=Extraterrestrial Intelligence: An International Petition|journal=Science|volume=218|issue=4571|year=1982|pages=426|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.218.4571.426-a|bibcode = 1982Sci...218..426S|pmid=17808525}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|title=The Abundance of Life-Bearing Planets|journal=Bioastronomy News|date=1995|volume=7|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nMayr rejected the idea of a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and starkly but politely criticized [[Richard Dawkins]]' ideas:\n\n{{quote|The funny thing is if in England, you ask a man in the street who the greatest living Darwinian is, he will say Richard Dawkins. And indeed, Dawkins has done a marvelous job of popularizing Darwinism. But Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian.

In fact, [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]], for instance, worked quite a bit on so-called lethal chromosomes which are highly successful in one combination, and lethal in another. Therefore people like Dawkins in England who still think the gene is the target of selection are evidently wrong. In the 30s and 40s, it was widely accepted that genes were the target of selection, because that was the only way they could be made accessible to [[mathematics]], but now we know that it is really the whole genotype of the individual, not the gene. Except for that slight revision, the basic Darwinian theory hasn't changed in the last 50 years.|Ernst Mayr|Edge<ref name = \"ddrjeu\"/>}}\n\n===Currently recognised taxa named in honour of Ernst Mayr===\n\n* '''[[Bismarck Black Myzomela]]''' - ''[[Myzomela]] psammelaena ernstmayri'' <small>Meise, 1929 </small> <ref name=\"Meise, 1929\">{{cite journal | last1 = Meise | first1 = W.  |year = 1929 | title =Zwei neue Rassen von ''Myzomela nigrita''| journal =Ornithologische Monatsberichte) | volume = 37| pages = 84\u201385}}</ref> - a [[subspecies]] of [[bird]], a [[honeyeater]], [[family (biology)|family]] Meliphagidae, confined to several small islands to the west of the [[Admiralty Islands]], in western [[Oceania]], northeast of New Guinea.\n* '''[[Ernst Mayr's Water Rat]]''' -  ''[[Leptomys]] ernstmayri'' <small>R\u00fcmmler, 1932 </small> <ref name=\"R\u00fcmmler, 1932\">{{cite journal | last1 = R\u00fcmmler | first1 = H. | year = 1932 | title =Ueber die schwimmratten (Hydromyinae), zugleich Beschreibung einer neuen ''Leptomys'' Thos., ''L. ernstmayri'', aus Neuguinea| url = | journal =Aquarium (Berlin) | volume = 1932 | pages = 131\u2013135}}</ref> - a species of [[rodent]], of the family [[Muridae]], from the [[Foja Mountains]] of [[Papua Province]], [[Indonesia]], and [[New Guinea Highlands|Central Cordillera]], [[Adelbert Range]], and [[Huon Peninsula]] of  [[Papua New Guinea]].\n* a [[nematode|roundworm]] - ''Poikilolaimus ernstmayri'' <small>Sudhaus & Koch, 2004 </small> <ref name=\"Sudhaus & Koch, 2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sudhaus | first1 = W. |  last2 = Koch | first2 = C. |year = 2004 | title =The new nematode species ''Poikilolaimus ernstmayri'' sp n. associated with termites, with a discussion on the phylogeny of ''Poikilolaimus'' (Rhabditida)| journal =Russian Journal of Nematology | volume = 12| issue = 2|  pages = 143\u2013156| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299031269}}</ref> - a new species of nematode, [[family (biology)|family]] [[Rhabditidae]], associated with [[termite]]s of the [[genus]] [[Reticulitermes]], on [[Corsica]].\n* '''New Ireland Rail''' - ''[[Gallirallus|Hypotaenidia]] ernstmayri'' [[extinction|\u2020]] <small>(Kirchman & Steadman, 2006) </small> <ref name=\"Kirchman & Steadman, 2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kirchman | first1 = J.J. |  last2 = Steadman | first2 = D.W. |year = 2006 | title =Rails (Rallidae: ''Gallirallus'') from prehistoric archaeological sites in Western Oceania| journal =Zootaxa | volume = 1316| pages = 1\u201331| doi=10.5281/zenodo.173941}}</ref> - a relatively large, probably flightless, extinct [[rail (bird)|rail]], family Rallidae, known from [[subfossil]] remains found on [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[archeology|archeological]] sites, in caves on [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], in the Bismarck Archipelago, western Oceania.

The [[etymology]] reads: The species name ''ernstmayri'' is a [[patronymic|patronym]] honoring the German-American ornithologist, systematist, and evolutionary thinker Ernst Mayr (1904\u20132005). There are several connections linking Ernst Mayr to this new species of ''Toxicocalamus'', which make him, and this snake, the ideal candidates for a patronym. First, Mayr himself visited New Guinea, and during the late 1920s he spent over 2 years conducting fieldwork in an area now part of PNG, as a member of a joint Rothschild\u2013AMNH expedition focusing on [[birds-of-paradise|birds of paradise]] (Aves, Passeriformes, Paradisaeidae), during which he collected many new bird and orchid species. Second, the [[holotype]] of ''T. ernstmayri'' has been housed in the MCZ collection, mislabeled as ''[[Micropechis|Micropechis ikaheka]]'', after having arrived and been accessioned in June 1975, the month and year that Mayr retired. Third, the true identity of this specimen was recognized by one of us (MOS) during a visit to the MCZ in May 2014, undertaken with the financial support of an Ernst Mayr Travel Grant from Harvard University, awarded to enable examination of the ''Toxicocalamus'' holdings at the MCZ and the AMNH, the two U.S. institutions where Mayr worked. Finally, 2015, the publication year of this description, marks the [[anniversary|decennial]] of Mayr's passing at age 100, and naming a New Guinea snake after him seems a suitable tribute.\n* an [[Reduviidae|assassin bug]] - ''[[Bagauda]] ernstmayri'' <small>Kulkarni & Ghate, 2016 </small> <ref name=\"Kulkarni & Ghate, 2016\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kulkarni | first1 = S. |  last2 = Ghate | first2 = H.V. |year = 2016 | title =A new cavernicolous assassin bug of the genus ''Bagauda'' Bergroth (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Emesinae) from the Western Ghats, India| journal =Zootaxa | volume = 4127| issue = 2|  pages = 365\u2013375| doi=10.11646/zootaxa.4127.2.8| pmid = 27395629 }}</ref> - a species of [[cave insect|cavernicolous]], thread-legged assassin bug, known only from [[Satara district|Satara]], in the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Maharashtra]] State, [[India]].\n\n==Mayr's summary of Darwin's theory==\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution is based on key [[fact]]s and the [[inference]]s drawn from them, which Mayr summarised as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=479\u2013480}}</ref>\n\n:* Every [[species]] is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).\n:* Despite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact).\n:* Resources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact).\n:* A struggle for survival ensues (inference).\n:* Individuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact).\n:* Much of this variation is [[heredity|heritable]] (fact).\n:* Individuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of [[natural selection]] (fact).\n:* This slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference).\n\nIn relation to the publication of Darwin's ''Origins of Species'', Erst Mayr identified philosophical implications of evolution:<ref>{{cite book|title=Ideas\u2014A history of thought and invention from fire to Freud|last=Watson|first=Peter|year=2005|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-089287-6|page=641}}</ref>\n:* An evolving world, not a static one.\n:* The implausibility of creationism.\n:* The refutation that the universe has purpose.\n:* Defeating the justifications for a human-centric world.\n:* Materialistic processes explain the impression of design.\n:* Population thinking replaces [[essentialism]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n* {{cite book | last = Mayr | first = Ernst | title = Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1942 | isbn = 978-0-674-86250-0 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Mayr | first = Ernst | title = Birds of the Southwest Pacific: A Field Guide to the Birds of the Area Between Samoa, New Caledonia, and Micronesia | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1945 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Mayr | first = Ernst | title = Animal Species and Evolution | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1963 | isbn = 978-0-674-03750-2 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Mayr | first = Ernst | title = Populations, Species, and Evolution | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1970 | isbn = 978-0-674-69013-4 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Mayr | first = Ernst | title = Evolution and the Diversity of Life | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-674-27105-0 }}\n* Mayr, Ernst. & William B.

Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases.

Around 1.1&nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archivedate=4 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref> Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].\n\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the \"main continent\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].\n\n===Flora===\n\nHaving lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.\n\n[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]\n\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\n\n[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer L\u00f6sch]]\n\nProbably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref> It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2\u20133% or less, in European Russia 5\u201310%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]\u2013[[pine]]\u2013[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{main|Fauna of Europe}}\n[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]\n\nGlaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\n\n[[File:Neandertal - Wisent.jpg|thumb|Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, [[European bison]] now live in nature preserves in [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest]], on the border between [[Poland]] and [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/bison_bonasus.html|title=European bison, Wisent|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226095419/http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/bison_bonasus.html|archivedate=26 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8182000/8182104.stm | work=BBC News | first=Matt | last=Walker | title=European bison on 'genetic brink' | date=4 August 2009}}</ref>]]\n\nEuropean wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\n\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others.

They include a variety of common free-living species, as well as a few important parasites, some of which infect humans. There are two main subgroups, the [[euglenid]]s and [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]]s. Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around [[1 E-5 m|15-40 \u00b5m]] in size, although some euglenids get up to 500&nbsp;\u00b5m long.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euglenozoa |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/~reagle/wp-redux/Euglenozoa/983861847.html|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nMost euglenozoa have two flagella, which are inserted parallel to one another in an apical or subapical pocket. In some these are associated with a [[cytostome]] or mouth, used to ingest [[bacteria]] or other small organisms. This is supported by one of three sets of [[microtubule]]s that arise from the flagellar bases; the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell.<ref name=Pat1999>\n{{cite journal | author = David J. Patterson\n| title = The Diversity of Eukaryotes\n| journal = American Naturalist\n| year = 1999 | volume = 154 | pages = S96\u2013S124 | pmid=10527921 | doi=10.1086/303287 | issue = S4}}\n</ref>\n\nSome other euglenozoa feed through absorption, and many euglenids possess [[chloroplast]]s and so obtain energy through [[photosynthesis]]. These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain [[chlorophyll]]s ''A'' and ''B'', along with other pigments, so are probably derived from a [[endosymbiosis|captured]] [[green alga]].  Reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division.  During [[mitosis]], the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside of it.<ref name=\"Pat1999\"/>\n\nThe group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella.  In addition to the normal supporting microtubules or [[axoneme]], each contains a rod (called ''paraxonemal''), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other.  Based on this, two smaller groups have been included here: the [[diplonemid]]s and ''[[Postgaardi]]''.<ref name=Sim1997>\n{{cite journal | author = Alastair G. B.

They are related to [[Percolozoa]]; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped [[cristae]], which only occurs in a few other groups.<ref name=Bal2000>{{Cite journal | last1 = Baldauf | first1 = S.

Even if these external powers do not exist, we still must depend on only the information provided by our senses and can therefore make no definite statement about anything beyond that information.\n\nSkeptics oppose what they sometimes call dogmatic foundationalism, which states that there must be some basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in [[Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics''.) The skeptical response to this can take several approaches. First, claiming that \"basic positions\" ''must'' exist amounts to the logical fallacy of [[argument from ignorance]] combined with the [[slippery slope]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nAmong other arguments, skeptics used [[Agrippa's trilemma]], named after [[Agrippa the Sceptic]], to claim certain belief could be achieved. [[Foundationalism|Foundationalist]]s have used the same ''trilemma'' argument as justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs.\n\nThis skeptical approach is rarely taken to its pyrrhonean extreme by most practitioners. Several modifications have arisen over the years, including the following [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm#fideism]:\n\n[[Fictionalism]] would not claim to have knowledge but adheres to conclusions on some criterion such as utility, aesthetics, or other personal criteria without claiming that any conclusion is actually \"true\".\n\nPhilosophical fideism (as opposed to religious [[Fideism]]) would assert the truth of some propositions, but does so without asserting certainty.\n\nSome forms of [[pragmatism]] would accept utility as a provisional guide to truth but not necessarily a universal decision-maker.\n\nThere are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as \"mitigated\" and \"unmitigated\" skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still true forms of [[skepticism]].  Mitigated skepticism does not accept \"strong\" or \"strict\" knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones.  These weaker claims can be assigned the title of \"virtual knowledge\", but only to justified beliefs.  Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\">{{cite journal|title=SKEPTICISM|journal=Encyclopedia of Empiricism|year=1997}}</ref>   Characterizing knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person's viewpoint as well as their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>\n\n==Defining knowledge==\nIn mathematics, it is known {{em|that}} 2 + 2 = 4, but there is also knowing {{em|how}} to add two numbers, and knowing a {{em|person}} (e.g., knowing other persons<ref>For example, {{cite journal |last1=Talbert |first1=Bonnie |title=Knowing Other People |journal=Ratio |date=2015 |volume=28 |pages=190-206 |doi=10.1111/rati.12059 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rati.12059}} and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Epistemology Personalized |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=2017 |volume=67 |pages=813-834 |doi=10.1093/pq/pqx020 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/pq/pqx020}}</ref>, or knowing oneself), {{em|place}} (e.g., one's hometown), {{em|thing}} (e.g., cars), or {{em|activity}} (e.g., addition). Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between [[Propositional knowledge|\"knowing that\"]] (know a concept), [[Know-how|\"knowing how\"]] (understand an operation), and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|\"acquaintance-knowledge\"]] (know by relation), with epistemology being primarily concerned with the first of these.<ref>John Bengson (Editor), Marc A. Moffett (Editor): Essays on Knowledge, Mind, and Action. New York: Oxford University Press. 2011</ref>\n\nWhile these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are defined explicitly in other languages (N.B. some languages related to English have been said to retain these verbs, e.g. [[Scots language|Scots]]: {{lang|sco|wit}} and {{lang|sco|[[wikt:ken#Scots|ken]]}}). In French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Dutch 'to know (a person)' is translated using {{lang|fr|conna\u00eetre}}, {{lang|pt|conhecer}}, {{lang|es|conocer}} and {{lang|de|kennen}} (both German and Dutch) respectively, whereas 'to know (how to do something)' is translated using {{lang|fr|savoir}}, {{lang|es|saber}} (both Portuguese and Spanish), {{lang|de|wissen}}, and {{lang|nl|weten}}. Modern Greek has the verbs {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|gnor\u00edzo}}) and {{lang|el|\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|ks\u00e9ro}}). Italian has the verbs {{lang|it|conoscere}} and {{lang|it|sapere}} and the nouns for 'knowledge' are {{lang|it|conoscenza}} and {{lang|it|sapienza}}. German has the verbs {{lang|de|wissen}} and {{lang|de|kennen}}; the former implies knowing a fact, the latter knowing in the sense of being acquainted with and having a working knowledge of; there is also a noun derived from {{lang|de|kennen}}, namely {{lang|de|Erkennen}}, which has been said to imply knowledge in the form of recognition or acknowledgment.<ref>For related linguistic data, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Epistemology Personalized |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=2017 |volume=67 |pages=813-834 |doi=10.1093/pq/pqx020 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/pq/pqx020}}, esp. Section 1.</ref> The verb itself implies a process: you have to go from one state to another, from a state of \"not-{{lang|de|erkennen}}\" to a state of true {{lang|de|erkennen}}. This verb seems the most appropriate in terms of describing the \"episteme\" in one of the modern European languages, hence the German name \"{{lang|de|[[:de:Erkenntnistheorie|Erkenntnistheorie]]}}\". The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.\n\nIn his paper ''On Denoting'' and his later book ''Problems of Philosophy'' [[Bertrand Russell]] stressed the distinction between \"[[knowledge by description]]\" and \"[[knowledge by acquaintance]]\". [[Gilbert Ryle]] is also credited with stressing the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in ''[[The Concept of Mind]].'' In ''Personal Knowledge,'' [[Michael Polanyi]] argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a [[bicycle]], he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the [[physics]] involved in maintaining a state of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Balance|balance]] cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle's, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between knowledge that and knowledge how leads to [[infinite regress]].\n\nIn recent times, epistemologists including [[Ernest Sosa|Sosa]], [[John Greco (philosopher)|Greco]], [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]], [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Zagzebski]] and Duncan Pritchard have argued that epistemology should evaluate people's \"properties\" (i.e., intellectual virtues) and not just the properties of propositions or of propositional mental attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Belief===\n{{Main article|Belief}}\nIn common speech, a \"statement of belief\" is typically an expression of faith or trust in a person, power or other entity\u2014while it includes such traditional views, epistemology is also concerned with what we believe. This includes 'the' truth, and everything else we accept as 'true' for ourselves from a cognitive point of view.\n\n===Truth===\n{{Main article|Truth}}\n{{See also|Criteria of truth}}\nWhether someone's belief is true is not a prerequisite for (its) belief. On the other hand, if something is actually ''known'', then it categorically cannot be false. For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support her, and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under her weight, it could be said that she ''believed'' that the bridge was safe but that her belief was mistaken. It would ''not'' be accurate to say that she ''knew'' that the bridge was safe, because plainly it was not. By contrast, if the bridge actually supported her weight, then the person might say that she had believed the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to herself (by crossing it), she ''knows'' it was safe.\n\nEpistemologists argue over whether belief is the proper [[truth-bearer]]. Some would rather describe knowledge as a system of justified true [[propositions]], and others as a system of justified true sentences. Plato, in his [[Gorgias]], argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm |title=Gorgias |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 October 2008 |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher= |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Justification===\nIn the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Socrates]] considers a number of theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief \"with an account\" (meaning explained or defined in some way). According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have a good reason for doing so. One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true. For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have ''known'' that he would get well since his belief lacked justification.\n\nThe definition of knowledge as justified true belief was widely accepted until the 1960s. At this time, a paper written by the American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]] provoked major widespread discussion. (See [[theory of justification|theories of justification]] for other views on the idea.)\n\n===Gettier problem===\n{{Main article|Gettier problem}}\n[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] representing a definition of knowledge.]]\n[[Edmund Gettier]] is best known for a short paper entitled 'Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?' published in 1963, which called into question the theory of knowledge that had been dominant among philosophers for thousands of years.<ref name=gettier>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Gettier, Edmund\n|year= 1963\n|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\n|jstor=3326922\n|journal = Analysis\n|volume = 23\n|issue=6\n|pages=121\u201323\n|doi = 10.2307/3326922\n}}</ref>  This in turn called into question the actual value of philosophy if such an obvious and easy counterexample to a major theory could exist without anyone noticing it for thousands of years. In a few pages, Gettier argued that there are situations in which one's belief may be justified and true, yet fail to count as knowledge. That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient. As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the \"knowledge\" category (yellow region).\n\nAccording to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met. Gettier proposed two [[thought experiment]]s, which have become known as ''Gettier cases'', as [[counterexample]]s to the classical account of knowledge. One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job. Each man has ten coins in his pocket. Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and, furthermore, knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them). From this Smith infers, \"The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\" However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his own pocket. Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job. While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong. Smith has a justified true belief that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not ''know'' that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket, because Smith's belief is \"...true by virtue of the number of coins in ''Jones's'' pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.\" (see<ref name = gettier/> p.&nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subject's belief is justified, but only happens to be true by virtue of luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (believing that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth\u2014wherein a person's belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without the actual knowledge to base it on.\n\n====Responses to Gettier====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantial attempts to provide a definition of knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition, or proposing a completely new set of conditions, disregarding the classical ones entirely.\n\n=====Infallibilism, indefeasibility=====\nIn one response to Gettier, the American philosopher [[Richard Kirkham]] has argued that the only definition of knowledge that could ever be immune to all counterexamples is the [[infallibilism|infallibilist]] one.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf | title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? | author=Richard L.

In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.\n\nYet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is ''indefeasibility.'' [[Defeasibility]] theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person ''S'' believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to justify the claim that Tom Grabit stole a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, \"Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom.\" When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemologically justified.\n\nThe Indian philosopher [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B. K. Matilal]] has drawn on the [[Navya-Ny\u0101ya]] [[fallibilism]] tradition to respond to the Gettier problem. Nyaya theory distinguishes between ''know p'' and ''know that one knows p''\u2014these are different events, with different causal conditions. The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge ''simpliciter''). The Gettier case is examined by referring to a view of [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] (late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view. The question of justification arises only at the second level, when one considers the knowledgehood of the acquired belief. Initially, there is lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief. But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of ''knowing whether he knows p'', doubts may arise. \"If, in\nsome Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the knowledgehood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be pseudo-evidence), then I am mistaken about the truth of my belief \u2013 and this is in accordance with Nyaya fallibilism: not all knowledge-claims can be sustained.\"<ref name=Matilal>\n{{cite book\n| author =      [[Bimal Krishna Matilal]]\n| title =       Perception: An essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge\n| publisher =   Oxford India 2002\n| year =        1986\n| isbn =      0-19-824625-0\n}} The Gettier problem is dealt with in Chapter 4, ''Knowledge as a mental episode''.

According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if it is produced by a reliable belief-forming process. Examples of reliable processes include: standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning, and introspection.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | editor1-first=G. S.

In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees a number of buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns. While he has seen one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other [[barn]]-like buildings he saw were fa\u00e7ades. Theoretically, Henry does not know that he has seen a barn, despite both his belief that he has seen one being true and his belief being formed on the basis of a reliable process (i.e. his vision), since he only acquired his true belief by accident.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Appearing as Irreducible in Perception |first=Alan H. |last=Goldman |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=37 |issue=2 |date=December 1976 |pages=147\u2013164 |publisher=International Phenomenological Society |jstor=2107188|doi=10.2307/2107188 }}</ref>\n\n=====Other responses=====\n[[Robert Nozick]] has offered the following definition of knowledge:\n''S'' knows that ''P'' if and only if:\n*''P'';\n*''S'' believes that ''P'';\n*if ''P'' were false, ''S'' would not believe that ''P'';\n*if ''P'' were true, ''S'' would believe that ''P''.<ref name=Nozick>\n{{cite book\n| author =      Robert Nozick\n| title =       Philosophical Explanations\n| publisher =   Harvard University Press\n| year =        1981\n| isbn =      0-674-66448-5\n}}[[Philosophical Explanations]] Chapter 3 \"Knowledge and Skepticism\" I.

His belief via the method of the courtroom satisfies the four subjunctive conditions, but his faith-based belief does not. If his daughter were guilty, he would still believe her innocent, on the basis of faith in his daughter; this would violate the third condition.\n\nThe British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized this formulation by suggesting that we do not want to accept as knowledge beliefs, which, while they \"track the truth\" (as Nozick's account requires), are not held for appropriate reasons. He says that \"we do not want to award the title of knowing something to someone who is only meeting the conditions through a defect, flaw, or failure, compared with someone else who is not meeting the conditions.\"<ref name=\"Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Blackburn|first=Simon|title=Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-199-76984-1}}</ref> In addition to this, externalist accounts of knowledge, such as Nozick's, are often forced to reject closure in cases where it is intuitively valid.\n\n[[Timothy Williamson]] has advanced a theory of knowledge according to which knowledge is not justified true belief plus some extra condition(s), but primary. In his book ''[[Knowledge and its Limits]],'' Williamson argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be broken down into a set of other concepts through analysis\u2014instead, it is ''[[sui generis]].'' Thus, according to Williamson, justification, truth, and belief are [[Necessary and sufficient|necessary but not sufficient]] for knowledge.\n\n[[Alvin Goldman]] writes in his \"[[Causal Theory of Knowledge|Causal Theory of Knowing]]\" that knowledge requires a [[Causal chain|causal link]] between the truth of a proposition and the belief in that proposition.\n\n===Externalism and internalism===\n{{Main article|Internalism and externalism}}\nA central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand, and epistemological internalists on the other.\n\nExternalists hold that factors deemed \"external\", meaning outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge, can be conditions of justification. For example, an externalist response to the Gettier problem is to say that for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, there must be a link or dependency between the belief and the state of the external world. Usually this is understood to be a causal link. Such causation, to the extent that it is \"outside\" the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition. Internalists, on the other hand, assert that all knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge.\n\nThough unfamiliar with the internalist/externalist debate himself, many point to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] as an early example of the internalist path to justification. He wrote that, because the only method by which we perceive the external world is through our senses, and that, because the senses are not infallible, we should not consider our concept of knowledge infallible. The only way to find anything that could be described as \"indubitably true\", he advocates, would be to see things \"clearly and distinctly\".<ref name=Regulae>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. I|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28807-1}}</ref> He argued that if there is an omnipotent, good being who made the world, then it's reasonable to believe that people are made with the ability to know. However, this does not mean that man's ability to know is perfect. God gave man the ability to know but not omniscience. Descartes said that man must use his capacities for knowledge correctly and carefully through methodological doubt.<ref name=\"Meditations on First Philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. II|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref> \n\nThe dictum \"Cogito ergo sum\" (I think, therefore I am) is also commonly associated with Descartes' theory. In his own methodological doubt\u2014doubting everything he previously knew so he could start from a blank slate\u2014the first thing that he could not logically bring himself to doubt was his own existence: \"I do not exist\" would be a contradiction in terms. The act of saying that one does not exist assumes that someone must be making the statement in the first place. Descartes could doubt his senses, his body, and the world around him\u2014but he could not deny his own existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist to manifest that doubt. Even if some \"evil genius\" were deceiving him, he would have to exist to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he called his Archimedean point, in order to further develop his foundation for knowledge. Simply put, Descartes' epistemological justification depended on his indubitable belief in his own existence and his clear and distinct knowledge of God.<ref name=Refutations>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\n===Value problem===\nWe generally assume that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If so, what is the explanation? A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in [[Plato]]'s Meno. Socrates points out to Meno that a man who knew the way to Larissa could lead others there correctly. But so, too, could a man who had true beliefs about how to get there, even if he had not gone there or had any knowledge of Larissa. Socrates says that it seems that both knowledge and true opinion can guide action. Meno then wonders why knowledge is valued more than true belief and why knowledge and true belief are different. Socrates responds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief because it is tethered or justified. Justification, or working out the reason for a true belief, locks down true belief.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Plato | first1= |title=Five Dialogues|date=2002|publisher=Hackett Pub. Co. | location=Indianapolis, IN | pages=89\u201390; 97b-98a | isbn=978-0872206335 }}</ref>\n\nThe problem is to identify what (if anything) makes knowledge more valuable than mere true belief, or that makes knowledge more valuable than a more minimal conjunction of its components, such as justification, safety, sensitivity, statistical likelihood, and anti-Gettier conditions, on a particular analysis of knowledge that conceives of knowledge as divided into components (to which knowledge-first epistemological theories, which posit knowledge as fundamental, are notable exceptions).<ref name=\"SEPValue\">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-value/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=The Value of Knowledge|first1=Duncan|last1=Pritchard|first2=John|last2=Turri|accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref> The value problem reemerged in the philosophical literature on epistemology in the twenty-first century following the rise of [[virtue epistemology]] in the 1980s, partly because of the obvious link to the concept of value in ethics.<ref name=\"Pritchard-APQ\">{{Cite journal|title=Recent Work on Epistemic Value|first=Duncan|last=Pritchard|work=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=April 2007|volume=44|number=2|pages=85\u2013110|jstor=20464361}}</ref>\n\nThe value problem has been presented as an argument against epistemic [[reliabilism]] by philosophers including [[Linda Zagzebski]], [[Wayne Riggs]] and [[Richard Swinburne]]. Zagzebski analogizes the value of knowledge to the value of espresso produced by an espresso maker: \"The liquid in this cup is not improved by the fact that it comes from a reliable espresso maker. If the espresso tastes good, it makes no difference if it comes from an unreliable machine.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zagzebski|first1=Linda|title=The Search for the Source of Epistemic Good|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=34|issue=1/2|page=13|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/ZAGTFE.pdf}}</ref> For Zagzebski, the value of knowledge deflates to the value of mere true belief. She assumes that reliability in itself has no value or disvalue, but Goldman and Olsson disagree. They point out that Zagzebski's conclusion rests on the assumption of veritism: all that matters is the acquisition of true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | last2=Olsson| first2=E.

By analogy, having a reliable espresso maker that produced a good cup of espresso would be more valuable than having an unreliable one that luckily produced a good cup because the reliable one would more likely produce good future cups compared to the unreliable one.\n\nThe value problem is important to assessing the adequacy of theories of knowledge that conceive of knowledge as consisting of true belief and other components. According to [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]], an adequate account of knowledge should resist counterexamples and allow an explanation of the value of knowledge over mere true belief. Should a theory of knowledge fail to do so, it would prove inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK; New York | isbn=978-0521037860 | page=5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the more influential responses to the problem is that knowledge is not particularly valuable and is not what ought to be the main focus of epistemology. Instead, epistemologists ought to focus on other mental states, such as understanding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK; New York| isbn=978-0521037860 }}</ref> Advocates of virtue epistemology have argued that the value of knowledge comes from an internal relationship between the knower and the mental state of believing.<ref name=\"SEPValue\" />\n\n==Acquiring knowledge==\n===''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge===\n{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori}}\nThe nature of this distinction has been disputed by various philosophers; however, the terms may be roughly defined as follows:\n*''[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]]'' knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at beforehand, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything that is independent from experience.\n*''[[Empirical evidence|A posteriori]]'' knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).\nA priori knowledge is a way of gaining knowledge without the need of experience.  In Bruce Russell's article \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge\"<ref>Russell, Bruce, \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/apriori/>.</ref> he says that it is \"knowledge based on a priori justification,\" (1) which relies on intuition and the nature of these intuitions.  A priori knowledge is often contrasted with posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge gained by experience.  A way to look at the difference between the two is through an example. Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more.  Option A: All crows are birds.  Option B: All crows are black.  If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird.  If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows therefore knowing they are black.  He goes on to say that it doesn't matter if the statement is true or not, only that if you believe in one or the other that matters.\n\nThe idea of a priori knowledge is that it is based on intuition or rational insights.  Laurence BonJour says in his article \"The Structure of Empirical Knowledge\",<ref>BonJour, Laurence, 1985, The Structure of Empirical Knowledge, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> that a \"rational insight is an immediate, non-inferential grasp, apprehension or 'seeing' that some proposition is necessarily true.\" (3) Going back to the crow example, by Laurence BonJour's definition the reason you would believe in option A is because you have an immediate knowledge that a crow is a bird, without ever experiencing one.\n\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] takes a novel approach to the problem. It says that there is an innate predisposition for certain types of learning. \"Only small parts of the brain resemble a [[tabula rasa]]; this is true even for human beings. The remainder is more like an exposed negative waiting to be dipped into a developer fluid\"<ref>Wilson, E. O., [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1975</ref>\n\n===Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction===\n{{Main article|Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction}}\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', drew a distinction between \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" propositions. He contended that some propositions are such that we can know they are true just by understanding their meaning. For example, consider, \"My father's brother is my uncle.\" We can know it is true solely by virtue of our understanding what its terms mean. Philosophers call such propositions ''analytic\"''. Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, have distinct subjects and predicates. An example would be, \"My father's brother has black hair.\" Kant stated that all mathematical and scientific statements are analytic a priori propositions because they are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] but our knowledge about the attributes of the mathematical or physical subjects we can only get by logical inference.\n\nThe American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in his ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]'', famously challenged the distinction, arguing that the two have a blurry boundary. Some contemporary philosophers have offered more sustainable accounts of the distinction.<ref>Russell, G.: Truth in Virtue of Meaning: A Defence of the Analytic/Synthetic Distinction. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2008</ref>\n\n=== Science as knowledge acquisition ===\n{{Main article|Philosophy of Science}}\n\nScience is viewed as a refined, formalized, systematic, or institutionalized form of the pursuit and acquisition of empirical knowledge. As such, the [[philosophy of science]] may be viewed variously as an application or foundation of the philosophy of knowledge acquisition.\n\n==Regress problem==\n{{Main article|Regress argument}}\n\nThe regress problem is the problem of providing a complete logical foundation for human knowledge. The traditional way of supporting a rational argument is to appeal to other rational arguments, typically using chains of reason and rules of logic. A classic example that goes back to Aristotle is deducing that ''Socrates is mortal.'' We have a logical rule that says ''All humans are mortal'' and an assertion that ''Socrates is human'' and we deduce that ''Socrates is mortal''. In this example how do we know that Socrates is human? Presumably we apply other rules such as:  ''All born from human females are human.'' Which then leaves open the question how do we know that all born from humans are human? This is the regress problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified? As John Pollock stated:\n\n<blockquote>... to justify a belief one must appeal to a further justified belief. This means that one of two things can be the case. Either there are some beliefs that we can be justified for holding, without being able to justify them on the basis of any other belief, or else for each justified belief there is an infinite regress of (potential) justification [the nebula theory]. On this theory there is no rock bottom of justification. Justification just meanders in and out through our network of beliefs, stopping nowhere.<ref name=Pollock>\n{{cite book\n| author =      John L. Pollock\n| title =       Knowledge and Justification\n| publisher =   Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey\n| year =       1975\n| isbn =      0-691-07203-5\n}} p. 26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe apparent impossibility of completing an infinite chain of reasoning is thought by some to support [[skepticism]]. It is also the impetus for Descartes' famous dictum: ''[[I think, therefore I am]]''. Descartes was looking for some logical statement that could be true without appeal to other statements.\n\n===Response to the regress problem===\n\nMany epistemologists studying justification have attempted to argue for various types of chains of reasoning that can escape the regress problem.\n\n*Foundationalism\n[[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] respond to the regress problem by asserting that certain \"foundations\" or \"basic beliefs\" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from other beliefs. These beliefs might be justified because they are self-evident, infallible, or derive from reliable cognitive mechanisms. Perception, memory, and a priori intuition are often considered possible examples of basic beliefs.\n\nThe chief criticism of foundationalism is that if a belief is not supported by other beliefs, accepting it may be arbitrary or unjustified.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=justep-foundational |title=Foundational Theories of Epistemic Justification}}</ref>\n\n*Coherentism\nAnother response to the regress problem is [[coherentism]], which is the rejection of the assumption that the regress proceeds according to a pattern of linear justification. To avoid the charge of circularity, [[coherentism|coherentists]] hold that an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system of which it is a part. This theory has the advantage of avoiding the infinite regress without claiming special, possibly arbitrary status for some particular class of beliefs. Yet, since a system can be coherent while also being wrong, coherentists face the difficulty of ensuring that the whole system [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to reality. Additionally, most logicians agree that any argument that is circular is trivially valid. That is, to be illuminating, arguments must be linear with conclusions that follow from stated premises.\n\nHowever, Warburton writes in 'Thinking from A to Z', \"Circular arguments are not invalid; in other words, from a logical point of view there is nothing intrinsically wrong with them. However, they are, when viciously circular, spectacularly uninformative. (Warburton 1996).\"\n\n*Foundherentism\nA position known as ''[[foundherentism]]'', advanced by [[Susan Haack]], is meant to unify foundationalism and coherentism. One component of this theory is what is called the \"analogy of the crossword puzzle.\" Whereas, for example, infinitists regard the regress of reasons as \"shaped\" like a single line, [[Susan Haack]] has argued that it is more like a crossword puzzle, with multiple lines mutually supporting each other.<ref>{{cite book | title = Evidence and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology |first=Susan|last=Haack |authorlink=Susan Haack| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 1993 | isbn=0-631-19679-X}}</ref>\n\n*Infinitism\nAn alternative resolution to the regress problem is known as \"[[infinitism]]\". Infinitists take the infinite series to be merely potential, in the sense that an individual may have indefinitely many reasons available to them, without having consciously thought through all of these reasons when the need arises. This position is motivated in part by the desire to avoid what is seen as the arbitrariness and circularity of its chief competitors, foundationalism and coherentism.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''epistemology'' is derived from the ancient Greek [[Episteme|''epist\u0113m\u0113'']] meaning \"knowledge\" and the suffix ''-logy'', meaning \"logical [[discourse]]\" (derived from the Greek word ''logos'' meaning \"discourse\"). It is analogue to the German ''Wissenschaftslehre'' (literally, theory of science) which was introduced by philosophers [[Johann Fichte]] and [[Bernard Bolzano]] in the late 18th century. The word first appeared in English in 1847 as a translation of the German in New York's ''Eclectic Magazine'' review of a philosophical novel by German author [[Jean Paul]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |accessdate=21 June 2018 |chapter=Epistemology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = anonymous| title=Jean-Paul Frederich Richter |journal=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science and Art |date=Nov 1847 |volume=12 |page=317 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/iau.31858055206621?urlappend=%3Bseq=339 |accessdate=21 June 2018}}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The title of one of the principal works of Fichte is \u2032Wissenschaftslehre,\u2032 which, after the analogy of ''technology'' ... we render ''epistemology''.}}\n\nIt was properly introduced in the philosophical literature by Scottish philosopher [[James Frederick Ferrier|J.F.

E.g., [[\u00c9mile Meyerson]] opened his ''Identity and Reality'', written in 1908, with the remark that the word 'is becoming current' as equivalent to 'the philosophy of the sciences.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyerson |first1=\u00c9mile |title=Identit\u00e9 et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 |date=1908 |publisher=F.

[[John Locke]] describes his [[An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]] (1689) as an inquiry \"into the original, certainty, and extent of HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, together with the grounds and degrees of BELIEF, OPINION, and ASSENT\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |date=1689 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref>.

For Bachelard, rationalism makes equal reference to all three systems of thinking.\n\n===Constructivism===\n\n[[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]] is a view in philosophy according to which all \"knowledge is a compilation of human-made constructions\",<ref>Raskin, J.

Peirce formulates the maxim: 'Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.'<ref>http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html</ref> This suggests that we are to analyse ideas and objects in the world for their practical value. This is in contrast to any [[correspondence theory of truth]] that holds that what is true is what corresponds to an external reality. William James suggests that through a pragmatist epistemology 'Theories thus become instruments, not answers to enigmas in which we can rest.'<ref>James, W. and Gunn, G. (2000). Pragmatism and other essays. New York: Penguin Books.</ref> A more contemporary understanding of pragmatism was developed by the philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] who proposed that values were historically contingent and dependent upon their utility within a given historical period.<ref>Rorty, R. and Saatkamp, H.

It suggests a more empirical approach to the subject as a whole\u2014leaving behind philosophical definitions and consistency arguments, and instead using psychological methods to study and understand how knowledge actually forms and is used in the natural world.  As such it does not attempt to answer the analytic questions of traditional epistemology but replace them with new empirical ones.\n\n===Indian pramana===\n{{Main article|Pramana}}\n[[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical schools]] such as the Hindu [[Nyaya]], and [[Carvaka]], and later, the [[Jain philosophy|Jain]] and [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophical]] schools, developed an epistemological tradition termed \"pramana\" independently of the Western philosophical tradition. Pramana can be translated as \"instrument of knowledge\" and refers to various means or sources of knowledge that Indian philosophers held to be reliable. Each school of Indian philosophy had their own theories about which pramanas were valid means to knowledge and which were unreliable (and why).<ref>James Lochtefeld, \"Pramana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 520\u2013521</ref> A [[Vedas|Vedic]] text, [[Taittiriya Aranyaka|Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka]] (c. 9th\u20136th centuries BCE), lists \"four means of attaining correct knowledge\": ''sm\u1e5bti'' (\"tradition\" or \"scripture\"), ''pratyak\u1e63a'' (\"perception\"), ''aitihya'' (\"communication by one who is expert\", or \"tradition), and ''anum\u0101na'' (\"reasoning\" or \"inference\").<ref>A.

While the Nyaya school (beginning with the [[Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras]] of Gotama, between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE<ref>Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 129</ref><ref>B.

Skepticism does not refer to any one specific school of philosophy, rather it is a thread that runs through many philosophical discussions of epistemology. The first well known Greek skeptic was [[Socrates]] who claimed that his only knowledge was that he knew nothing with certainty. In Indian philosophy, [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] was a famous skeptic and the Buddhist [[Madhyamika]] school has been seen as taking up a form of skepticism. [[Descartes]]' most famous inquiry into mind and body also began as an exercise in skepticism. Descartes began by questioning the validity of all knowledge and looking for some fact that was irrefutable. In so doing, he came to his famous dictum: [[I think, therefore I am]].\n\n[[Foundationalism]] and the other responses to the regress problem are essentially defenses against skepticism. Similarly, the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]] can be viewed as a [[coherentist]] defense against skepticism. James discarded conventional philosophical views of truth and defined truth as based on how well a concept works in a specific context, rather than objective rational criteria. The philosophy of [[Logical Positivism]] and the work of philosophers such as [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] can be viewed as skepticism applied to what can truly be considered scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Popkin|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Edwards|editor1-first=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volume 7|date=1972|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0028646510|pages=449\u2013461|chapter=Skepticism}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Epistemology|Philosophy}}\n{{outline}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epistemology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Andragogy]]\n*[[Epistemological rupture]]\n*[[Epistemic democracy]]\n*[[Feminist epistemology]]\n*[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]\n*[[Gnosiology]]\n*[[Knowledge]]\n*[[Methodology]]\n*[[Methods of obtaining knowledge]]\n*[[Monopolies of knowledge]]\n*[[Noology|No\u00f6logy]]\n*[[Ontology]]\n*[[Participatory epistemology]]\n*[[Pedagogy]]\n*[[Philosophy of space and time]]\n*[[Reformed epistemology]]\n*[[Scientific method]]\n*[[Self-evidence]]\n*[[Semiotics]]\n*[[Sociology of knowledge]]\n*[[Uncertainty principle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n<!-- Please order books alphabetically by the author's last name -->\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = Annis | first1 = David | year = 1978 | title = A Contextualist Theory of Epistemic Justification | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013219 }}\n*[[Alfred Jules Ayer|Ayer, Alfred Jules]]. 1936.

[[L. L. Zamenhof]], a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] ophthalmologist, created Esperanto in the late 19th century and published the first book detailing it, ''[[Unua Libro]]'', in 1887 under the pseudonym Dr. Esperanto, ''Esperanto'' translating as \"one who hopes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Doktoro Esperanto, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof |url=https://global.britannica.com/biography/L-L-Zamenhof|website=Global Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc}}</ref> Zamenhof's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal [[second language]] to foster peace and international understanding. His original title for the language was simply the '''international language''' (''lingvo internacia''), but early speakers grew fond of the name ''Esperanto'' and began to use it as the name for the language in 1889; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since.<ref>{{harvnb|Schor|p=70}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Zamenhof published ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' as a definitive guide to the language. Later that year, he organized the first [[World Esperanto Congress]], an ongoing annual conference, in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne-sur-Mer, France]]. The first congress ratified the [[Declaration of Boulogne]], which established several foundational premises for the Esperanto movement. One of its pronouncements is that ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' is the only obligatory authority over the language. Another is that the Esperanto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it. Zamenhof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of Esperanto, foreshadowing the founding of the [[Akademio de Esperanto]], in part modeled after the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], which was established soon thereafter. Since 1905, congresses have been held in various countries every year, with the exceptions of years during the World Wars. In 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers led by [[Hector Hodler]] established the [[Universal Esperanto Association]], in order to provide a central organization for the global Esperanto community.\n\nEsperanto grew throughout the 20th century, both as a language and as a linguistic community.

L. Zamenhof published in 1887 in the [[Russian language]]]]\n\nEsperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], a [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] ophthalmologist from [[Bia\u0142ystok]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], but now part of [[Poland]]. He lived on Dzika Street, No. 9. According to Zamenhof, he created the language to reduce the \"time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues\" and to foster harmony between people from different countries: \"Were there but an international language, all translations would be made into it alone&nbsp;... and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood.\"<ref name=\"UnuaLibro\"/> His feelings and the situation in Bia\u0142ystok may be gleaned from an extract from his letter to Nikolai Borovko:<ref>The letter is quoted in [http://www.u-matthias.de/latino/latin_en.htm Esperanto: The New Latin for the Church and for Ecumenism], by Ulrich Matthias. Translation from Esperanto by Mike Leon and Maire Mullarney</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"The place where I was born and spent my childhood gave direction to all my future struggles. In Bia\u0142ystok the inhabitants were divided into four distinct elements: Russians, Poles, Germans and Jews; each of these spoke their own language and looked on all the others as enemies. In such a town a sensitive nature feels more acutely than elsewhere the misery caused by language division and sees at every step that the diversity of languages is the first, or at least the most influential, basis for the separation of the human family into groups of enemies. I was brought up as an idealist; I was taught that all people were brothers, while outside in the street at every step I felt that there were no people, only Russians, Poles, Germans, Jews and so on. This was always a great torment to my infant mind, although many people may smile at such an 'anguish for the world' in a child. Since at that time I thought that 'grown-ups' were omnipotent, so I often said to myself that when I grew up I would certainly destroy this evil.\"|L. L. Zamenhof, in a letter to Nikolai Borovko, ca. 1895}}\n\n{{quote|\"It was invented in 1887 and designed that anyone could learn it in a few short months. Dr. Zamenhof lived on Dzika Street, No.9, which was just around the corner from the street on which we lived. Brother Afrum was so impressed with that idea that he learned Esperanto in a very short time at home from a little book. He then bought many dozens of them and gave them out to relatives, friends, just anyone he could, to support that magnificent idea for he felt that this would be a common bond to promote relationships with fellow men in the world. A group of people had organized and sent letters to the government asking\nto change the name of the street where Dr. Zamenhof lived for many years when he invented Esperanto, from Dzika to Zamenhofa. They were told that a petition with a large amount of signatures would be needed. That took time so they organized demonstrations carrying large posters encouraging people to learn the universal language and to sign the petitions... About the same time, in the middle of the block was marching a huge demonstration of people holding posters reading \"Learn Esperanto\", \"Support the Universal language\", \"Esperanto the language of hope and expectation\", \"Esperanto the bond for international communication\" and so on, and many \"Sign the petitions\". I will never forget that rich-poor, sad-glad parade and among all these people stood two fiery red tramway cars waiting on their opposite lanes and also a few doroszkas with their horses squeezed in between. Such a sight it was. Later a few blocks were changed from Dzika Street to Dr. Zamenhofa Street and a nice monument was erected there with his name and his invention inscribed on it, to honor his memory. |Autobiography of Tema Kipnis, Jewish refugee from Poland}}\n\nAbout his goals Zamenhof wrote that he wants mankind to \"learn and use\", \"en masse\", \"the proposed language as a living one\".<ref name=\"UnuaLibro\"/> The goal for Esperanto to become a general world language was not the only goal of Zamenhof; he also wanted to \"enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality, whether the language be universally accepted or not; in other words, the language is to be directly a means of international communication.\"<ref name=\"UnuaLibro\"/>\n\nAfter some ten years of development, which Zamenhof spent translating literature into Esperanto as well as writing original prose and verse, the [[Unua Libro|first book of Esperanto grammar]] was published in Warsaw on 26 July 1887. The number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades, at first primarily in the Russian Empire and Central Europe, then in other parts of Europe, the Americas, China, and Japan. In the early years, speakers of Esperanto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and periodicals, but in 1905 the first [[World Congress of Esperanto|world congress of Esperanto speakers]] was held in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Since the Second World War, they have been attended by an average of more than 2000 people and up to 6000 people.\n\nZamenhof's name for the language was simply {{lang|eo|Internacia Lingvo}} (\"International Language\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-buch?apm=0&aid=100059&teil=0101&seite=00000001&zoom=2 |title=Dr. Esperanto' International Language |publisher=L.

There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.\n\nHowever, neither Belgium nor Prussia (now within Germany) had ever surrendered its original claim to it. Around 1900, Germany in particular was taking a more aggressive stance towards the territory and was accused of sabotage and of obstructing the administrative process in order to force the issue. It was the First World War, however, that was the catalyst that brought about the end of neutrality. On 4 August 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, leaving Moresnet at first \"an oasis in a desert of destruction\".<ref>Musgrave, George Clarke. ''Under Four Flags for France'', 1918, p. 8</ref> In 1915, the territory was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, without international recognition.\n\nAfter the Great War, a great opportunity seemed to arise for Esperanto when the [[Iran]]ian delegation to the [[League of Nations]] proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations, following a report by [[Nitobe Inaz\u014d]], an official delegate of the League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague.<ref>http://www.esperanto.ie/en/zaft/zaft_2.html</ref> Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]]. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision. However, two years later, the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. For this reason, many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement. [[Anarchism]] as a political movement was very supportive during this time of [[anationalism]] as well as of the Esperanto language.<ref>{{lang|eo|\"Anarkiistoj estis inter la pioniroj de la disvastigo de Esperanto.

It includes six [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] with [[diacritic]]s: [[\u0109]], [[\u011d]], [[\u0125]], [[\u0135]], [[\u015d]] (with [[circumflex]]), and [[\u016d]] (with [[breve]]). The alphabet does not include the letters ''q, w, x,'' or ''y'', which are only used when writing unassimilated foreign terms or proper names.\n\nThe 28-letter alphabet is:\n<span style=\"font-size:125%;line-height:150%;\"><center>'''{{lang|eo|a b c \u0109 d e f g \u011d h \u0125 i j \u0135 k l m n o p r s \u015d t u \u016d v z}}'''</center></span>\n\nAll unaccented letters are pronounced approximately as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], with the exception of ''c''. Esperanto ''j'' and ''c'' are used in a way familiar to speakers of many European languages, but which is largely unfamiliar to English speakers: ''j'' has a ''y'' sound [j~i\u032f], as in '''''y'''ellow'' and ''bo'''y''','' and ''c'' has a ''ts'' sound [t\u0361s], as in ''hi'''ts''''' or the ''zz'' in ''pi'''zz'''a''.<ref>These letters occasionally have these values in English as well, for example the ''j'' in ''[[hallelujah|hallelu'''j'''ah]], [[Jarlsberg cheese|'''J'''arlsberg]],'' or ''[[J\u00e4germeister|'''J'''\u00e4germeister]]'', and the ''c'' in the name of composer ''[[Krzysztof Penderecki|Pendere'''c'''ki]]'', Czech president ''[[V\u00e1clav Havel|V\u00e1'''c'''lav Havel]]'', or the mineral ''[[letovicite]]''.</ref> The accented letters are a bit like ''h''-digraphs in English: ''\u0108'' is pronounced like English ''ch'', and ''\u015d'' like ''sh''. ''\u011c'' is the ''g'' in '''''g'''em'', ''\u0135'' a ''zh'' sound, as in ''fu'''s'''ion'' or French '''''J'''acques'', and the rare ''\u0125'' is like the German {{lang|de|Ba'''ch'''}}, Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Scottish Standard English ''lo'''ch''''', or how [[Scouse]] people sometimes pronounce the 'k' in ''boo'''k''''' and 'ck' in ''chi'''ck'''en''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, created an \"h-convention\", which replaces ''\u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d,'' and ''\u016d'' with ''ch, gh, hh, jh, sh,'' and ''u,'' respectively. If used in a database, a program in principle could not determine whether to render, for example, ''ch'' as ''c'' followed by ''h'' or as ''\u0109'', and would fail to render, for example, the word {{lang|eo|[[wikt:senchava|senchava]]}} properly. A more recent \"[[x-convention]]\" has gained ground since the advent of computing. This system replaces each diacritic with an ''x'' (not part of the Esperanto alphabet) after the letter, producing the six digraphs ''cx, gx, hx, jx, sx,'' and ''ux.''\n\nThere are computer [[keyboard layouts]] that support the Esperanto alphabet, and some systems use software that automatically replaces x- or h-convention digraphs with the corresponding diacritic letters (for example, {{lang|eo|Amiketo}}<ref>Amiketo and Tajpi are keyboard layouts which support the Esperanto alphabet for [http://www012.upp.so-net.ne.jp/klivo/amiketo/ Windows], [http://www012.upp.so-net.ne.jp/klivo/amiketo/makamiketo.html Mac OS X], and [http://www012.upp.so-net.ne.jp/klivo/amiketo/linamiketo.html Linux]</ref> for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]], {{lang|eo|Esperanta Klavaro}} for [[Windows Phone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/esperanta-klavaro/e2264bb4-b596-4fb2-a5d3-42d007d6b53c|title=Esperanta Klavaro|work=windowsphone.com}}</ref> and [[Gboard]] and [[AnySoftKeyboard]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]).\n\nCriticisms are made of the letters with circumflex diacritics, which some find odd or cumbersome, along with their being invented specifically for Esperanto rather than borrowed from existing languages; as well as being arguably unnecessary, as for example with the use of ''\u0125'' instead of ''x'' and ''\u016d'' instead of ''w''.<ref name=\"critiche\">{{cite web|url=http://parracomumangi.altervista.org/domande.htm |title=Critiche all'esperanto ed alle altre lingue internazionali |publisher=Parracomumangi.altervista.org |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe [[phonology]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], and [[semantics]] are based on the [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in Europe. The [[phoneme|sound inventory]] is essentially [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], as is much of the semantics, whereas the vocabulary derives primarily from the [[Romance languages]], with a lesser contribution from [[Germanic languages]] and minor contributions from Slavic languages and Greek. [[Pragmatics]] and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early authors, primarily Russian, Polish, German, and French.

Adjectives can be freely placed before or after the nouns they modify, though placing them before the noun is more common. New words are formed through extensive [[prefix]]ing and [[suffix]]ing.\n\n=== Grammar ===\n{{Main article|Esperanto grammar}}\nEsperanto words are mostly [[Morphological derivation|derived]] by stringing together [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], grammatical endings, and at times [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es. This process is regular, so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood. [[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]] words are formed with a modifier-first, [[head (linguistics)|head-final]] order, as in English (compare \"birdsong\" and \"songbird,\" and likewise, {{lang|eo|birdokanto}} and {{lang|eo|kantobirdo}}). Speakers may optionally insert an ''o'' between the words in a compound noun if placing them together directly without the ''o'' would make the resulting word hard to say or understand.\n\nThe different [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] are marked by their own suffixes: all [[common noun]]s end in {{lang|eo|-o}}, all [[adjective]]s in {{lang|eo|-a}}, all derived adverbs in {{lang|eo|-e}}, and all [[verb]]s end in {{lang|eo|-s}}, specifically in one of six [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] suffixes, such as the [[present tense]] {{lang|eo|-as}}. Nouns and adjectives have two cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]] for grammatical subjects and in general, and [[Accusative case|accusative]] for direct objects and (after a preposition) to indicate direction of movement.\n\n[[Grammatical number|Singular]] nouns used as [[grammatical subject]]s end in {{lang|eo|-o}}, [[Grammatical number|plural]] subject nouns in {{lang|eo|-oj}} (pronounced [oi\u032f] like English \"oy\"). Singular [[direct object]] forms end in {{lang|eo|-on}}, and plural direct objects with the combination {{lang|eo|-ojn}} ([oi\u032fn]; rhymes with \"coin\"): {{lang|eo|-o-}} indicates that the word is a noun, {{lang|eo|-j-}} indicates the plural, and {{lang|eo|-n}} indicates the [[accusative case|accusative]] (direct object) case. Adjectives [[Grammatical number#Adjectives and determiners|agree]] with their nouns; their endings are singular subject {{lang|eo|-a}} ([a]; rhymes with \"ha!\"), plural subject {{lang|eo|-aj}} ([ai\u032f], pronounced \"eye\"), singular object {{lang|eo|-an}}, and plural object {{lang|eo|-ajn}} ([ai\u032fn]; rhymes with \"fine\").\n\n{| style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n!

They are [[present tense]] {{lang|eo|-as}}, [[future tense]] {{lang|eo|-os}}, [[past tense]] {{lang|eo|-is}}, [[infinitive]] mood {{lang|eo|-i}}, [[conditional mood]] {{lang|eo|-us}} and [[jussive mood]] {{lang|eo|-u}} (used for wishes and commands). Verbs are not marked for person or number. Thus, {{lang|eo|kanti}} means \"to sing\", {{lang|eo|mi kantas}} means \"I sing\", {{lang|eo|vi kantas}} means \"you sing\", and {{lang|eo|ili kantas}} means \"they sing\".\n\n{| style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n!

Adjectives may precede or follow nouns; subjects, verbs and objects may occur in any order. However, the [[article (grammar)|article]] {{lang|eo|la}} \"the\", [[demonstrative]]s such as {{lang|eo|tiu}} \"that\" and [[preposition]]s (such as {{lang|eo|\u0109e}} \"at\") must come before their related nouns. Similarly, the negative {{lang|eo|ne}} \"not\" and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] such as {{lang|eo|kaj}} \"and\" and {{lang|eo|ke}} \"that\" must precede the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] that they introduce. In [[copula (linguistics)|copular]] (A = B) clauses, word order is just as important as in English: \"people are animals\" is distinguished from \"animals are people\".\n\n=== Living language ===\nThe [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] has found that Esperanto fulfills all the requirements of a [[living language]].<ref>''{{lang|eo|La\u016d la komuna opinio de gvidaj fakuloj de la Instituto, Esperanto apartenas al la kategorio de vivaj lingvoj.

The vocabulary, for example, draws about two-thirds from [[Romance languages|Romance]] and one-third from [[Germanic languages]]; the [[syntax]] is Romance; and the phonology and semantics are [[Slavic languages|Slavic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The [[grammar]] is arguably more European than not, but Claude Piron among others argues that the derivation system is not particularly European, though the inflection is.<ref>''Le Defi des Langues'' by Claude Piron.

In addition, nouns that denote persons and whose definitions are not explicitly male are often assumed to be male unless explicitly made female, such as ''doktoro,'' a PhD doctor (male or unspecified) versus ''doktorino,'' a female PhD. This is analogous to the situation with the English suffix ''-ess,'' as in the words ''baron/baroness'', ''waiter/waitress'', etc. Esperanto pronouns are similar. As in English, ''li'' \"he\" may be used generically, whereas ''\u015di'' \"she\" is always female.<ref>Kalocsay & Waringhien, ''Plena analiza gramatiko'' (1985:73)</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n{{Main article|Esperanto phonology}}\n\nEsperanto has 23 consonants, five vowels, and two [[semivowel]]s that combine with the vowels to form six [[diphthong]]s. (The consonant {{IPA|/j/}} and semivowel {{IPA|/i\u032f/}} are both written ''j'', and the uncommon consonant {{IPA|/dz/}} is written with the digraph ''[[Dz (digraph)|dz]]'',<ref>Kalocsay & Waringhien (1985) {{lang|eo|Plena analiza gramatiko de Esperanto}}, \u00a7&nbsp;17, 22</ref> which is the only consonant that doesn't have its own letter.) [[tone (linguistics)|Tone]] is not used to distinguish meanings of words. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is always on the second-last vowel in fully Esperanto words unless a final vowel {{lang|eo|o}} is elided, which occurs mostly in poetry. For example, ''{{wikteo|familio}}'' \"family\" is {{IPA|[fa.mi.\u02c8li.o]}}, with the stress on the second ''i'', but when the word is used without the final ''{{lang|eo|o}} ({{lang|eo|famili\u2019}}),'' the stress remains on the second {{lang|eo|i}}: {{IPA|[fa.mi.\u02c8li]}}.\n\n==== Consonants ====\nThe 23 consonants are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Labiodental consonant|Labio-<br />dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br />alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA link|m}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA link|n}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[stop consonant|Stop]]\n| {{IPA link|p}} || {{IPA link|b}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|t}} || {{IPA link|d}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|k}} || {{IPA link|\u0261}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361s}} || \n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0283}} || {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0292}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|f}} || {{IPA link|v}}\n| {{IPA link|s}} || {{IPA link|z}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0283}} || {{IPA link|\u0292}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|x}} || &nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|h}} || &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | {{IPA link|r}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA link|l}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA link|j}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n|}\n\nThe sound {{IPAslink|r}} is usually an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPAblink|r}}, but can also be a [[uvular trill]] {{IPAblink|\u0280}}<ref>{{cite web|title=PMEG - Bazaj elparolaj reguloj - Konsonanta variado|url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/skribo_elparolo/elparolo/bazaj_reguloj.html#i-7fo|website=PMEG}}</ref>, a [[Voiced uvular fricative|uvular fricative]] {{IPAblink|\u0281}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Fundamento de Esperanto - Gramatiko Franca|url=http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_franca.html|website=Akademio de Esperanto}}</ref>, and an [[Alveolar and postalveolar approximants|alveolar approximant]] {{IPAblink|\u0279}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Fundamento de Esperanto - Gramatiko Angla|url=http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html|website=Akademio de Esperanto}}</ref>. Many other forms such an [[alveolar tap]] {{IPAblink|\u027e}} are done and accepted in practice. The {{IPAslink|v}} is normally pronounced like English ''v,'' but may be pronounced {{IPAblink|\u028b}} (between English ''v'' and ''w'') or {{IPAblink|w}}, depending on the language background of the speaker. A semivowel {{IPA|/u\u032f/}} normally occurs only in [[diphthong]]s after the vowels {{IPAslink|a}} and {{IPAslink|e\u031e|e}}, not as a consonant {{IPA|/w/}}. Common, if debated, [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] includes the pronunciation of {{lang|eo|nk}} as {{IPA|[\u014bk]}} and {{lang|eo|kz}} as {{IPA|[\u0261z]}}.\n\nA large number of consonant clusters can occur, up to three in initial position (as in ''{{wikteo|stranga}}'', \"strange\") and four in medial position (as in ''{{wikteo|instrui}}'', \"teach\"). Final clusters are uncommon except in foreign names, poetic elision of final ''{{wikteo|o}},'' and a very few basic words such as ''{{wikteo|cent}}'' \"hundred\" and ''{{wikteo|post}}'' \"after\".\n\n==== Vowels ====\nEsperanto has the five vowels found in such languages as <!--Not Italian: Italian has seven vowels.-->[[Classical Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Modern Hebrew]], and [[Modern Greek]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;\"\n!\n! | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: right;\" | [[Close vowel|Close]]\n| <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">{{IPA link|i}}</span>\n| <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">{{IPA link|u}}</span>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: right;\" | [[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n| <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">{{IPA link|e\u031e|e}}</span>\n| <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">{{IPA link|o\u031e|o}}</span>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: right;\" | [[Open vowel|Open]]\n| colspan=2 | <span style=\"font-size:125%;\">{{IPA link|\u00e4|a}}</span>\n|}\n\nThere are also two semivowels, {{IPA|/i\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/u\u032f/}}, which combine with the monophthongs to form six falling [[diphthongs]]: ''{{lang|eo|aj}}, {{lang|eo|ej}}, {{lang|eo|oj}}, {{lang|eo|uj}}, {{lang|eo|a\u016d}},'' and {{lang|eo|e\u016d}}.\n\nSince there are only five vowels, a good deal of variation in pronunciation is tolerated. For instance, ''e'' commonly ranges from {{IPA|[e]}} (French {{lang|fr|\u00e9}}) to {{IPA|[\u025b]}} (French {{lang|fr|\u00e8}}). These details often depend on the speaker's native language. A [[glottal stop]] may occur between adjacent vowels in some people's speech, especially when the two vowels are the same, as in ''{{wikteo|heroo}}'' \"hero\" ({{IPA|[he.\u02c8ro.o]}} or {{IPA|[he.\u02c8ro.\u0294o]}}) and ''{{wikteo|praavo}}'' \"great-grandfather\" ({{IPA|[pra.\u02c8a.vo]}} or {{IPA|[pra.\u02c8\u0294a.vo]}}).\n\n=== Sample text ===\n{{Listen|filename=Eo-drako-re\u011do.ogg|title=Listen to this excerpt}}\nThe following short extract gives an idea of the character of Esperanto.<ref>Maire Mullarney ''Everyone's Own Language'', p147, Nitobe Press, Channel Islands, 1999</ref> (Pronunciation is covered above; the Esperanto letter ''j'' is pronounced like English ''y''.)\n* Esperanto:\n:\u00ab{{lang|eo|En multaj lokoj de \u0108inio estis temploj de la drako-re\u011do.

This book listed 900 roots; these could be expanded into tens of thousands of words using prefixes, suffixes, and compounding. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto [[dictionary]], {{lang|eo|Universala Vortaro}}, which had a larger set of roots. The rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed; it was recommended, however, that speakers use most international forms and then derive related meanings from these.\n\nSince then, many words have been borrowed, primarily (but not solely) from the European languages. Not all proposed borrowings become widespread, but many do, especially [[technical terminology|technical]] and [[science|scientific]] terms. Terms for everyday use, on the other hand, are more likely to be derived from existing roots; {{lang|eo|komputilo}} \"computer\", for instance, is formed from the verb {{lang|eo|komputi}} \"compute\" and the suffix {{lang|eo|-ilo}} \"tool\". Words are also [[calque]]d; that is, words acquire new meanings based on usage in other languages. For example, the word {{lang|eo|muso}} \"mouse\" has acquired the meaning of a [[mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] from its usage in English. Esperanto speakers often debate about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether meaning can be expressed by deriving from or extending the meaning of existing words.\n\nSome compounds and formed words in Esperanto are not entirely straightforward; for example, {{lang|eo|eldoni}}, literally \"give out\", means \"publish\", paralleling the usage of certain European languages (such as [[German (language)|German]]). In addition, [[Esperanto words with the ad hoc suffix -um|the suffix ''-um-'']] has no defined meaning; words using the suffix must be learned separately (such as {{lang|eo|dekstren}} \"to the right\" and {{lang|eo|dekstrumen}} \"clockwise\").\n\nThere are not many idiomatic or [[slang]] words in Esperanto, as these forms of speech tend to make international communication difficult\u2014working against Esperanto's main goal.\n\nInstead of derivations of Esperanto roots, new roots are taken from European languages in the endeavor to create an international language.<ref name=\"piron1989\">{{lang|eo|La Bona Lingvo}}, [[Claude Piron]].

He concludes that Esperanto tends to be more popular in countries that are rich, with widespread Internet access and that tend to contribute more to science and culture. Linguistic diversity within a country was found to have a slight inverse correlation with Esperanto popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svendvnielsen.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/explaining-the-density-of-esperanto-speakers-with-language-and-politics/|title=Explaining the density of Esperanto speakers with language and politics|author=Svend Vendelbo Nielsen|publisher=Kalkulinda|date=September 24, 2017|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Number of speakers ====\nAn estimate of the number of Esperanto speakers was made by [[Sidney S. Culbert]], a retired [[psychology]] professor at the [[University of Washington]] and a longtime Esperantist, who tracked down and tested Esperanto speakers in sample areas in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years. Culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak Esperanto at [[ILR or Foreign Service Level language ability measures|Foreign Service Level 3]], \"professionally proficient\" (able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation, and to follow speeches, radio broadcasts, etc.).<ref name=Culbert>Culbert, Sidney S. [http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/ Three letters about his method for estimating the number of Esperanto speakers], scanned and HTMLized by David Wolff</ref> Culbert's estimate was not made for Esperanto alone, but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers, published annually in the [[World Almanac]] and Book of Facts. Culbert's most detailed account of his methodology is found in a 1989 letter to David Wolff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/culbert-methods.html |title=Number of Esperantists (methods) |publisher=Panix.com |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Since Culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions, it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results.\n\nIn the Almanac, his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as two million. This latter figure appears in ''[[Ethnologue]]''. Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world's population speak the language. Although it is not Zamenhof's goal of a [[international auxiliary language|universal language]], it still represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language.\n\nMarcus Sikosek (now [[Ziko van Dijk]]) has challenged this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. He estimated that even if Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of [[Cologne, Germany|Cologne]]. Van Dijk finds only 30 [[fluency|fluent]] speakers in that city, and similarly smaller-than-expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.<ref name=Sikosek_2003 />\n\n[[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Jouko Lindstedt]], an expert on native-born Esperanto speakers, presented the following scheme<ref name=Lindstedt_1996>Lindstedt, Jouko. \"Re: {{lang|eo|Kiom?}}\" (posting).

This number, however, was disputed by statistician Sten Johansson, who questioned the reliability of the source data and highlighted a wide margin of error, the latter point with which Nielsen agrees.

[[David Gaines (composer)|David Gaines]] used Esperanto poems as well as an excerpt from a speech by Dr. Zamenhof for his ''Symphony No. One (Esperanto)'' for mezzo-soprano and orchestra (1994\u201398).

Typically, this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going to the trouble of inventing a new language. The [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) showed [[Warsaw ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] shop signs in Esperanto. Two full-length [[feature film]]s have been produced with [[dialogue]] entirely in Esperanto: ''{{lang|eo|[[Angoroj]]}},'' in 1964, and ''[[Incubus (1965 film)|Incubus]],'' a 1965 [[B-movie]] horror film which is also notable for starring [[William Shatner]] shortly before he began working on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.\n\nA language school teaching \"Entrenationo\" (representing a satire on Esperanto) is featured in Graham Greene's novel ''[[The Confidential Agent]]'', which was made [[Confidential Agent|into a film]] starring Charles Boyer and Lauren Bacall (1945). Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatization of the novel {{lang|eo|Gerda Malaperis}} (Gerda Has Disappeared). In ''Stamboul Train'', Greene used Esperanto as the language on signs at the main train station in Budapest. A number of mainstream films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way.\n\nEsperanto is used as the universal language in the far future of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Stainless Steel Rat]]'' and ''[[Deathworld]]'' stories. [[Poul Anderson]]'s story \"[[High Treason (Anderson story)|High Treason]]\" takes place in a future where Earth became united politically but was still divided into many languages and cultures, and Esperanto became the language of its space armed forces, fighting wars with various extraterrestrial races. Esperanto is said to be the official language of all the peoples of Phillip Jose Farmer's \"Riverworld\" series.\n\nThe opening song to the popular video game ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', \"{{lang|eo|Memoro de la \u015ctono}}\", was written in Esperanto. It was the first game in the series that was played online, and would have players from both Japan and North America (official European support was added after the North American launch) playing together on the same servers, using an auto-translate tool to communicate. The composer, [[Nobuo Uematsu]], felt that Esperanto was a good language to symbolize worldwide unity.\n\nIn the geek fiction novel ''Off to Be the Wizard'', Esperanto is programmed as the language that triggers all of the wizard's spells. A teacher explains that this is because \"no one really speaks Esperanto and it's easy to learn\".\n\nEsperanto is found in the [[Image Comics]] series ''[[Saga (comics)|Saga]]'' as the language Blue, spoken by the horned inhabitants of Wreath. It is rendered in blue-colored text. Blue is generally only spoken by inhabitants of Wreath, while most other cultures use a universal language that appears to be simply named \"Language.\" Some Wreath inhabitants use translator rings to communicate with those who don't speak Blue. Magic seems to be activated via the linguistic medium of Blue.\n\nIn the television show ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', which begins in the late 22nd century, crewman [[Arnold Rimmer]] constantly spends his time trying to learn Esperanto and failing, even compared to his bunkmate [[Dave Lister (Red Dwarf)|Dave Lister]] who only maintains a casual interest. Additionally many of the signs around the ship ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]'' are written in both English and Esperanto. The novel ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' states that, although not required, it is widely expected that officers in the Space Corps be fluent in the language, hence Rimmer's interest.\n\nEsperanto is available in the language selection in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]''.<ref>[https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft Minecraft - Translation Project on Crowdin].

Esperanto was to serve as an international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages. This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers in the early decades of the movement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations.<ref name=\"EspMov181\" />\n\nEsperanto speakers who want to see Esperanto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called {{lang|eo|[[Finvenkismo|finvenkistoj]]}}, from {{lang|eo|fina venko}}, meaning \"final victory\".<ref name=\"Feeney1999\">{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/405278671.html |title=Esperanto: A surprising 2&nbsp;million speakers worldwide get their words\u2019 worth; from the \u2018planned language\u2019 created in the 19th&nbsp;century |work=The Boston Globe |date=1999-05-12 |page=F01 |first=Mark |last=Feeney |author-link=Mark Feeney |issn=0743-1791 |subscription=yes |quote=Esperantists speak of the ''fina&nbsp;venko'', or \u2018final&nbsp;victory\u2019.

The second aims to act from above (\"desupre\"), beginning with politicians.

More recently, language-learning apps like [[Duolingo]] and [[Amikumu]] have helped to increase the amount of fluent speakers of Esperanto, and find others in their area to speak the language with. As of May 2018, there were 1.32 million students of Esperanto on Duolingo.

It was proposed to Zamenhof by [[Ireland|Irishman]] [[Richard H. Geoghegan|Richard Geoghegan]], author of the first Esperanto textbook for English speakers, in 1887. The flag was approved in 1905 by delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer. A version with an \"{{lang|eo|E}}\" superimposed over the green star is sometimes seen.

The most popular of these is the [[Europe\u2013Democracy\u2013Esperanto]], which aims to establish Esperanto as the [[official language]] of the [[European Union]]. Grin's Report, published in 2005 by [[Fran\u00e7ois Grin]], found that the use of English as the [[lingua franca]] within the European Union costs billions annually and significantly benefits English-speaking countries financially. The report considered a scenario where Esperanto would be the lingua franca, and found that it would have many advantages, particularly economically speaking, as well as ideologically.\n\nRussian Esperanto writer [[Nikolai Vladimirovich Nekrasov|Nikolai Nekrasov]] was arrested during the [[Great Purge|Stalinist repressions]] of the late 1930s, accused of being \"an organizer and leader of a fascist, espionage, terrorist organization of Esperantists\", and executed on 4 October 1938. Another Esperanto writer [[Vladimir Varankin]] was executed on 3 October 1938.\n\n=== Religion ===\nEsperanto has served an important role in several religions, such as [[Oomoto]] from Japan and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] from [[Iran]], and has been encouraged by others, like some [[Spiritist]] movements.\n\n==== Oomoto ====\nThe [[Oomoto]] religion encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers and includes Zamenhof as one of its deified spirits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oomoto.or.jp/Esperanto/index-es.html |title=The Oomoto Esperanto portal |publisher=Oomoto.or.jp |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ====\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] encourages the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and auxiliary language|use of an auxiliary international language]].

All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and become a part of the curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages\u2014one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations.

The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]\n\nIn the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.\n\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\n\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n\nA general methodology and [[epistemology]] of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.<ref>Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}.</ref> Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.\n\nAccording to Billy Vaughn Koen, the \"''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources.\" Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces, but rather how he goes about it.<ref name=\"Discussion of The Method\">{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-515599-0|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]\nEngineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.\n\nUsually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of \"[[level of invention|low-level]]\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.\n\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.\n\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.{{Citation needed|reason=Kindly provide citation. Usually safety factor is considered to be a part of an efficient design.|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.\n\n===Computer use===\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]\n\nAs with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.\n\nOne of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.<ref>\n {{cite web\n  | last = Arbe\n  | first = Katrina\n  | title = PDM: Not Just for the Big Boys Anymore\n  | publisher = ThomasNet\n  | date = 2001-05-07\n  | url = http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2001/05/pdm_not_just_fo.html\n  | accessdate = 2006-12-30\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.\n\nIn recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).<ref>\n {{cite web\n  | last = Arbe\n  | first = Katrina\n  | title = The Latest Chapter in CAD Software Evaluation\n  | publisher = ThomasNet\n  | date = 2003-05-22\n  | url = http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2003/05/the_latest_chap.html\n  | accessdate = 2006-12-30\n\n}}</ref>\n\n==Social context==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Kismet robot 20051016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Robotic]] [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]\nThe engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.\n\nBy its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.\n\nEngineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.\n\nEngineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.<ref name=\"MDG\">{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&faculty=14 |archivedate=2006-10-06|deadurl =yes|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Radar, [[GPS]], [[lidar]], ... are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]])]]\n\nAll overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios.

Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P.

[[Engineering management]] or \"Management engineering\" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical & electronics, power distribution & generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\n\n===Other fields===\nIn [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles.

In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.<ref>UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education</ref> Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].\n\nIn India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].\n\n===Secondary===\n[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|Students working with a teacher at Albany Senior High School, [[New Zealand]]]]\n{{Main|Secondary education}}\n[[File:LDAI 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Chilean high school students during a class photograph, 2002]]\n[[File:Phillips Exeter Academy (30511805865).jpg|thumb|Dormitories on the campus of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], United States, a [[private high school]]]]\nIn most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minor]]s, to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], \"postsecondary\", or \"[[Higher education|higher]]\" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s, [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.\n\nSecondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K\u201312 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1\u201313 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].\n\nSecondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high school]]s were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.\n\nSecondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.\n\n[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.\n\n===Tertiary (higher)===\n[[File:Distributed Intelligent Systems Department laboratory.jpg|thumb|Students in a laboratory, [[Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University]]]]\n{{see also|Higher education|Adult education}}\n[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]\nHigher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.\n\nHigher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.\n\nUniversity education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.\n\nOne type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a \"[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclop\u00e6dia''| work = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}</ref> Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],<ref>{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63\u201371 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}</ref> the term \"[[liberal arts college]]\" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].<ref>{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}</ref>\n\n===Vocational===\n[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]\n{{Main|Vocational education}}\n\n[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].\n\n===Special===\n{{Main|Special education}}\nIn the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[\u00c9douard S\u00e9guin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.<ref name=\"Credo Reference\">{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}</ref>\n\n==Other educational forms==\n\n===Alternative===\n{{Main|Alternative education}}\nWhile considered \"alternative\" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]s, [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]]s (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends school]]s, [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti school]]s, and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = 10 December 2013|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = The Huffington Post|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}</ref>\n\nIn time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]]s [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]], and [[Ivan Illich]].\n\n===Indigenous===\n[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]\n{{Main|Indigenous education}}\n[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to \"reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139\u201345|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}</ref>\n\n===Informal learning===\n{{main|Informal learning}}\n'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].\n\nIn informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.<ref name=Rogoff>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356\u2013401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Guti\u00e9rrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}</ref> For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461\u2013478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=9781139519526 }}</ref>\n\nWhile informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations.

This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:\n*Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.\n*Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.\n*Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.\n*Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.\n\nThe report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.<ref name=report/> Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.\n\n==Educational theory==\n[[File:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased [[high school]] [[graduation]] rates of students from [[low income]] families.<ref name=finn>{{Cite journal|author1=Finn, J.

Although the terms \"educational psychology\" and \"school psychology\" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].\n[[File:2013. \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]\nEducational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, & Raley, 2006).\n\n===The intelligence\u2013education relationship===\n{{Main|Psychology of education}}\n[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349\u201361 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}</ref> This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169\u201377 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}</ref> Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614\u201324 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}</ref>\n\n===Learning modalities===\nThere has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:<ref>Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., & Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.</ref>\n\n* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.\n* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.\n* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.\n\nOther commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].\n\nDunn and Dunn<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]<ref>[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences</ref> identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories.

Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.\n\nTo address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].\n\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.\n* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. \n* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: \"What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.\"\n* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and Wikipedia are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, [[Wikipedia]] is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].\n\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.<ref name=DOLencyclopedia /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /> There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.<ref name=bejoint /><ref name=EB /><ref name=DOLei /><ref name=OHEL22 /> Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.<ref name=bejoint />\n\nIn practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.<ref name=DOLei /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition>{{cite journal|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Histori\u00e6'', 1669 edition, title page]]\nOne of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77\u201379, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.<ref name=naturalis>Naturalis Historia</ref>\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.\n\nThe most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian]] Age was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.<ref>P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''</ref> Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century AD during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277203534|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart,|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534}}</ref> The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into French, Proven\u00e7al, Italian, English, Flemish, Anglo-Norman, Spanish, and German during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' \u2013 they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Tr\u00e9sor)''.<ref>Monique Paulmier-Foucart, \"Medieval Encyclopaedias\", in Andr\u00e9 Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke & Co, 2002.</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\n[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]\nMedieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.<ref name=\"dotma\">See \"Encyclopedia\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].\n\nThe term encyclopaedia was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Quintilian]], and combined the two Greek words \"''enkyklios paideia''\" into one word, \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: \"f. l.

Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.\n\nFinancial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher\u2019s work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454_Why_Encyclopedias_Got_Bigger_and_Smaller|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger \u2026 and Smaller|journal=Information & Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233\u2013254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}</ref>\n\n=== 18th\u201319th centuries ===\n[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|[[Encyclop\u00e9die]], 1773]]\nThe beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\".\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages{{which|date=December 2014}} saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\nPopular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''.\n\n[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].\n\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwblMaEW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001, [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] launched [[Wikipedia]], a multilingual, [[Open-source software|open-source]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

Japanese and Italian models were also in use.\n\nAround December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]], a Polish mathematician and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], while working at the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]], used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message encipherment procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French spy [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]] obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called [[Polish Enigma doubles|Enigma doubles]]. Rejewski was aided by [[cryptanalyst]]s [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 University]]. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German Enigma messages. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a [[cyclometer]] to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, made [[Zygalski sheets]] and built the electro-mechanical [[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]] to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six ''[[Bomba (cryptography)|bomby]]'', but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many ''bomby'' were needed, and the Poles did not have the resources.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=63}}\n\nOn 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

The mechanical subsystem consists of a [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]; a set of rotating disks called ''rotors'' arranged adjacently along a [[axle|spindle]]; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\n=== Electrical pathway ===\n[[File:Enigma wiring kleur.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Enigma wiring diagram with arrows and the numbers 1 to 9 showing how current flows from key depression to a lamp being lit. The ''A'' key is encoded to the ''D'' lamp. D yields A, but A never yields A; this property was due to a patented feature unique to the Enigmas, and could be exploited by cryptanalysts in some situations.]]\n\nThe mechanical parts act in such a way as to form a varying [[electrical network|electrical circuit]]. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display [[lamp (electrical component)|lamp]], which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting ''ANX...'', the operator would first press the ''A'' key, and the ''Z'' lamp might light, so ''Z'' would be the first letter of the [[ciphertext]]. The operator would next press ''N'', and then ''X'' in the same fashion, and so on.\n\n[[File:Enigma-action.svg|thumb|upright|The scrambling action of Enigma's rotors is shown for two consecutive letters with the right-hand rotor moving one position between them.]]\n\nCurrent flowed from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3). Next, it passed through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' M4 and ''Abwehr'' variants) installed rotors (5), and entered the reflector (6). The reflector returned the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\">Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm Technical details of the Enigma machine] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a [[polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter ''A'' encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to ''G'', and then to ''C''. This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\n=== Rotors ===\n[[File:Enigma rotors with alphabet rings.jpg|thumb|Enigma rotor assembly. In the Wehrmacht Enigma, the three installed movable rotors are sandwiched between two fixed wheels: the entry wheel, on the right, and the reflector on the left.]]\n{{Main|Enigma rotor details}}\n\nThe rotors (alternatively ''wheels'' or ''drums'', ''Walzen'' in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter made from hard [[rubber]] or [[bakelite]] with 26 [[brass]], spring-loaded, [[electrical contact]] pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plate [[electrical contacts]]. The pins and contacts represent the [[alphabet]]\u2014typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z (this will be assumed for the rest of this description). When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.\n\n[[File:enigma-rotors.jpg|thumb|left|Three Enigma rotors and the shaft, on which they are placed when in use.]]\n\nBy itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of [[encryption]]\u2014a simple [[substitution cipher]]. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter ''E'' might be wired to the contact for letter ''T'' on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nWhen placed in an Enigma, each rotor can be set to one of 26 possible positions. When inserted, it can be turned by hand using the grooved finger-wheel, which protrudes from the internal Enigma cover when closed. So that the operator can know the rotor's position, each had an ''alphabet tyre'' (or letter ring) attached to the outside of the rotor disc, with 26 characters (typically letters); one of these could be seen through the window, thus indicating the rotational position of the rotor. In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the rotor disc. A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the rotor disc. The position of the ring was known as the ''Ringstellung'' (\"ring setting\"), and was a part of the initial setting prior to an operating session. In modern terms it was a part of the [[initialization vector]].\n\n[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|left|Two Enigma rotors showing electrical contacts, stepping ratchet (on the left) and notch (on the right-hand rotor opposite '''D''').]]\nEach rotor contained a notch (or more than one) that controlled rotor stepping. In the military variants, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.\n\nThe Army and Air Force Enigmas were used with several rotors, initially three. On 15 December 1938, this changed to five, from which three were chosen for a given session. Rotors were marked with [[Roman numerals]] to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches located at different points on the alphabet ring. This variation was probably intended as a security measure, but ultimately allowed the Polish [[Clock (cryptography)|Clock Method]] and British [[Banburismus]] attacks.\n\nThe Naval version of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: at first six, then seven, and finally eight. The additional rotors were marked VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches, resulting in more frequent turnover. The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) machine accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version. This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner one and by adding a thin fourth rotor. That fourth rotor was one of two types, ''Beta'' or ''Gamma'', and never stepped, but could be manually set to any of 26 positions. One of the 26 made the machine perform identically to the three-rotor machine.\n\n=== Stepping ===\nTo avoid merely implementing a simple (and easily solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.\n\n=== Turnover ===\n[[File:Enigma ratchet.png|thumb|The Enigma stepping motion seen from the side away from the operator. All three ratchet pawls (green) push in unison as a key is depressed. For the first rotor (1), which to the operator is the right-hand rotor, the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the middle rotor (2) is engaged because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will step (''turn over'') with the first rotor. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.]]\n\nThe advancement of a rotor other than the left-hand one was called a ''turnover'' by the British. This was achieved by a [[ratchet and pawl]] mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression.<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.\n\nThe first five rotors to be introduced (I\u2013V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches. The position of the notch on each rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.<ref>{{cite web| last=Sale|first=Tony|authorlink=Anthony Sale|title=Technical specifications of the Enigma rotors| work=Technical Specification of the Enigma|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm|accessdate=15 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+Position of turnover notches\n|-\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Rotor\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Turnover position(s)\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| BP mnemonic\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|R|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Royal\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|F|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Flags\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|W|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Wave\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|K|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Kings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||V|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Above\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VI, VII and VIII|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A and N|||\n|}\n\nThe design also included a feature known as ''double-stepping''. This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor. If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the notch, advancing both rotors. In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only. If in moving forward the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps. Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping.<ref name=\"doublestepping\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Hamer |title=Enigma: Actions Involved in the 'Double-Stepping' of the Middle Rotor |journal=Cryptologia |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=January 1997 |pages=47\u201350 |url=http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |archivedate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081659/http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |format=zip |doi=10.1080/0161-119791885779}}</ref> This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from [[odometer]]-style regular motion.\n\n<!--{|\n|-\n|ADM\n|-\n|ADN\n|-\n|ADO\n|-\n|ADP\n|-\n|ADQ\n|-\n|AER\n|-\n|AFS\n|-\n|AFT\n|-\n|AFU\n|}-->\nWith three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine had a period of 26 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 26 = 16,900 (not 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26, because of double-stepping).<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> Historically, messages were limited to a few hundred letters, and so there was no chance of repeating any combined rotor position during a single session, denying cryptanalysts valuable clues.\n\nTo make room for the Naval fourth rotors, the reflector was made much thinner. The fourth rotor fitted into the space made available. No other changes were made, which eased the changeover. Since there were only three pawls, the fourth rotor never stepped, but could be manually set into one of 26 possible positions.\n\nA device that was designed, but not implemented before the war's end, was the ''L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze'' (gap-fill wheel) that implemented irregular stepping. It allowed field configuration of notches in all 26 positions. If the number of notches was a [[Coprime integers|relative prime]] of 26 and the number of notches were different for each wheel, the stepping would be more unpredictable. Like the Umkehrwalze-D it also allowed the internal wiring to be reconfigured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/lf/index.htm |title=L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze |publisher=Cryptomuseum.com |date= |accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Entry wheel ===\nThe current entry wheel (''Eintrittswalze'' in German), or entry [[stator]], connects the [[plugboard]] to the rotor assembly. If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved an obstacle to Rejewski's progress during his study of the rotor wirings. The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a [[QWERTZ]] keyboard: ''Q''&rarr;''A'', ''W''&rarr;''B'', ''E''&rarr;''C'' and so on. The military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: ''A''&rarr;''A'', ''B''&rarr;''B'', ''C''&rarr;''C'', and so on. It took inspired guesswork for Rejewski to penetrate the modification.\n\n=== Reflector ===\n[[File:Enigma insides.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Internal mechanism of an Enigma machine showing the type B reflector and rotor stack.]]\nWith the exception of models ''A'' and ''B'', the last rotor came before a 'reflector' (German: ''Umkehrwalze'', meaning 'reversal rotor'), a patented feature unique to Enigma among the period's various rotor machines. The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma is [[Involution (mathematics)|self-reciprocal]]: conveniently, encryption was the same as decryption. The reflector also gave Enigma the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself. This was a severe conceptual flaw and a cryptological mistake subsequently exploited by codebreakers.\n\nIn Model 'C', the reflector could be inserted in one of two different positions. In Model 'D', the reflector could be set in 26 possible positions, although it did not move during encryption. In the ''Abwehr'' Enigma, the reflector stepped during encryption in a manner similar to the other wheels.\n\nIn the German Army and Air Force Enigma, the reflector was fixed and did not rotate; there were four versions. The original version was marked 'A', and was replaced by ''Umkehrwalze B'' on 1 November 1937. A third version, ''Umkehrwalze C'' was used briefly in 1940, possibly by mistake, and was solved by [[Hut 6]].<ref name=\"ukwd-1\">Philip Marks, \"Umkehrwalze D: Enigma's Rewirable Reflector \u2014 Part I\", Cryptologia 25(2), April 2001, pp. 101\u2013141</ref> The fourth version, first observed on 2 January 1944, had a rewireable reflector, called ''Umkehrwalze D'', nick-named Uncle Dick by the British, allowing the Enigma operator to alter the connections as part of the key settings.{{Clear}}\n\n=== Plugboard ===\n[[File:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumb|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. When in use during World War II, there were ten connections. In this photograph, just two pairs of letters have been swapped (A\u2194J and S\u2194O).]]\n\nThe plugboard (''Steckerbrett'' in German) permitted variable wiring that could be reconfigured by the operator (visible on the front panel of Figure 1; some of the patch cords can be seen in the lid). It was introduced on German Army versions in 1930, and was soon adopted by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' ([[German Navy]]). The plugboard contributed more cryptographic strength than an extra rotor. Enigma without a plugboard (known as ''unsteckered Enigma'') can be solved relatively straightforwardly using hand methods; these techniques are generally defeated by the plugboard, driving Allied cryptanalysts to develop special machines to solve it.\n\nA cable placed onto the plugboard connected letters in pairs; for example, ''E'' and ''Q'' might be a steckered pair. The effect was to swap those letters before and after the main rotor scrambling unit. For example, when an operator presses ''E'', the signal was diverted to ''Q'' before entering the rotors. Up to 13 steckered pairs might be used at one time, although only 10 were normally used.\n\nCurrent flowed from the keyboard through the plugboard, and proceeded to the entry-rotor or ''Eintrittswalze''. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a plug disconnected the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug at the other end of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's jacks, thus switching the connections of the two letters.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:Enigma-printer-2.jpg|thumb|The ''Schreibmax'' was a printing unit which could be attached to the Enigma, removing the need for laboriously writing down the letters indicated on the light panel.]]\n\nOther features made various Enigma machines more secure or more convenient.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reuvers |first=Paul |title=Enigma accessories |year=2008 |url=http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/enigma_acc.html |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Schreibmax'' ====\nSome M4 Enigmas used the ''Schreibmax'', a small [[Computer printer|printer]] that could print the 26 letters on a narrow paper ribbon. This eliminated the need for a second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The ''Schreibmax'' was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the lamp panel. To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted [[plaintext]].\n\n==== ''Fernleseger\u00e4t'' ====\nAnother accessory was the remote lamp panel ''Fernleseger\u00e4t''. For machines equipped with the extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel. A lamp panel version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the ''Schreibmax'', that the lamp panel and lightbulbs be removed.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> The remote panel made it possible for a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.\n\n==== ''Uhr'' ====\n[[File:Enigma-uhr-box.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Enigma Uhr attachment]]\nIn 1944, the ''Luftwaffe'' introduced a plugboard switch, called the ''Uhr'' (clock), a small box containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch into one of the 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> In one switch position, the ''Uhr'' did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.\n\n=== Mathematical analysis ===\nThe Enigma transformation for each letter can be specified mathematically as a product of [[permutation]]s.{{sfn|Rejewski|1980}} Assuming a three-rotor German Army/Air Force Enigma, let <math>P</math> denote the plugboard transformation, <math>U</math> denote that of the reflector, and <math>L, M, R</math> denote those of the left, middle and right rotors respectively. Then the encryption <math>E</math> can be expressed as\n\n:<math>E = PRMLUL^{-1}M^{-1}R^{-1}P^{-1}.</math>\n\nAfter each key press, the rotors turn, changing the transformation.

For each letter typed in, a lamp indicated a different letter according to a [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] substitution, based upon the wiring of the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded as the enciphered substitution. The action of pressing a key also moved the rotor so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor, giving a different [[Pseudorandomness|substitution alphabet]]. This continued for each letter in the message until the message was completed and a series of substitutions, each different from the others, had occurred to create a cyphertext from the plaintext. The cyphertext would then be transmitted as normal to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would key in the cyphertext and\u2014as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine\u2014for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge.\n\n=== Details ===\n[[File:Kenngruppenheft.jpg|thumb|German Kenngruppenheft (a U-boat [[codebook]] with grouped key codes)]]\n[[File:Enigma keylist 3 rotor.jpg|thumb|Monthly key list Number 649 for the German Air Force Enigma, including settings for the reconfigurable reflector.]]\nIn use, the Enigma required a list of daily key settings and auxiliary documents. In German military practice, communications were divided into separate networks, each using different settings. These communication nets were termed ''keys'' at [[Bletchley Park]], and were assigned [[code name]]s, such as ''Red'', ''Chaffinch'', and ''Shark''. Each unit operating in a network was given the same settings list for its Enigma, valid for a period of time. The procedures for German Naval Enigma were more elaborate and more secure than those in other services and employed auxiliary [[codebook]]s. Navy codebooks were printed in red, water-soluble ink on pink paper so that they could easily be destroyed if they were endangered or if the vessel was sunk.\n\nAn Enigma machine's setting (its [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] in modern terms; ''Schl\u00fcssel'' in German) specified each operator-adjustable aspect of the machine:\n* Wheel order (''Walzenlage'') \u2013 the choice of rotors and the order in which they are fitted.\n* Ring settings (''Ringstellung'') \u2013 the position of each alphabet ring relative to its rotor wiring.\n* Plug connections (''Steckerverbindungen'') \u2013 the pairs of letters in the plugboard that are connected together.\n* In very late versions, the wiring of the reconfigurable reflector.\n* Starting position of the rotors (''Grundstellung'') \u2013 chosen by the operator, should be different for each message.\n\nFor a message to be correctly encrypted and decrypted, both sender and receiver had to configure their Enigma in the same way; rotor selection and order, ring positions, plugboard connections and starting rotor positions must be identical. Except for the starting positions, these settings were established beforehand, distributed in key lists and changed daily. For example, the settings for the 18th day of the month in the German Luftwaffe Enigma key list number 649 (see image) were as follows:\n* Wheel order: IV, II, V\n* Ring settings: 15, 23, 26\n* Plugboard connections: EJ OY IV AQ KW FX MT PS LU BD\n* Reconfigurable reflector wiring: IU AS DV GL FT OX EZ CH MR KN BQ PW\n* Indicator groups: lsa zbw vcj rxn\n\nEnigma was designed to be secure even if the rotor wiring was known to an opponent, although in practice considerable effort protected the wiring configuration. If the wiring is secret, the total number of possible configurations has been calculated to be around 3 x 10<sup>114</sup> (approximately 380 bits); with known wiring and other operational constraints, this is reduced to around 10<sup>23</sup> (76 bits).<ref name=\"engima_cryptographic_mathematics\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last=Miller|first=A. Ray|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2001|ref=harv}}</ref> Users of Enigma were confident of its security because of the large number of possibilities; it was not then feasible for an adversary to even begin to try a [[brute force attack]].\n\n=== Indicator ===\n{{See also|Cryptanalysis#Indicator}}\nMost of the key was kept constant for a set time period, typically a day. A different initial rotor position was used for each message, a concept similar to an [[Initialization vector|initialisation vector]] in modern cryptography. The reason is that encrypting many messages with identical or near-identical settings (termed in cryptanalysis as being ''in [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depth]]''), would enable an attack using a statistical procedure such as [[William F. Friedman|Friedman's]] [[Index of coincidence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman| first=W.F.|authorlink=William F. Friedman|title=The index of coincidence and its applications in cryptology|series=Department of Ciphers. Publ 22|publisher=Riverbank Laboratories|location=Geneva, Illinois, USA|oclc=55786052|year=1922}}</ref> The starting position for the rotors was transmitted just before the ciphertext, usually after having been enciphered. The exact method used was termed the ''indicator procedure''. Design weakness and operator sloppiness in these indicator procedures were two of the main weaknesses that made cracking Enigma possible.\n\n[[File:Enigma-rotor-windows.jpg|left|thumb|Figure 2. With the inner lid down, the Enigma was ready for use. The finger wheels of the rotors protruded through the lid, allowing the operator to set the rotors, and their current position, here ''RDKP'', was visible to the operator through a set of windows.]]\n\nOne of the earliest ''indicator procedures'' for the Enigma was cryptographically flawed and allowed Polish cryptanalysts to make the initial breaks into the plugboard Enigma. The procedure had the operator set his machine in accordance with the secret settings that all operators on the net shared. The settings included an initial position for the rotors (the ''Grundstellung''), say, ''AOH''. The operator turned his rotors until ''AOH'' was visible through the rotor windows. At that point, the operator chose his own arbitrary starting position for the message he would send. An operator might select ''EIN'', and that became the ''message setting'' for that encryption session. The operator then typed ''EIN'' into the machine twice. The results were the encrypted indicator. The ''EIN'' typed twice might encrypt into ''XHTLOA'', which would be transmitted along with the encrypted message. Finally, the operator then spun the rotors to his message settings, ''EIN'' in this example, and typed the plaintext of the message.\n\nAt the receiving end, the operator set the machine to the initial settings and typed in the first six letters of the message (''XHTLOA''). In this example, ''EINEIN'' emerged on the lamps, so the operator would learn the ''message setting'' that the sender used to encrypt this message. The receiving operator would set his rotors to ''EIN'', type in the rest of the ciphertext, and get the deciphered message.\n\nThis indicator scheme had two weaknesses. First, the use of a global initial position (''Grundstellung'') meant all message keys used the same polyalphabetic substitution. In later indicator procedures, the operator selected his initial position for encrypting the indicator and sent that initial position in the clear. The second problem was the repetition of the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. These security flaws enabled the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. The early indicator procedure was subsequently described by German cryptanalysts as the \"faulty indicator technique\".{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}\n\nDuring World War II, codebooks were only used each day to set up the rotors, their ring settings and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random start position, let's say ''WZA'', and a random message key, perhaps ''SXT''. He moved the rotors to the ''WZA'' start position and encoded the message key ''SXT''. Assume the result was ''UHL''. He then set up the message key, ''SXT'', as the start position and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the start position, ''WZA'', the encoded message key, ''UHL'', and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the start position according to the first trigram, ''WZA'', and decoded the second trigram, ''UHL'', to obtain the ''SXT'' message setting. Next, he used this ''SXT'' message setting as the start position to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm Enigma message procedures] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThis procedure was used by ''Wehrmacht'' and ''Luftwaffe'' only. The ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures on sending messages with the Enigma were far more complex and elaborate. Prior to encryption the message was encoded using the ''[[Kurzsignale|Kurzsignalheft]]'' code book. The ''Kurzsignalheft'' contained tables to convert sentences into four-letter groups. A great many choices were included, for example, logistic matters such as refuelling and rendezvous with supply ships, positions and grid lists, harbour names, countries, weapons, weather conditions, enemy positions and ships, date and time tables. Another codebook contained the ''[[Discriminant Book|Kenngruppen]]'' and ''Spruchschl\u00fcssel'': the key identification and message key.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/kurzsignale.htm Kurzsignalen on German U-boats] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\n=== Additional details ===\nThe Army Enigma machine used only the 26 alphabet characters. Punctuation was replaced with rare character combinations. A space was omitted or replaced with an X. The X was generally used as full-stop.\n\nSome punctuation marks were different in other parts of the armed forces. The ''Wehrmacht'' replaced a comma with ZZ and the question mark with FRAGE or FRAQ.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' replaced the comma with Y and the question mark with UD. The combination CH, as in \"''Acht''\" (eight) or \"''Richtung''\" (direction), was replaced with Q (AQT, RIQTUNG). Two, three and four zeros were replaced with CENTA, MILLE and MYRIA.\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' and the ''Luftwaffe'' transmitted messages in groups of five characters.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'', using the four rotor Enigma, had four-character groups. Frequently used names or words were varied as much as possible. Words like ''Minensuchboot'' (minesweeper) could be written as MINENSUCHBOOT, MINBOOT, MMMBOOT or MMM354. To make cryptanalysis harder, messages were limited to 250 characters. Longer messages were divided into several parts, each using a different message key.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/eniggnix.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma General Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/officer/officerx.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma Officer and Staff Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n== History ==\nThe Enigma family included multiple designs.

This version was widely used, with shipments to Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Spain, United States and Poland.

This Enigma variant was a four-wheel unsteckered machine with multiple notches on the rotors. This model was equipped with a counter which incremented upon each key press, and so is also known as the \"counter machine\" or the ''Z\u00e4hlwerk'' Enigma.\n\n==== Wehrmacht Enigma I (1930\u20131938) ====\nEnigma machine G was modified to the ''Enigma I'' by June 1930.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}} Enigma I is also known as the ''Wehrmacht'', or \"Services\" Enigma, and was used extensively by German military services and other government organisations (such as the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft|railways]]{{sfn|Smith|2000|p= 73}}) before and during [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-769-0229-10A, Frankreich, Guderian, \"Enigma\" croppped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinz Guderian]] in the [[Battle of France]], with an Enigma machine]]\n\nThe major difference between ''Enigma I'' (German Army version from 1930), and commercial Enigma models was the addition of a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, greatly increasing cryptographic strength.\n\nOther differences included the use of a fixed reflector and the relocation of the stepping notches from the rotor body to the movable letter rings.

Replicas are available in various forms, including an exact reconstructed copy of the Naval M4 model, an Enigma implemented in electronics (Enigma-E), various simulators and paper-and-scissors analogues.\n\nA rare ''Abwehr'' Enigma machine, designated G312, was stolen from the Bletchley Park museum on 1 April 2000. In September, a man identifying himself as \"The Master\" sent a note demanding \u00a325,000 and threatening to destroy the machine if the ransom was not paid. In early October 2000, Bletchley Park officials announced that they would pay the ransom, but the stated deadline passed with no word from the blackmailer. Shortly afterward, the machine was sent anonymously to BBC journalist [[Jeremy Paxman]], missing three rotors.\n\nIn November 2000, an antiques dealer named Dennis Yates was arrested after telephoning ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to arrange the return of the missing parts. The Enigma machine was returned to Bletchley Park after the incident. In October 2001, Yates was sentenced to 10 months in prison and served three months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1609168.stm|work=BBC News|title=Man jailed over Enigma machine|date=19 October 2001|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, the Spanish daily newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' reported that 28 Enigma machines had been discovered by chance in an attic of Army headquarters in Madrid. These 4-rotor commercial machines had helped Franco's Nationalists win the [[Spanish Civil War]] because, though the British cryptologist [[Alfred Dilwyn Knox]] in 1937 broke the cipher generated by Franco's Enigma machines, this was not disclosed to the Republicans, who failed to break the cipher.

The British [[Typex]] was originally derived from the Enigma patents; Typex even includes features from the patent descriptions that were omitted from the actual Enigma machine. The British paid no royalties for the use of the patents, to protect secrecy. The Typex implementation is not the same as that found in German or other Axis versions.\n\nA Japanese Enigma clone was codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers. Little used, it contained four rotors mounted vertically. In the U.S., cryptologist [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] designed the [[M-325]], a machine logically similar, although not in construction.\n\nA unique rotor machine was constructed in 2002 by Netherlands-based Tatjana van Vark. This device makes use of 40-point rotors, allowing letters, numbers and some punctuation to be used; each rotor contains 509 parts.<ref>van Vark, Tatjana ''[http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvv1/pht10.html The coding machine]''</ref>\n\nMachines like the [[SIGABA]], [[NEMA (machine)|NEMA]], [[Typex]] and so forth, are deliberately not considered to be Enigma derivatives as their internal ciphering functions are not mathematically identical to the Enigma transform.\n\nSeveral software implementations exist, but not all exactly match Enigma behaviour. The most commonly used software derivative (that is not compliant with any hardware implementation of the Enigma) is at EnigmaCo.de. Many Java applet Enigmas only accept single letter entry, complicating use even if the applet is Enigma compliant. Technically, Enigma@home is the largest scale deployment of a software Enigma, but the decoding software does not implement encipherment making it a derivative (as all original machines could cipher and decipher).\n\nA user-friendly 3-rotor simulator, where users can select rotors, use the plugboard and define new settings for the rotors and reflectors is available.<ref>[http://w1tp.com/enigma/enigma_w.zip 3 rotor download]</ref> The output appears in separate windows which can be independently made \"invisible\" to hide decryption.<ref>[http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ Enigma at Multimania]</ref> Another includes an \"autotyping\" function which takes plaintext from a clipboard and converts it to cyphertext (or vice versa) at one of four speeds. The \"very fast\" option produces 26 characters in less than one second.<ref>[http://w1tp.com/enigma/EnigmaSim.zip Autotype download]</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"148px\">\nFile:Japanese secure teletype 2.jpg|A Japanese Enigma clone, codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers.\nFile:Tatjavanavark-machine.jpg|Tatjana van Vark's Enigma-inspired rotor machine.\nFile:Enigma simulator-IMG 0515-black.jpg|Electronic implementation of an Enigma machine, sold at the Bletchley Park souvenir shop\n</gallery>\n\n== Simulators ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Turing was played by [[Derek Jacobi]], who also played Turing in a 1996 television adaptation of the play.\n* [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' (1995)  is set against the backdrop of World War II [[Bletchley Park]] and cryptologists working to read Naval Enigma in [[Hut 8]]. \n* [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999) prominently features the Enigma machine and efforts to break it, and portrays the German U-boat command under [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] using it in apparently deliberate ignorance of its penetration.\n\n; Films\n* ''[[Sekret Enigmy]]'' (1979; translation: ''The Enigma Secret''), is a Polish film dealing with Polish aspects of the subject.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0079878}}</ref>\n* The plot of the film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' (released in 2000) revolves around an attempt by American, rather than British, forces to seize an Enigma machine from a German U-boat.\n* Harris' book, with substantial changes in plot, was adapted as the film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starring [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Dougray Scott]]. The film was criticised for historical inaccuracies, including neglect of the role of [[Poland]]'s ''[[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]]''. The film\u2014like the book\u2014makes a Pole the villain, who seeks to betray the secret of Enigma decryption.<ref>{{cite new|author=Laurence Peter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm |title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date= 20 July 2009}}</ref>\n* The film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'' (2014) tells the story of [[Alan Turing]] and his attempts to crack the Enigma machine code during World War II.<ref name=ng />\n\n; Television\n* In the British television series ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]'', the [[Typex]] was used by the protagonists during the war, and in Season 2, Episode 4, they visit [[Bletchley Park]] to seek one out, in order to crack the code of the [[black market]] procurer and smuggler Marta, who used the Typex to encode her ledger.

At the maximum reaction rate (''V''<sub>max</sub>) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.<ref name = \"Stryer_2002\"/>{{rp|8.4}}\n\n''V''<sub>max</sub> is only one of several important kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the [[Michaelis-Menten constant]] (''K''<sub>m</sub>), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic ''K''<sub>M</sub> for a given substrate. Another useful constant is ''k''<sub>cat</sub>, also called the ''turnover number'', which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.<ref name = \"Stryer_2002\"/>{{rp|8.4}}\n\nThe efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of ''k''<sub>cat</sub>/''K''<sub>m</sub>. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the [[rate constant]]s for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> (M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called ''[[catalytically perfect enzyme|catalytically perfect]]'' or ''kinetically perfect''. Example of such enzymes are [[triosephosphateisomerase|triose-phosphate isomerase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]], [[acetylcholinesterase]], [[catalase]], [[fumarase]], [[\u03b2-lactamase]], and [[superoxide dismutase]].<ref name = \"Stryer_2002\"/>{{rp|8.4.2}} The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.<ref name = \"Stryer_2002\"/>{{rp|9.2}} But most enzymes are far from perfect: the average values of <math>k_{\\rm cat}/K_{\\rm m}</math> and <math>k_{\\rm cat}</math> are about <math> 10^5 {\\rm s}^{-1}{\\rm M}^{-1}</math> and <math>10 {\\rm s}^{-1}</math>, respectively.<ref name=\"Bar-Even_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-Even A, Noor E, Savir Y, Liebermeister W, Davidi D, Tawfik DS, Milo R | title = The moderately efficient enzyme: evolutionary and physicochemical trends shaping enzyme parameters | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 21 | pages = 4402\u201310 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21506553 | doi = 10.1021/bi2002289 }}</ref>\n\nMichaelis\u2013Menten kinetics relies on the [[law of mass action]], which is derived from the assumptions of free [[diffusion]] and thermodynamically driven random collision.

Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps and could not be regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, \"Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?\" is a meta-ethical question.\n\nMeta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].\n\nStudies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/</ref> Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.\n\nThe [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123\u2013155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}</ref>\n\n==Normative ethics==\n{{Main|Normative ethics}}\nNormative ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.<ref name=bbc/> Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].\n\n===Virtue ethics===\n{{main|Virtue ethics}}\n[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]\nVirtue ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469\u2013399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\">{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2}}</ref>{{rp|32\u201333}}\n\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013323&nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed \"virtuous\". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.\n\nAristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.\n\n====Stoicism====\n{{main|Stoicism}}\n[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]\nThe [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The \"unconquerable will\" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not \"lose\" their life, but instead \"return\", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\n====Contemporary virtue ethics====\nModern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\". Anscombe argues that consequentialist and deontological ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in divine law. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to \"universal standards\", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.<ref name=\"Vries\">{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S.

There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Cyrenaic hedonism====\nFounded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. \"Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\" Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Epicureanism====\n{{Main|Epicureanism}}\nEpicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] \"...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue.\"<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref> He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\n===State consequentialism===\n{{Main|State consequentialism}}\n[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,<ref name=\"readings\">{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}</ref> is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.<ref name=readings/> The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as \"a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\".<ref>Fraser, Chris, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]\", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N.

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''\"The ends justify the means\"''.\n\nThe term \"consequentialism\" was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].<ref name=\"Anscombe\">{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M.

Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:\n* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?\n* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?\n* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?\n\nOne way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.\n\n====Utilitarianism====\n{{Main|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]\n[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]\nUtilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as \"happiness\", \"welfare\", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action.

In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.<ref name=\"Carnegie Mellon University\">{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Deontology===\n<!-- Section linked from \"Categorical imperative\" -->\n{{Main|Deontological ethics}}\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\nDeontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''deon'', \"obligation, duty\"; and {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]</ref>  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself.

Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, they make the situation ethically worse.

The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist, and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]].\n\nStarting from the premise that the goal of ethical philosophy should be to help humans adapt and thrive in evolutionary terms, Kropotkin's ethical framework uses biology and anthropology as a basis \u2013 in order to scientifically establish what will best enable a given social order to thrive biologically and socially \u2013 and advocates certain behavioural practices to enhance humanity's capacity for freedom and well-being, namely practices which emphasise solidarity, equality, and justice.\n\nKropotkin argues that ethics itself is evolutionary, and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through cultural history, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of morality. The origin of ethical feeling in both animals and humans can be found, he claims, in the natural fact of \"sociality\" (mutualistic symbiosis), which humans can then combine with the instinct for justice (i.e. equality) and then with the practice of reason to construct a non-supernatural and anarchistic system of ethics.<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf \"Ethics: Origin and Development\" by P\u00ebtr Kropotkin]</ref> Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality at the core of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: <blockquote>This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.<ref>[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html \"Anarchist morality\", chapter VI, P\u00ebtr Kropotkin]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Postmodern ethics===\n{{Main|Postmodernism}}\n{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}\nThe 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.\n\n[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, at least in part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that \"there is no outside-text/non-text\" (\"''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''\" is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside the text\"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.\n\nPost-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.\n\n[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.\n\nDavid Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the \"ethical turn\" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the \"obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable\" (2004, p.&nbsp;103).\n\nHoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as \"not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless\"(2004, p.&nbsp;8).\n\nHoy concludes that\n{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}\n\n==Applied ethics==\n{{Main|Applied ethics}}\nApplied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].\n\n===Specific questions===\nApplied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: \"Is getting an abortion immoral?\" \"Is euthanasia immoral?\" \"Is affirmative action right or wrong?\" \"What are human rights, and how do we determine them?\" \"Do animals have rights as well?\" and \"Do individuals have the right of self-determination?\"<ref name=bbc/>\n\nA more specific question could be: \"If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?\" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration\u2014in fact, no common assumptions of all participants\u2014so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, \"Is lying always wrong?\" and, \"If not, when is it permissible?\" is prior to any etiquette.\n\nPeople, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a \"yes or no\", \"right or wrong\" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.\n\n===Particular fields of application===\n====Bioethics====\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\n{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}\nBioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|\"the ethics of the ordinary\"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.\n\nBioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics |accessdate=December 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins, e.g. \"three parent baby, where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.

Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.\n\nBusiness ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"<ref>Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.</ref> Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.<ref>Berle, A. A., & Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, \"Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'\u2014as there once was a feudal system\u2014which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&nbsp;...

This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.\n\n====Military ethics====\n{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}\n\nMilitary ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.<ref>{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}</ref> [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics.

Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical\u2014such as, \"Is ethical knowledge possible?\"\u2014are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:\n* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics\u2014and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.\n* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] (\"Miss Manners\"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.\n* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing \"right versus right\", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.\n* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing.

The row and column indices of nonwhite cells are the related elements, while the different colors, other than light gray, indicate the  equivalence classes (each light gray cell is its own equivalence class).]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''equivalence relation''' is a [[binary relation]] that is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The relation \"is equal to\" is the canonical example of an equivalence relation, where for any objects {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}:\n* {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''a''}} (reflexive property),\n* if {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}} then {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}} (symmetric property), and\n* if {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''c''}} then {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''c''}} (transitive property).\n\nAs a consequence of the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties, any equivalence relation provides a [[partition of a set|partition]] of the underlying set into disjoint [[equivalence classes]]. Two elements of the given set are equivalent to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class.\n\n== Notation ==\nVarious notations are used in the literature to denote that two elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} of a set are equivalent with respect to an equivalence relation {{math|''R''}}; the most common are \"{{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}}\" and \"{{math|''a'' \u2261 ''b''}}\", which are used when {{math|''R''}} is implicit, and variations of \"{{math|''a'' ~<sub>''R''</sub> ''b''}}\", \"{{math|''a'' \u2261<sub>''R''</sub> ''b''}}\", or \"{{math|''aRb''}}\" to specify {{math|''R''}} explicitly. Non-equivalence may be written \"{{math|''a'' \u2241 ''b''}}\" or \"<math>a \\not\\equiv b</math>\".\n\n== Definition ==\nA given [[binary relation]] ~ on a set ''X'' is said to be an equivalence relation [[if and only if]] it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. That is, for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''X'':\n*''a'' ~ ''a''. ([[reflexive relation|Reflexivity]])\n*''a'' ~ ''b'' if and only if ''b'' ~ ''a''. ([[symmetric relation|Symmetry]])\n*if ''a'' ~ ''b'' and ''b'' ~ ''c'' then ''a'' ~ ''c''. ([[transitive relation|Transitivity]])\n\n''X'' together with the relation ~ is called a [[setoid]]. The [[equivalence class]] of <math>a</math> under ~, denoted <math>[a]</math>, is defined as <math>[a] = \\{b\\in X \\mid a\\sim b\\}</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Simple example ===\nLet the set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math> have the equivalence relation <math>\\{(a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(b,c),(c,b)\\}</math>. The following sets are [[equivalence classes]] of this relation:\n\n<math>[a]=\\{a\\}, ~~~~ [b]=[c]=\\{b,c\\}</math>.\n\nThe set of all equivalence classes for this relation is <math>\\{\\{a\\},\\{b,c\\}\\}</math>. This set is a [[Partition_of_a_set|partition]] of the set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math>.\n\n=== Equivalence relations ===\n\nThe following are all equivalence relations:\n* \"Is equal to\" on the set of numbers.  For example, <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math> is equal to <math>\\tfrac{4}{8}</math>.\n* \"Has the same birthday as\" on the set of all people.\n* \"Is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to\" on the set of all [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]]s.\n* \"Is [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to\" on the set of all [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]]s.\n* \"Is congruent to, [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n''\" on the [[integers]].\n* \"Has the same [[image (mathematics)|image]] under a [[function (mathematics)|function]]\" on the elements of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain of the function]].\n* \"Has the same absolute value\" on the set of real numbers\n* \"Has the same cosine\" on the set of all angles.\n\n=== Relations that are not equivalences ===\n* The relation \"\u2265\" between real numbers is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric. For example, 7 \u2265 5 does not imply that 5 \u2265 7.  It is, however, a [[total order]].\n* The relation \"has a [[common factor]] greater than 1 with\" between [[natural numbers]] greater than 1, is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. (Example: The natural numbers 2 and 6 have a common factor greater than 1, and 6 and 3 have a common factor greater than 1, but 2 and 3 do not have a common factor greater than 1).\n* The [[empty relation]] ''R'' on a [[non-empty]] set ''X'' (i.e. ''aRb'' is never true) is [[vacuously true|vacuously]] symmetric and transitive, but not reflexive. (If ''X'' is also empty then ''R'' ''is'' reflexive.)\n* The relation \"is approximately equal to\" between real numbers, even if more precisely defined, is not an equivalence relation, because although reflexive and symmetric, it is not transitive, since multiple small changes can accumulate to become a big change. However, if the approximation is defined asymptotically, for example by saying that two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are approximately equal near some point if the limit of ''f \u2212 g'' is 0 at that point, then this defines an equivalence relation.\n\n==Connections to other relations==\n\n*A [[partial order]] is a relation that is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], ''[[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]]'', and [[transitive relation|transitive]].\n*[[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] is both an equivalence relation and a partial order. Equality is also the only relation on a set that is reflexive, symmetric and antisymmetric. In [[algebraic expression]]s, equal variables may be [[substitution (algebra)|substituted]] for one another, a facility that is not available for equivalence related variables. The [[equivalence class]]es of an equivalence relation can substitute for one another, but not individuals within a class.\n*A [[strict partial order]] is irreflexive, transitive, and [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]].\n*A [[partial equivalence relation]] is transitive and symmetric. Transitive and symmetric imply reflexive [[if and only if]] for all ''a ''\u2208 ''X'', there exists a ''b ''\u2208 ''X'' such that ''a ''~ ''b''.\n*A reflexive and symmetric relation is a [[dependency relation]], if finite, and a [[tolerance relation]] if infinite.\n*A [[preorder]] is reflexive and transitive.\n*A [[congruence relation]] is an equivalence relation whose domain ''X'' is also the underlying set for an [[algebraic structure]], and which respects the additional structure. In general, congruence relations play the role of [[Kernel (algebra)|kernels]] of homomorphisms, and the quotient of a structure by a congruence relation can be formed. In many important cases congruence relations have an alternative representation as substructures of the structure on which they are defined. E.g. the congruence relations on groups correspond to the [[normal subgroup]]s.\n*Any equivalence relation is the negation of an [[apartness relation]], though the converse statement only holds in [[classical mathematics]] (as opposed to [[constructive mathematics]]), since it is equivalent to the [[law of excluded middle]].\n*A [[serial relation]] ~ satisfies &forall; ''a'' &exist; ''b'' &nbsp; ''a'' ~ ''b''. Evidently it is sufficient for a serial relation ~ to be symmetric and transitive for it also to be reflexive. Indeed, since the relation is serial, every element is in the relation. Then, using symmetry, reflexivity can be concluded from transitivity by identifying the first and third variables in the transitive axiom. Therefore, an equivalence relation may be alternatively defined as a symmetric, transitive, serial relation.\n\n== Well-definedness under an equivalence relation ==\n\nIf ~ is an equivalence relation on ''X'', and ''P''(''x'') is a property of elements of ''X'', such that whenever ''x'' ~ ''y'', ''P''(''x'') is true if ''P''(''y'') is true, then the property ''P'' is said to be [[well-defined]] or a ''class invariant'' under the relation ~.\n\nA frequent particular case occurs when ''f'' is a function from ''X'' to another set ''Y''; if ''x''<sub>1</sub> ~ ''x''<sub>2</sub> implies ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) = ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>) then ''f'' is said to be a ''morphism'' for ~, a ''class invariant under'' ~, or simply ''invariant under'' ~. This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. The latter case with the function ''f'' can be expressed by a commutative triangle. See also [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].  Some authors use \"compatible with ~\" or just \"respects ~\" instead of \"invariant under ~\".\n\nMore generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation ~<sub>A</sub>) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation ~<sub>B</sub>).  Such a function is known as a morphism from ~<sub>A</sub> to ~<sub>B</sub>.\n\n== Equivalence class, quotient set, partition ==\nLet <math>a,b\\in X</math>. Some definitions:\n\n=== Equivalence class ===\n{{main|Equivalence class}}\nA subset ''Y'' of ''X'' such that ''a'' ~ ''b'' holds for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''Y'', and never for ''a'' in ''Y'' and ''b'' outside ''Y'', is called an '''equivalence class''' of ''X'' by ~. Let <math>[a] := \\{x \\in X \\mid a \\sim x\\}</math> denote the equivalence class to which ''a'' belongs. All elements of ''X'' equivalent to each other are also elements of the same equivalence class.\n\n=== Quotient set ===\n{{main|Quotient set}}\nThe set of all possible equivalence classes of ''X'' by ~, denoted <math> X/\\mathord{\\sim} := \\{[x] \\mid x \\in X\\}</math>, is the '''quotient set''' of ''X'' by ~. If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], there is a natural way of transforming ''X''/~ into a topological space; see [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] for the details.\n\n=== Projection ===\n{{main|Projection (relational algebra)}}\nThe '''projection''' of ~ is the function <math>\\pi: X \\to X/\\mathord{\\sim} </math> defined by <math>\\pi(x) = [x]</math> which maps elements of ''X'' into their respective equivalence classes by ~.\n\n:'''Theorem''' on [[Projection (set theory)|projection]]s:<ref>[[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], 1999 (1967).

Then there is a unique function ''g'' : ''X/~'' &rarr; ''B'', such that ''f'' = ''g''&pi;. If ''f'' is a [[surjection]] and ''a'' ~ ''b'' &harr; ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b''), then ''g'' is a [[bijection]].\n\n=== Equivalence kernel ===\nThe '''equivalence kernel''' of a function ''f'' is the equivalence relation ~ defined by <math>x\\sim y \\iff f(x) = f(y)</math>. The equivalence kernel of an [[Injective function|injection]] is the [[identity relation]].\n\n=== Partition ===\n{{main|Partition of a set}}\nA '''partition''' of ''X'' is a set ''P'' of nonempty subsets of ''X'', such that every element of ''X'' is an element of a single element of ''P''. Each element of ''P'' is a ''cell'' of the partition. Moreover, the elements of ''P'' are [[pairwise disjoint]] and their [[Union (set theory)|union]] is ''X''.\n\n==== Counting possible partitions ====\nLet ''X'' be a finite set with ''n'' elements. Since every equivalence relation over ''X'' corresponds to a partition of ''X'', and vice versa, the number of possible equivalence relations on ''X'' equals the number of distinct partitions of ''X'', which is the ''n''th [[Bell numbers|Bell number]] ''B<sub>n</sub>'':\n: <math>B_n = \\frac{1}{e}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{k^n}{k!},</math>\nwhere the [[Dobinski's formula|above]] is one of the ways to write the ''n''th [[Bell number]].\n\n==Fundamental theorem of equivalence relations==\n\nA key result links equivalence relations and partitions:<ref>Wallace, D.

Since each element of ''X'' belongs to a unique cell of any partition of ''X'', and since each cell of the partition is identical to an [[equivalence class]] of ''X'' by ~, each element of ''X'' belongs to a unique equivalence class of ''X'' by ~. Thus there is a natural [[bijection]] between the set of all possible equivalence relations on ''X'' and the set of all partitions of ''X''.\n\n== Comparing equivalence relations ==\n{{see also|Partition of a set#Refinement of partitions}}\nIf ~ and \u2248 are two equivalence relations on the same set ''S'', and ''a''~''b'' implies ''a''\u2248''b'' for all ''a'',''b'' \u2208 ''S'', then \u2248 is said to be a '''coarser''' relation than ~, and ~ is a '''finer''' relation than \u2248.  Equivalently,\n* ~ is finer than \u2248 if every equivalence class of ~ is a subset of an equivalence class of \u2248, and thus every equivalence class of \u2248 is a union of equivalence classes of ~.\n* ~ is finer than \u2248 if the partition created by ~ is a refinement of the partition created by \u2248.\n\nThe equality equivalence relation is the finest equivalence relation on any set, while the trivial relation that makes all pairs of elements related is the coarsest.\n\nThe relation \"~ is finer than \u2248\" on the collection of all equivalence relations on a fixed set is itself a partial order relation, which makes the collection a [[geometric lattice]].<ref>{{citation|title=Lattice Theory|volume=25|series=Colloquium Publications|publisher=American Mathematical Society|first=Garrett|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff|edition=3rd|year=1995|isbn=9780821810255}}. Sect. IV.9, Theorem 12, page 95</ref>\n\n== Generating equivalence relations ==\n\nGiven any binary relation <math>A \\subset X \\times X</math> on <math> X </math>,  the '''equivalence relation generated by <math>A</math>''' is the intersection \nof the equivalence relations on <math>X</math> that contain <math> A</math>. (Since <math>X \\times X</math> is an equivalence relation, the intersection is nontrivial.)\n\n*Given any set ''X'', there is an equivalence relation over the set [''X''\u2192''X''] of all possible functions ''X''\u2192''X''. Two such functions are deemed equivalent when their respective sets of [[fixpoint]]s have the same [[cardinality]], corresponding to cycles of length one in a [[permutation]]. Functions equivalent in this manner form an equivalence class on [''X''\u2192''X''], and these equivalence classes partition [''X''\u2192''X''].\n*An equivalence relation ~ on ''X'' is the [[Equivalence relation#Equivalence kernel|equivalence kernel]] of its [[surjective]] [[Equivalence relation#Projection|projection]] \u03c0 : ''X'' \u2192 ''X''/~.<ref>[[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], 1999 (1967). ''Algebra'', 3rd ed. p.&nbsp;33, Th. 18. Chelsea.</ref> Conversely, any [[surjection]] between sets determines a partition on its [[Relation (mathematics)|domain]], the set of [[preimage]]s of [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s in the [[codomain]]. Thus an equivalence relation over ''X'', a partition of ''X'', and a projection whose domain is ''X'', are three equivalent ways of specifying the same thing.\n*The intersection of any collection of equivalence relations over ''X'' (binary relations viewed as a [[subset]] of ''X'' &times; ''X'') is also an equivalence relation. This yields a convenient way of generating an equivalence relation: given any binary relation ''R'' on ''X'', the equivalence relation ''generated by R'' is the smallest equivalence relation containing ''R''. Concretely, ''R'' generates the equivalence relation ''a'' ~ ''b'' [[if and only if]] there exist elements ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> in ''X'' such that ''a'' = ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''b'' = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, and (''x''<sub>''i''</sub>,''x''<sub>''i''+ 1</sub>)\u2208''R'' or (''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>,''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)\u2208''R'', ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''-1.\n\n:Note that the equivalence relation generated in this manner can be trivial. For instance, the equivalence relation ~ generated by any [[total order]] on ''X'' has exactly one equivalence class, ''X'' itself, because ''x'' ~ ''y'' for all ''x'' and ''y''. As another example, any subset of the [[identity relation]] on ''X'' has equivalence classes that are the singletons of ''X''.\n*Equivalence relations can construct new spaces by \"gluing things together.\" Let ''X'' be the unit [[Cartesian square]] [0,1] &times; [0,1], and let ~ be the equivalence relation on ''X'' defined by \u2200''a'', ''b'' \u2208 [0,1] ((''a'', 0) ~ (''a'', 1) \u2227 (0, ''b'') ~ (1, ''b'')). Then the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] ''X''/~ can be naturally identified ([[homeomorphism]]) with a [[torus]]: take a square piece of paper, bend and glue together the upper and lower edge to form a cylinder, then bend the resulting cylinder so as to glue together its two open ends, resulting in a torus.\n\n==Algebraic structure==\nMuch of mathematics is grounded in the study of equivalences, and [[order relation]]s. [[Lattice (order)|Lattice theory]] captures the mathematical structure of order relations. Even though equivalence relations are as ubiquitous in mathematics as order relations, the algebraic structure of equivalences is not as well known as that of orders. The former structure draws primarily on [[group theory]] and, to a lesser extent, on the theory of lattices, [[category theory|categories]], and [[groupoid]]s.\n\n===Group theory===\nJust as [[order relation]]s are grounded in [[Partially ordered set|ordered sets]], sets closed under pairwise [[supremum]] and [[infimum]], equivalence relations are grounded in [[partition of a set|partitioned sets]], which are sets closed under [[bijection]]s that preserve partition structure. Since all such bijections map an equivalence class onto itself, such bijections are also known as [[permutation]]s. Hence [[permutation group]]s (also known as [[group action|transformation groups]]) and the related notion of [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] shed light on the mathematical structure of equivalence relations.\n\nLet '~' denote an equivalence relation over some nonempty set ''A'', called the [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] or underlying set. Let ''G'' denote the set of bijective functions over ''A'' that preserve the partition structure of ''A'': \u2200''x'' \u2208 ''A'' \u2200''g'' \u2208 ''G'' (''g''(''x'') \u2208 [''x'']). Then the following three connected theorems hold:<ref>Rosen (2008), pp.&nbsp;243\u201345. Less clear is \u00a710.3 of [[Bas van Fraassen]], 1989. ''Laws and Symmetry''. Oxford Univ. Press.</ref>\n* ~ partitions ''A'' into equivalence classes. (This is the ''Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations,'' mentioned above);\n* Given a partition of ''A'', ''G'' is a transformation group under composition, whose orbits are the [[partitions of a set|cells]] of the partition\u2021;\n* Given a transformation group ''G'' over ''A'', there exists an equivalence relation ~ over ''A'', whose equivalence classes are the orbits of ''G''.<ref>Wallace, D. A. R., 1998. ''Groups, Rings and Fields''. Springer-Verlag: 202, Th. 6.</ref><ref>Dummit, D. S., and Foote, R. M., 2004. ''Abstract Algebra'', 3rd ed. John Wiley & Sons: 114, Prop. 2.</ref>\nIn sum, given an equivalence relation ~ over ''A'', there exists a [[transformation group]] ''G'' over ''A'' whose orbits are the equivalence classes of ''A'' under ~.\n\nThis transformation group characterisation of equivalence relations differs fundamentally from the way [[lattice (order)|lattices]] characterize order relations. The arguments of the lattice theory operations [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] and [[Join (mathematics)|join]] are elements of some universe ''A''. Meanwhile, the arguments of the transformation group operations [[function composition|composition]] and [[inverse function|inverse]] are elements of a set of [[bijections]], ''A'' \u2192 ''A''.\n\nMoving to groups in general, let ''H'' be a [[subgroup]] of some [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G''. Let ~ be an equivalence relation on ''G'', such that ''a'' ~ ''b'' \u2194 (''ab''<sup>&minus;1</sup> \u2208 ''H''). The equivalence classes of ~&mdash;also called the orbits of the [[group action|action]] of ''H'' on ''G''&mdash;are the right '''[[coset]]s''' of ''H'' in ''G''. Interchanging ''a'' and ''b'' yields the left cosets.\n\n\u2021''Proof''.<ref>Bas van Fraassen, 1989. ''Laws and Symmetry''. Oxford Univ. Press: 246.</ref> Let [[function composition]] interpret group multiplication, and function inverse interpret group inverse. Then ''G'' is a group under composition, meaning that  \u2200''x'' \u2208 ''A'' \u2200''g'' \u2208 ''G'' ([''g''(''x'')] = [''x'']), because ''G'' satisfies the following four conditions:\n*''G is closed under composition''. The composition of any two elements of ''G'' exists, because the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[codomain]] of any element of ''G'' is ''A''. Moreover, the composition of bijections is [[bijective]];<ref>Wallace, D. A. R., 1998. ''Groups, Rings and Fields''. Springer-Verlag: 22, Th. 6.</ref>\n*''Existence of [[identity function]]''. The [[identity function]], ''I''(''x'')=''x'', is an obvious element of ''G'';\n*''Existence of [[inverse function]]''. Every [[bijective function]] ''g'' has an inverse ''g''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, such that ''gg''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''I'';\n*''Composition [[associativity|associates]]''. ''f''(''gh'') = (''fg'')''h''. This holds for all functions over all domains.<ref>Wallace, D. A. R., 1998. ''Groups, Rings and Fields''.  Springer-Verlag: 24, Th. 7.</ref>\nLet ''f'' and ''g'' be any two elements of ''G''. By virtue of the definition of ''G'', [''g''(''f''(''x''))] = [''f''(''x'')] and [''f''(''x'')] = [''x''], so that [''g''(''f''(''x''))] = [''x'']. Hence ''G'' is also a transformation group (and an [[automorphism group]]) because function composition preserves the partitioning of ''A''. <math>\\square</math>\n\nRelated thinking can be found in Rosen (2008: chpt. 10).\n\n===Categories and groupoids===\nLet ''G'' be a set and let \"~\" denote an equivalence relation over ''G''. Then we can form a [[groupoid]] representing this equivalence relation as follows. The objects are the elements of ''G'', and for any two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''G'', there exists a unique morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''x''~''y''.\n\nThe advantages of regarding an equivalence relation as a special case of a groupoid include:\n*Whereas the notion of \"free equivalence relation\" does not exist, that of a [[free object|free groupoid]] on a [[directed graph]] does. Thus it is meaningful to speak of a \"presentation of an equivalence relation,\" i.e., a presentation of the corresponding groupoid;\n* Bundles of groups, [[group action]]s, sets, and equivalence relations can be regarded as special cases of the notion of groupoid, a point of view that suggests a number of analogies;\n*In many contexts \"quotienting,\" and hence the appropriate equivalence relations often called [[Congruence relation|congruences]], are important. This leads to the notion of an internal groupoid in a category.<ref>Borceux, F. and Janelidze, G., 2001. ''Galois theories'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-80309-8}}</ref>\n\n===Lattices===\nThe possible equivalence relations on any set ''X'', when ordered by [[set inclusion]], form a [[complete lattice]], called '''Con''' ''X'' by convention. The canonical [[map (mathematics)|map]] '''ker''': ''X''^''X'' \u2192 '''Con''' ''X'', relates the [[monoid]] ''X''^''X'' of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s on ''X'' and '''Con''' ''X''. '''ker''' is [[surjective]] but not [[injective]]. Less formally, the equivalence relation '''ker''' on ''X'', takes each function ''f'': ''X''\u2192''X'' to its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] '''ker''' ''f''. Likewise, '''ker(ker)''' is an equivalence relation on ''X''^''X''.\n\n==Equivalence relations and mathematical logic==\nEquivalence relations are a ready source of examples or counterexamples. For example, an equivalence relation with exactly two infinite equivalence classes is an easy example of a theory which is \u03c9-[[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]], but not categorical for any larger [[cardinal number]].\n\nAn implication of [[model theory]] is that the properties defining a relation can be proved independent of each other (and hence necessary parts of the definition) if and only if, for each property, examples can be found of relations not satisfying the given property while satisfying all the other properties. Hence the three defining properties of equivalence relations can be proved mutually independent by the following three examples:\n* ''Reflexive and transitive'':  The relation \u2264 on '''N'''. Or any [[preorder]];\n* ''Symmetric and transitive'': The relation ''R'' on '''N''', defined as ''aRb'' \u2194 ''ab'' \u2260 0. Or any [[partial equivalence relation]];\n* ''Reflexive and symmetric'': The relation ''R'' on '''Z''', defined as ''aRb'' \u2194 \"''a'' &minus; ''b'' is divisible by at least one of 2 or 3.\" Or any [[dependency relation]].\n\nProperties definable in [[first-order logic]] that an equivalence relation may or may not possess include:\n*The number of [[equivalence classes]] is finite or infinite;\n*The number of equivalence classes equals the (finite) natural number ''n'';\n*All equivalence classes have infinite [[cardinality]];\n*The number of elements in each equivalence class is the natural number ''n''.\n\n== Euclidean relations ==\n[[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]'' includes the following \"Common Notion 1\":\n\n:Things which equal the same thing also equal one another.\n\nNowadays, the property described by Common Notion 1 is called [[Euclidean relation|Euclidean]] (replacing \"equal\" by \"are in relation with\"). By \"relation\" is meant a [[binary relation]], in which ''aRb'' is generally distinct from ''bRa''. A Euclidean relation thus comes in two forms:\n\n:(''aRc'' \u2227 ''bRc'') \u2192 ''aRb'' (Left-Euclidean relation)\n:(''cRa'' \u2227 ''cRb'') \u2192 ''aRb'' (Right-Euclidean relation)\n\nThe following theorem connects [[Euclidean relation]]s and equivalence relations:\n\n; Theorem\n: If a relation is (left or right) Euclidean and [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], it is also symmetric and transitive.\n; Proof for a left-Euclidean relation:\n: (''aRc'' \u2227 ''bRc'') \u2192 ''aRb'' [''a/c''] = (''aRa'' \u2227 ''bRa'') \u2192 ''aRb'' [''reflexive''; erase '''T'''\u2227] = ''bRa'' \u2192 ''aRb''. Hence ''R'' is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].\n: (''aRc'' \u2227 ''bRc'') \u2192 ''aRb'' [''symmetry''] = (''aRc'' \u2227 ''cRb'') \u2192 ''aRb''. Hence ''R'' is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. <math>_{\\Box}</math>\n\nwith an analogous proof for a right-Euclidean relation. Hence an equivalence relation is a relation that is ''Euclidean'' and ''reflexive''. ''The Elements'' mentions neither symmetry nor reflexivity, and Euclid probably would have deemed the reflexivity of equality too obvious to warrant explicit mention.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apartness relation]]\n* [[Conjugacy class]]\n* [[Equipollence (geometry)]]\n* [[Topological conjugacy]]\n* [[Up to]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Brown, Ronald, 2006.

Thus, the first two triangles are in the same equivalence class, while the third and fourth triangles are each in their own equivalence class.]]\n\nIn mathematics, when the elements of some [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an [[equivalence relation]]) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set {{math|''S''}} into '''equivalence classes'''. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} belong to the same '''equivalence class''' if and only if {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are equivalent.\n\nFormally, given a set {{math|''S''}} and an equivalence relation {{math|~}} on {{math|''S''}}, the ''equivalence class'' of an element {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''S''}} is the set\n\n:<math>\\{ x \\in S \\mid x \\sim a \\}</math>\n\nof elements which are equivalent to {{math|''a''}}. It may be proven from the defining properties of \"equivalence relations\" that the equivalence classes form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of {{math|''S''}}. This partition \u2013 the set of equivalence classes \u2013 is sometimes called the '''quotient set''' or the '''quotient space''' of {{math|''S''}} by {{math|~}} and is denoted by {{math|''S'' / ~}}.\n\nWhen the set {{math|''S''}} has some structure (such as a [[group (mathematics)|group operation]] or a [[topological space|topology]]) and the equivalence relation {{math|~}} is defined in a manner suitably compatible with this structure, then the quotient set often inherits a similar structure from its parent set. Examples include [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient spaces in linear algebra]], [[quotient space (topology)|quotient spaces in topology]], [[quotient group]]s, [[homogeneous space]]s, [[quotient ring]]s, [[quotient monoid]]s, and [[quotient category|quotient categories]].\n\n==Examples==\n* If {{mvar|X}} is the set of all cars, and {{math|~}} is the [[equivalence relation]] \"has the same color as\", then one particular equivalence class consists of all green cars. {{math|''X''/~}} could be naturally identified with the set of all car colors.\n* Let {{mvar|X}} be the set of all rectangles in a plane, and {{math|~}} the equivalence relation \"has the same area as\". For each positive real number ''A'' there will be an equivalence class of all the rectangles that have area ''A''.<ref>{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1989|loc=p. 127}}</ref>\n* Consider the [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2 equivalence relation on the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of [[integer]]s: {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}} if and only if their difference {{math|''x'' &minus; ''y''}} is an [[even number]]. This relation gives rise to exactly two equivalence classes: one class consisting of all even numbers, and the other consisting of all odd numbers. Under this relation {{math|[7]}}, {{math|[9]}}, and {{math|[1]}} all represent the same element of {{math|'''Z'''/~}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 123}}</ref>\n* Let {{mvar|X}} be the set of ordered pairs of integers {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} with {{mvar|b}} not zero, and define an equivalence relation {{math|~}} on {{mvar|X}} according to which {{math|(''a'',''b'') ~ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. Then the equivalence class of the pair {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} can be identified with the [[rational number]] {{math|''a''/''b''}}, and this equivalence relation and its equivalence classes can be used to give a formal definition of the set of rational numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=pp. 77\u201378}}</ref> The same construction can be generalized to the [[field of fractions]] of any [[integral domain]].\n* If {{mvar|X}} consists of all the lines in, say the [[Euclidean plane]], and ''L'' ~ ''M'' means that ''L'' and ''M'' are [[parallel lines]], then the set of lines that are parallel to each other form an equivalence class as long as a [[parallel (geometry)#Reflexive variant|line is considered parallel to itself]]. In this situation, each equivalence class determines a [[point at infinity]].\n\n==Notation and formal definition<!--linked from 'Bracket'-->==\nAn [[equivalence relation]] is a [[binary relation]] {{math|~}} satisfying three properties:<ref>{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 122}}</ref>\n*For every element {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|X}}, {{math|''a'' ~ ''a''}} ([[Reflexive relation|reflexivity]]),\n*For every two elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|X}}, if {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}}, then {{math|''b'' ~ ''a''}} ([[Symmetric relation|symmetry]]),\n*For every three elements {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} in {{mvar|X}}, if {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}} and {{math|''b'' ~ ''c''}}, then {{math|''a'' ~ ''c''}} ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).\n\nThe equivalence class of an element {{mvar|a}} is denoted {{math|[''a'']}} and is defined as the set\n\n:<math>[a] = \\{ x \\in X \\mid a \\sim x \\}</math>\n\nof elements that are related to {{mvar|a}} by&nbsp;{{math|~}}. An alternative notation {{math|[''a'']<sub>''R''</sub>}} can be used to denote the equivalence class of the element {{mvar|a}}, specifically with respect to the equivalence relation {{mvar|R}}. This is said to be the {{mvar|R}}-equivalence class of {{mvar|a}}.\n\nThe set of all equivalence classes in {{mvar|X}} with respect to an equivalence relation {{math|''R''}} is denoted as {{math|''X''/''R''}} and called {{mvar|X}} '''modulo''' {{mvar|R}} (or the '''quotient set''' of {{mvar|X}} by {{math|''R''}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 178}}</ref> The [[surjective map]] <math> x\\mapsto [x]</math> from {{mvar|X}} onto {{math|''X''/''R''}}, which maps each element to its equivalence class, is called the '''canonical surjection''' or the '''canonical projection map'''.\n\nWhen an element is chosen (often implicitly) in each equivalence class, this defines an [[injective map]] called a ''[[section (category theory)|section]]''. If this section is denoted by {{math|''s''}}, one has {{math|1= [''s''(''c'')] = ''c''}} for every equivalence class {{math|''c''}}. The element {{math|''s''(''c'')}} is called a '''representative''' of {{math|''c''}}. Any element of a class may be chosen as a representative of the class, by choosing the section appropriately.\n\nSometimes, there is a section that is more \"natural\" than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called ''[[Canonical form|canonical]] representatives''. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], consider the equivalence relation on the integers defined by {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''b''}} is a multiple of a given integer {{math| ''n''}}, called the ''modulus''. Each class contains a unique non-negative integer smaller than {{math|''n''}}, and these integers are the canonical representatives. The class and its representative are more or less identified, as is witnessed by the fact that the notation {{math| ''a'' mod ''n''}} may denote either the class or its canonical representative (which is the [[remainder]] of the [[Euclidean division|division]] of {{math| ''a''}} by {{math|''n''}}).\n\n==Properties==\nEvery element {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|X}} is a member of the equivalence class {{math|[''x'']}}. Every two equivalence classes {{math|[''x'']}} and {{math|[''y'']}} are either equal or [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Therefore, the set of all equivalence classes of {{mvar|X}} forms a [[partition of a set|partition]] of {{mvar|X}}: every element of {{mvar|X}} belongs to one and only one equivalence class.<ref>{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=p. 74, Thm. 2.5.15}}</ref> Conversely every partition of {{mvar|X}} comes from an equivalence relation in this way, according to which {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}} if and only if {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} belong to the same set of the partition.<ref>{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1989|loc=p. 132, Thm. 3.16}}</ref>\n\nIt follows from the properties of an equivalence relation that\n:: {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}} if and only if {{math|1=[''x''] = [''y'']}}.\n\nIn other words, if {{math|~}} is an equivalence relation on a set {{math|''X''}}, and {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are two elements of {{mvar|X}}, then these statements are equivalent:\n\n* <math>x \\sim y</math>\n* <math>[x] = [y]</math>\n* <math>[x] \\cap [y] \\ne \\emptyset.</math>\n\n==Graphical representation==\n[[File:Equivalentie.svg|thumb|160px|Graph of an example equivalence with 7 classes]]\nAn [[undirected graph]] may be associated to any [[symmetric relation]] on a set {{math|''X''}}, where the vertices are the elements of {{math|''X''}}, and two vertices {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} are joined if and only if {{math|''s'' ~ ''t''}}. Among these graphs are the graphs of equivalence relations; they are characterized as the graphs such that the [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] are [[glossary of graph theory|cliques]].<ref>{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 123}}</ref>\n\n==Invariants==\nIf {{math|~}} is an equivalence relation on {{mvar|X}}, and {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is a property of elements of {{mvar|X}} such that whenever {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}}, {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is true if {{math|''P''(''y'')}} is true, then the property {{mvar|P}} is said to be an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] of {{math|~}}, or [[well-defined]] under the relation {{math|~}}.\n\nA frequent particular case occurs when {{mvar|f}} is a function from {{mvar|X}} to another set {{mvar|Y}}; if  {{math|1=''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) = ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>)}} whenever {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub> ~ ''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, then {{mvar|f}} is said to be ''class invariant under'' {{math|~}}, or simply ''invariant under'' {{math|~}}. This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. Some authors use \"compatible with {{math|~}}\" or just \"respects {{math|~}}\" instead of \"invariant under {{math|~}}\".\n\nAny [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} itself defines an equivalence relation on {{mvar|X}} according to which {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub> ~ ''x''<sub>2</sub>}} if and only if {{math|1=''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) = ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}. The equivalence class of {{mvar|x}} is the set of all elements in {{mvar|X}} which get mapped to {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, i.e. the class {{math|[''x'']}} is the [[inverse image]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This equivalence relation is known as the [[kernel of a function|kernel]] of {{mvar|f}}.\n\nMore generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation {{math|~<sub>''X''</sub>}} on {{mvar|X}}) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation {{math|~<sub>''Y''</sub>}} on {{mvar|Y}}). Such a function is a [[morphism]] of sets equipped with an equivalence relation.\n\n==Quotient space in topology==\n\nIn [[topology]], a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] is a [[topological space]] formed on the set of equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a topological space using the original space's topology to create the topology on the set of equivalence classes.\n\nIn [[abstract algebra]], [[congruence relation]]s on the underlying set of an algebra allow the algebra to induce an algebra on the equivalence classes of the relation, called a [[quotient algebra]]. In [[linear algebra]], a [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] is a vector space formed by taking a [[quotient group]] where the quotient homomorphism is a [[linear map]]. By extension, in abstract algebra, the term quotient space may be used for [[quotient module]]s, [[quotient ring]]s, [[quotient group]]s, or any [[quotient algebra]]. However, the use of the term for the more general cases can as often be by analogy with the orbits of a group action.\n\nThe orbits of a [[group action]] on a set may be called the quotient space of the action on the set, particularly when the orbits of the group action are the right [[coset]]s of a subgroup of a group, which arise from the action of the subgroup on the group by left translations, or respectively the left cosets as orbits under right translation.\n\nA normal subgroup of a topological group, acting on the group by translation action, is a quotient space in the senses of topology, abstract algebra, and group actions simultaneously.\n\nAlthough the term can be used for any equivalence relation's set of equivalence classes, possibly with further structure, the intent of using the term is generally to compare that type of equivalence relation on a set {{math|''X''}} either to an equivalence relation that induces some structure on the set of equivalence classes from a structure of the same kind on {{math|''X''}}, or to the orbits of a group action. Both the sense of a structure preserved by an equivalence relation and the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] under group actions lead to the definition of [[#Invariants|invariants]] of equivalence relations given above.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Equivalence partitioning]], a method for devising test sets in [[software testing]] based on dividing the possible program inputs into equivalence classes according to the behavior of the program on those inputs\n*[[Homogeneous space]], the quotient space of [[Lie group]]s\n*[[Transversal (combinatorics)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first=Carol|last=Avelsgaard|title=Foundations for Advanced Mathematics|publisher=Scott Foresman|year=1989|isbn=0-673-38152-8}}\n* {{citation|last=Devlin|first=Keith|title=Sets, Functions, and Logic: An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|year=2004|publisher=Chapman & Hall/ CRC Press|edition=3rd|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1}}\n* {{citation|last=Maddox|first=Randall B.|title=Mathematical Thinking and Writing|year=2002|publisher=Harcourt/ Academic Press|isbn=0-12-464976-9}}\n* {{citation|last=Morash|first=Ronald P.|title=Bridge to Abstract Mathematics|publisher=Random House|year=1987|isbn=0-394-35429-X}}\n* {{citation|last=Wolf|first=Robert S.|title=Proof, Logic and Conjecture: A Mathematician's Toolbox|year=1998|publisher=Freeman|isbn=978-0-7167-3050-7}}\n\n==Further reading==\nThis material is basic and can be found in any text dealing with the fundamentals of proof technique, such as any of the following:\n*{{citation|last=Sundstrom|title=Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof|year=2003|publisher=Prentice-Hall}}\n*{{citation|last1=Smith|last2=Eggen|last3=St.Andre|title=A Transition to Advanced Mathematics (6th Ed.)|year=2006|publisher=Thomson (Brooks/Cole)}}\n*{{citation|last=Schumacher|first=Carol|title=Chapter Zero: Fundamental Notions of Abstract Mathematics|year=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-82653-4}}\n*{{citation|last=O'Leary|title=The Structure of Proof: With Logic and Set Theory|year=2003|publisher=Prentice-Hall}}\n*{{citation|last=Lay|title=Analysis with an introduction to proof|year=2001|publisher=Prentice Hall}}\n*{{citation|last1=Gilbert|last2=Vanstone|title=An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice-Hall}}\n*{{citation|last1=Fletcher|last2=Patty|title=Foundations of Higher Mathematics|publisher=PWS-Kent}}\n*{{citation|last1=Iglewicz|last2=Stoyle|title=An Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning|publisher=MacMillan}}\n*{{citation|last1=D'Angelo|last2=West|title=Mathematical Thinking: Problem Solving and Proofs|year=2000|publisher=Prentice Hall}}\n*{{citation|last=Cupillari|title=The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs|publisher=Wadsworth}}\n*{{citation|last=Bond|title=Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}\n*{{citation|last1=Barnier|last2=Feldman|title=Introduction to Advanced Mathematics|year=2000|publisher=Prentice Hall}}\n*{{citation|last=Ash|title=A Primer of Abstract Mathematics|publisher=MAA}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline|Equivalence classes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Equivalence Class}}\n[[Category:Algebra]]\n[[Category:Binary relations]]\n[[Category:Set theory]]\n[[Category:Equivalence classes| ]]", "sha1": "ee8nzx13l62dbljry8237ewkhwp75z7"}}, {"title": "Electronic Music", "ns": "0", "id": "9261", "redirect": {"title": "Electronic music"}, "revision": {"id": "783862220", "parentid": "290580120", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:45:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Electronic music]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "0gmr68l7p7dc7p0p5zzzf0p8ifvb07a"}}, {"title": "Entertainment", "ns": "0", "id": "9262", "revision": {"id": "866620240", "parentid": "866619253", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T13:34:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Frietjes", "id": "13791031"}, "comment": "use <gallery> for mobile", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses|Entertainment (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2013}}\n\n'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.<ref>The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&nbsp;213\u201314) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of \"to hold mutually\" or \"to hold intertwined\" and \"to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)\". It also provides words like \"merry-making\", \"pleasure\", \"delight\", as well as \"to receive as a guest and show hospitality to\". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].</ref> Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\n\nThe experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.\n\nAn important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.\n\nSome activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.\n\nThe familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename    = Applause.ogg\n|title       = Applause\n|description = Audience applauding a performance of [[Cavalleria Rusticana]] by [[Pietro Mascagni]] (2011)\n|format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Symposium scene Nicias Painter MAN.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Banqueters playing [[kottabos]] and girl playing the [[aulos]].

This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more \"entertaining\" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more \"educational\". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s \"[[edutainment]]\" or \"[[infotainment]]\". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.<ref>For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.

Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: \"What is the meaning of life?\"; \"What does it mean to be human?\"; \"What is the right thing to do?\"; or \"How do I know what I know?\". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}</ref> and was released world-wide.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]</ref> [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}</ref> An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.

Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing \"may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge.

For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], \"dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators,\" and in it audiences \"enjoyed \"blood sport with the trappings of stage shows\".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment.

For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: \"institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&nbsp;... the order of precedence\", for example, were \"all inherited from&nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi\".<ref name=\"Indian Princes\">{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}</ref> In Korea, the \"court entertainment dance\" was \"originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets.\"<ref name=\"Van Zile\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.</ref>\n\nCourt entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with \"masked dance-dramas\" in Korea, which \"originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners\".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally \"solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion\".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.\n\nIn some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that \"at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]\" (1081\u20131185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.<ref name=Garland>{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800\u20131200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177\u201378}}</ref>\n\nCourt ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to \"dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler\".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as \"for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries\".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called \"slit\" or \"talking\" drums, once \"part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief\", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; \"speak\" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.<ref name=\"Slit Drum\">{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=McGregor>{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613\u2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]</ref>\n\nCourtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], \"thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy\".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}\n\nLike court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people.

For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. \"A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable.

It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.\n\n[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]\nMost forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests.

Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].\n\nIn the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times.

For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}</ref>\n\nMusic is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.\n\nThe wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').\n\nThe instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').\n\n<gallery class=center caption=\"Musical entertainment \u2013 10 types of audience engagement\" widths=180 heights=150>\nFile:Lama orchestra.jpg| '''1''' Traditional instruments used to accompany dance (Tibet, 1949)\nFile:RIAN archive 24089 The youngsters singing.jpg|'''2''' Children's choir providing musical entertainment (Russia, 1979)\nFile:Paris Metro orchestra.jpg| '''3''' Ensemble entertains travellers in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] (2002)\nFile:Boduberu performer.jpg|'''4''' Drummer playing [[Boduberu]] (Maldives, 2010)\nFile:CORO ECCLESIA.jpg| '''5''' Choir and orchestra in [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] setting (Italy, 2008)\nFile:Rouvas fans.jpg| '''6''' Contemporary audience in ancient outdoor stadium (Greece, 2009)\nFile:Jay Chou The Era Singapore 2010 concert.jpg|'''7''' A concert with a 3D enhanced stage (Singapore, 2010)\nFile:Concertkoor Haarlem 19-11-2010 Philharmonie.jpg| '''8''' Concert hall audience (Netherlands, 2010)\nFile:Phoenix ThomasMars1.jpg| '''9''' [[Crowd surfing]] at a concert (France, 2011)\nFile:Music listener.jpg| '''10''' Woman listening privately to music through headphones (Russia, 2010)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Games ===\n{{Main article|Game}}\nGames are played for entertainment\u2014sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.\n\nEquipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics & History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}</ref>  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.\n\n[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely.

Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. \"Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative.\"{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, \"reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure\".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.\n\nAmong [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as \"[[choose your own adventure]]\" can make literary entertainment more participatory.\n\n[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]\n[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}</ref> Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]].

Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.\n\n[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]\nAudiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.\n\n{{Quotation|\"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&nbsp;...

It is \"not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions\".<ref name=Kuhns/> Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.<ref name=Watanabe>{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}</ref> Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.\n\nThe power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones\u2014[[Scheherazade]]\u2014a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East & West|year=2006|publisher=I.B.

For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.\n\nEpic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland & Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',<ref>{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English \u2013  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}</ref> or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}</ref> These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.\n\n<gallery class=center caption=\"Telling stories\" widths=180 heights=150>\nFile:William Blake - Canterbury Pilgrims Picture.jpg|[[William Blake]]'s painting of the pilgrims in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''\nFile:Sultan Pardons Scheherazade.jpg|[[Scheherazade]] telling her stories to King [[Shahrayar|Shahryar]] in ''[[The Arabian Nights]]''\nFile:Wayang golek SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|Telling stories via [[Wayang]] golek puppets in Java\nFile:Tosa Mitsuoki\u2014Portrait of Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|[[Tosa Mitsuoki]] illustrating her ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==== Theatre ====\n{{Main|Theatre}}\n[[File:G Durand Saturday Night at the Victoria Theatre VA.jpg|thumb|Saturday night audience at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Theatre]], London (1872)]]\n[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when \"leading musicians and actors\" performed widely at \"poetical competitions\", for example at \"[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]\".<ref>{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J.

They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as \"lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards.\" There were \"violent confrontations with wild beasts\" and \"performances over time became more brutal and bloodier\".<ref name=\"St Leon\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nAnimals that perform trained routines or \"acts\" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=c. 2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}</ref>\n\nMany contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].\n\nThe use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as \"a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment\" has been tested in a court of law.<ref name=Bronner>An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}</ref> [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history.

It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].<ref>{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}</ref><ref>{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.<ref>For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].</ref>\n\nThere are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the \"circle show\". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''caf\u00e9 busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and caf\u00e9s. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.\n\n==== Parades ====\n{{Main|Parade}}\n[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of parade were \"[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]\"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. \"In the summer of 46&nbsp;[[Before common era|B.C.E.]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|location=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}</ref> In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.\n\nMany religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, \"is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765\u20131954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}</ref>\n\nParades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.\n<gallery class=center caption=\"Parades \u2013 10 types, six cultures\" widths=180 heights=150>\nFile:Triunphus Caesaris plate 6 - Andreani.jpg|'''1''' Triumph of Caesar, Andreani (1588/9)\nFile:Alfred Jacob Miller - Cavalcade - Walters 371940199.jpg|'''2''' [[Alfred Jacob Miller]] ''Cavalcade'' by the [[Snake Indians]] (1858\u201360)\nFile:Edmund Blair Leighton - 1816.jpg|'''3''' Parade from the onlooker perspective (1816)\nFile:William McKinley 1897 inauguration.ogg|'''4''' [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration]] parade of US President [[William McKinley|McKinley]] (1897)\nFile:1945 Eelde Canadezen.jpg|'''5''' Respectful crowd at [[motorcade]] in Canada (1945)\nFile:Anant Chaturdashi.jpg|'''6''' [[Ganesh Visarjan]], Mumbai (2007)\nFile:West Indian Day Parade 2008-09-01 man in costume.jpg|'''7''' Costumes in West Indian Day parade (2008)\nFile:Trooping the Colour March on.JPG|'''8''' Celebratory parade in London before seated audience (2008)\nFile:Red Arrows over the Mall.JPG|'''9''' [[Flypast]] (2012)\nFile:Desfile Portela 2014 (906185).jpg|'''10''' [[Rio Carnival|Festive parade in Brazil]] (2014)\n</gallery>\n\n==== Fireworks ====\n{{Main|Fireworks}}\n[[File:Medell\u00edn-Juegos pirot\u00e9cnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]\n\n[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a \"crowning feature of elaborate celebrations\" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9\u201310 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}</ref> Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays \"inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might.

Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka \"the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}</ref>\n\nThe \"fire, sudden noise and smoke\" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport}}\n[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]\n[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]\n\n[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}</ref> A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}</ref>\n\nAside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}</ref> In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.\n\nThe evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]\u2014an important entertainment in Canada.\n\n=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===\n{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}\n[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.<ref name=Wilson>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851\u20131937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, \"shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday\".<ref name=Moss>{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}</ref> However, in the modern world, \"merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. caf\u00e9s\".<ref name=Moss/>\n\nBy the 19th century, \"expos\" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international.

From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned \"regarding fire safety in nightclubs\" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do \"not necessarily result in lasting effective change\".<ref name=Tubbs>{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}</ref> Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety.

The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named \"lands\". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.\n\nOne of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been.

In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O\u2082 (London)|The O\u2082]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.\n\nTwo of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.\n\nIn the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are \"likely to figure among the leading architectural genres\".<ref name=Sheard>{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.</ref> However, they require \"a whole new approach\" to design, because they need to be \"sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways\".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design \"with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience\".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}\n\n<gallery class=center caption=\"Architecture for entertainment\" widths=180 heights=150>\nFile:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|[[Colosseum]] (70\u201380&nbsp;[[AD]]) Roman venue for mass entertainment\nFile:Palais Garnier's grand salon, 12 February 2008.jpg|The Grand Foyer in the [[Palais Garnier]], Paris (1875), influenced architecture around the world.\nFile:Maracana-predefinicao.jpg|[[Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3|Maracan\u00e3]], Rio de Janeiro, at inauguration (1950) the world's largest stadium by capacity\nFile:The O2 from the air.jpg|[[The O\u2082 (London)|The O\u2082 entertainment precinct]] (2007) London\n</gallery>\n\n=== Architecture as entertainment ===\n[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]\nArchitects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as \"attractions\" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase.

R and R' represent any [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] [[substituent]].]]\n'''Ethers''' are a class of [[organic compound]]s that contain an ether [[functional group|group]]\u2014an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] connected to two [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] groups.  They have the general formula R\u2013O\u2013R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 represent the alkyl or aryl groups. Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same on both sides of the [[oxygen]] atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=ethers|file=E02221}}</ref> A typical example of the first group is the [[solvent]] and [[anesthetic]] [[diethyl ether]], commonly referred to simply as \"ether\" ({{nobr|CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>}}). Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lignin]].\n\n==Structure and bonding==\nEthers feature C\u2013O\u2013C linkage defined by a [[Molecular geometry#Bonding|bond angle]] of about 110\u00b0 and C\u2013O distances of about 140&nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]]. The barrier to rotation about the C\u2013O bonds is low.  The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the hybridization at oxygen is sp<sup>3</sup>.\n\nOxygen is more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon, thus the hydrogens alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. They are far less acidic than hydrogens alpha to carbonyl groups (such as in [[ketones]] or [[aldehydes]]), however.\n\n:Depending on the groups at R and R\u2032, ethers are classified into two types:\n\n# Simple ethers or symmetrical ethers; e.g., [[diethyl ether]], [[dimethyl ether]], etc.\n# Mixed ethers or asymmetrical ethers; e.g., [[methoxyethane|methyl ethyl ether]], [[Methoxybenzene|methyl phenyl ether]], etc.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn the [[IUPAC nomenclature]] system, ethers are named using the general formula ''\"alkoxyalkane\"'', for example CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>3</sub> is [[methoxyethane]]. If the ether is part of a more complex molecule, it is described as an alkoxy substituent, so \u2013OCH<sub>3</sub> would be considered a ''\"[[methoxy]]-\"'' group. The simpler [[alkyl]] radical is written in front, so CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> would be given as ''methoxy''(CH<sub>3</sub>O)''ethane''(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>).\n\n===Trivial name===\nIUPAC rules are often not followed for simple ethers. The trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by \"ether\".  For example, ethyl methyl ether (CH<sub>3</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), diphenylether (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. Diethyl ether is simply called \"ether\", but was once called ''sweet oil of vitriol''. Methyl phenyl ether is [[anisole]], because it was originally found in [[aniseed]]. The [[aromatic]] ethers include [[furan]]s. [[Acetal]]s (\u03b1-alkoxy ethers R\u2013CH(\u2013OR)\u2013O\u2013R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.\n\n===Polyethers===\nPolyethers are compounds with more than one ether group.\n\nThe [[crown ether]]s are examples of small polyethers. Some toxins produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s such as [[brevetoxin]] and [[ciguatoxin]] are extremely large and are known as ''cyclic'' or ''ladder'' polyethers.\n\nPolyether generally refers to [[polymer]]s which contain the ether functional group in their main chain. The term [[polyol|glycol]] is reserved for low to medium range [[molar mass]] polymer when the nature of the [[end-group]], which is usually a [[hydroxyl]] group, still matters. The term \"oxide\" or other terms are used for high molar mass polymer when end-groups no longer affect polymer properties.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Aliphatic polyethers\n|-\n!

The difference in the boiling points of the ethers and their isomeric alcohols becomes lower as the carbon chains become longer, as the [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] interactions of the extended carbon chain dominates over the presence of hydrogen bonding.\n\nEthers are slightly polar. The C\u2013O\u2013C bond angle in the functional group is about 110\u00b0, and the C\u2013O dipoles do not cancel out. Ethers are more polar than alkenes but not as polar as alcohols, esters, or [[amide]]s of comparable structure. The presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding with water molecules possible.\n\nCyclic ethers such as [[tetrahydrofuran]] and [[1,4-dioxane]] are miscible in water because of the more exposed oxygen atom for hydrogen bonding as compared to linear [[aliphatic]] ethers.\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ffdead;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | Selected data about some alkyl ethers\n|-\n!

The reaction is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and [[aldehyde]]s. In addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form peroxides, it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any peroxides that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid.  The presence of peroxide in old samples of ethers may be detected by shaking them with freshly prepared solution of a FeSO4 followed by addition of KSCN.  Appearance of blood red color indicates presence of peroxides.\n\n===Lewis bases===\nEthers serve as [[Lewis base]]s and Bronsted bases. Strong acids protonate the oxygen to give \"oxonium ions\". For instance, diethyl ether forms a complex with [[boron trifluoride]], i.e. diethyl etherate (BF<sub>3</sub>\u00b7OEt<sub>2</sub>). Ethers also coordinate to the [[magnesium|Mg]](II) center in [[Grignard reagent]]s.\n\n===Alpha-halogenation===\nThis reactivity is similar to the tendency of ethers with alpha hydrogen atoms to form peroxides. Reaction with chlorine produces alpha-chloroethers.\n\n==Synthesis==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]]-->\nEthers can be prepared in the laboratory in several different ways.\n\n===Dehydration of alcohols===\nThe [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[alcohol]]s affords ethers:\n: 2 R\u2013OH \u2192 R\u2013O\u2013R + [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] at high temperature\n\n[[Image:Symm2.svg|507px|center]]\n\n<ref>{{cite book |title=Organic chemistry |last1=Clayden |last2=Greeves |last3=Warren |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-850346-0 |page=129}}</ref>\nThis direct nucleophilic substitution reaction requires elevated temperatures (about 125&nbsp;\u00b0C). The reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. The method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not unsymmetrical ethers, since either OH can be protonated, which would give a mixture of products. Diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. Cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. Elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol:\n: R\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>(OH) \u2192 R\u2013CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible with delicate molecules. Several milder methods exist to produce ethers.\n\n===Williamson ether synthesis===\n[[Nucleophilic displacement]] of [[alkyl halide]]s by [[alkoxide]]s\n: R\u2013ONa + R\u2032\u2013X   \u2192   R\u2013O\u2013R\u2032 + Na[[Halide|X]]\nThis reaction is called the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]. It involves treatment of a parent [[alcohol]] with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable [[leaving group]] (R\u2013X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include [[iodide]], [[bromide]], or [[sulfonate]]s. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. [[bromobenzene]], see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.\n\nIn a related reaction, alkyl halides undergo nucleophilic displacement by [[phenoxide]]s. The R\u2013X cannot be used to react with the alcohol. However [[phenols]] can be used to replace the alcohol while maintaining the alkyl halide. Since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] like [[sodium hydroxide]] to form phenoxide ions. The phenoxide ion will then substitute the \u2013X group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an aryl group attached to it in a reaction with an [[SN2|S<sub>N</sub>2]] mechanism.\n\n: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013O<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013O<sup>\u2212</sup> + R\u2013X   \u2192   C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OR\n\n===Ullmann condensation===\nThe [[Ullmann condensation]] is similar to the Williamson method except that the substrate is an aryl halide.  Such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.\n\n===Electrophilic addition of alcohols to alkenes===\nAlcohols add to electrophilically activated [[alkene]]s.\n: [[alkene|R<sub>2</sub>C=CR<sub>2</sub>]] + R\u2013OH \u2192 R<sub>2</sub>CH\u2013C(\u2013O\u2013R)\u2013R<sub>2</sub>\n[[Acid]] [[catalysis]] is required for this reaction. Often, mercury trifluoroacetate (Hg(OCOCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is used as a catalyst for the reaction generating an ether with [[Markovnikov]] regiochemistry.  Using similar reactions, [[tetrahydropyranyl ether]]s are used as [[protective group]]s for alcohols.\n\n===Preparation of epoxides===\n{{main|epoxide}}\n[[Epoxide]]s are typically prepared by oxidation of alkenes.  The most important epoxide in terms of industrial scale is ethylene oxide, which is produced by oxidation of ethylene with oxygen.  Other epoxides are produced by one of two routes:\n* By the oxidation of alkenes with a [[peroxyacid]] such as [[Meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|''m''-CPBA]].\n* By the base intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a halohydrin.\n\n==Important ethers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Image:Ethylene oxide chemical structure.png|50px]]\n| [[Ethylene oxide]]\n| Also the simplest [[epoxide]].\n|-\n| [[Image:Dimethylether chemical structure.svg|90px]]\n|[[Dimethyl ether]]\n|An [[aerosol spray#Propellant|aerosol spray propellant]].

Due to the movement of Earth around the Earth\u2013Moon [[center of mass]], the apparent path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with a period of about [[Orbit of the moon|one month]]. Due to further [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] by the other [[planet]]s of the [[Solar System]], the Earth\u2013Moon [[barycenter]] wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion. The '''ecliptic''' is actually the apparent path of the Sun throughout the course of a [[year]].<ref>\n{{cite book \n | author = U.S. Naval Observatory Nautical Almanac Office\n | editor = P.

With slightly more than 365 days in one year, the Sun moves a little less than 1\u00b0 eastward<ref name=\"celes direc\"/> every day. This small difference in the Sun's position against the stars causes any particular spot on Earth's surface to catch up with (and stand directly north or south of) the Sun about four minutes later each day than it would if Earth would not orbit; a day on Earth is therefore 24 hours long rather than the approximately 23-hour 56-minute [[sidereal time|sidereal day]]. \nAgain, this is a simplification, based on a hypothetical Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so the speed with which the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days.<ref>''Astronomical Almanac 2010'', sec. C</ref> The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the [[equation of time]].<ref>''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), sec. 1.233</ref>\n\n== Relationship to the celestial equator ==\n{{Main|Axial tilt}}\n[[File:Earths orbit and ecliptic.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of [[Earth]]'s [[orbit]] projected in all directions forms the reference plane known as the ecliptic. Here, it is shown projected outward (gray) to the [[celestial sphere]], along with Earth's [[equator]] and [[Earth's rotation|polar axis]] (green). The plane of the ecliptic intersects the celestial sphere along a [[great circle]] (black), the same circle on which the Sun seems to move as Earth orbits it. The intersections of the ecliptic and the equator on the celestial sphere are the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es (red), where the Sun seems to cross the celestial equator. ]]\n\nBecause [[Earth's rotation|Earth's rotational axis]] is not [[perpendicular]] to its [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]], Earth's [[Equator|equatorial plane]] is not [[Coplanarity|coplanar]] with the ecliptic plane, but is inclined to it by an angle of about 23.4\u00b0, which is known as the [[axial tilt|obliquity of the ecliptic]].<ref>''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), p. 733</ref> If the equator is projected outward to the [[celestial sphere]], forming the [[celestial equator]], it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the [[equinox]]es.

Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of the other bodies of the [[Solar System]] cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as ''planetary [[precession]]''. The combined action of these two motions is called ''general [[precession]]'', and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 [[Minute of arc|arc seconds]] (about 0.014\u00b0) per year.<ref>''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), sec. 1.322 and 3.21</ref>\n\n{{Main|Astronomical nutation}}\n\nOnce again, this is a simplification.

This is likely due to the way in which the Solar System formed from a [[protoplanetary disk]]. Probably the closest current representation of the disk is known as the ''[[invariable plane]] of the Solar System''. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1\u00b0 to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6\u00b0 of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the [[Sun]]. The invariable plane is defined by the [[angular momentum]] of the entire Solar System, essentially the [[summation]] of all of the [[orbit]]al motions and [[Rotation#Astronomy|rotations]] of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system.

This specifies the [[ecliptic#Relationship to the equator|mean equinox]] of 4 Jan 2010 0h TT [[ecliptic#Relationship to the equator|as above]], without the addition of nutation.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Eclipses==\n{{main|Eclipse}}\nBecause the [[orbit of the Moon]] is inclined only about 5.145\u00b0 to the ecliptic and the [[Sun]] is always very near the ecliptic, [[eclipse]]s always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the [[Moon]]'s [[orbit]], eclipses do not occur at every [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] and [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]] of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an [[Orbital node|ascending or descending node]] at the same time it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hgU4AAAAMAAJ\n|title=A Treatise on Spherical Astronomy\n|first=Robert S.\n|last=Ball\n|date=1908\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|page=83}}, at [https://books.google.com/books Google books]\n</ref>\n\n==Equinoxes and solstices==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;margin:0em 0 .5em 1em;\"\n|+'''Positions of [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\"|&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" | '''[[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]]'''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" | '''[[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial]]'''\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" \n| longitude\n| [[right ascension]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" | '''[[March equinox]]'''\n| 0\u00b0\n| 0h\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" | '''[[June solstice]]'''\n| 90\u00b0\n| 6h\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" | '''[[September equinox]]'''\n| 180\u00b0\n| 12h\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#F4C2C2\" | '''[[December solstice]]'''\n| 270\u00b0\n| 18h\n|}\n{{main|Equinox (celestial coordinates)}}\n\nThe exact instants of [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are the times when the apparent [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] (including the effects of [[aberration of light|aberration]] and [[nutation]]) of the [[Sun]] is 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0.

As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location. The shape of an ellipse (how \"elongated\" it is) is represented by its [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of a [[circle]]) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1.\n\nEllipses are the [[closed curve|closed]] type of [[conic section]]: a plane curve resulting from the intersection of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] by a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (see figure to the right). Ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections: [[parabola]]s and [[hyperbola]]s, both of which are [[open curve|open]] and [[unbounded set|unbounded]]. The [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a [[cylinder (geometry)#Cylindric section|cylinder]] is an ellipse, unless the section is parallel to the [[Axis of rotation|axis]] of the cylinder.\n\n[[Analytical geometry|Analytically]], an ellipse may also be defined as the set of points such that the ratio of the distance of each point on the curve from a given point (called a [[focus (geometry)|focus]] or focal point) to the distance from that same point on the curve to a given line (called the [[Ellipse#Definition of an ellipse by the directrix property|directrix]]) is a constant. This ratio is the above-mentioned eccentricity of the ellipse.\n\nAn ellipse may also be defined analytically as the set of points for each of which the sum of its distances to two foci is a fixed number.\n\nEllipses are common in physics, astronomy and engineering. For example, the [[orbit]] of each planet in our solar system is approximately an ellipse with the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of the planet{{ndash}}Sun pair at one of the focal points. The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems having two astronomical bodies. The shapes of planets and stars are often well described by [[ellipsoids]]. Ellipses also arise as images of a circle under [[parallel projection]] and the bounded cases of [[perspective projection]], which are simply intersections of the projective cone with the plane of projection. It is also the simplest [[Lissajous figure]] formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s with the same frequency. A similar effect leads to [[elliptical polarization]] of light in [[optics]].\n\nThe name, {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|\u00e9lleipsis}}, \"omission\"), was given by [[Apollonius of Perga]] in his ''Conics'', emphasizing the connection of the curve with \"application of areas\".\n\n== Definition of an ellipse as locus of points ==\n[[File:Ellipse-def-e.svg|thumb|Ellipse: Definition]]\n[[File:Ellipse-def-dc.svg|thumb|Ellipse: definition with director circle]]\nAn ellipse can be defined geometrically as a set of points ([[locus of points]]) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n* An '''ellipse''' can be defined using two fixed points, <math>F_1</math>, <math>F_2</math>, called the '''foci''' and a distance, usually denoted <math>2a</math>. The ellipse defined with <math>F_1</math>, <math>F_2</math> and <math>2a</math> is the set of points <math>P</math> such that the sum of the distances <math>|PF_1|,\\ |PF_2|</math> is constant and equal to <math>2a</math>. In order to omit the special case of a line segment, one assumes <math>2a>|F_1F_2|.</math> More formally, for a given <math>a</math>, an ellipse is the set <math>E = \\{P\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid |PF_2| +|PF_1 | = 2a \\}\\ .</math>\nThe midpoint <math>C</math> of the line segment joining the foci is called the '''center''' of the ellipse. The line through the foci is called the '''major axis''', and the line perpendicular to it through the center is called the '''minor axis'''. The major axis contains the '''vertices''' <math>V_1,V_2</math>, which have distance  <math>a</math> to the center. The distance <math>c</math> of the foci to the center is called the '''focal distance''' or '''linear eccentricity'''. The quotient <math>\\tfrac{c}{a}</math> is the '''eccentricity''' <math>e</math>.\n\nThe case <math>F_1=F_2</math> yields a circle and is included.\n\nThe equation <math>|PF_2| + |PF_1 | = 2a</math> can be viewed in a different way (see picture):<br />\nIf <math>c_2</math> is the circle with midpoint <math>F_2</math> and radius <math>2a</math>, then the distance of a point <math>P</math> to the circle <math>c_2</math> equals the distance to the focus <math>F_1</math>:\n::<math>|PF_1|=|Pc_2|.</math>\n<math>c_2</math> is called the '''circular directrix''' (related to focus <math>F_2</math>) of the ellipse.<ref>{{citation|first1=Tom M.|last1=Apostol|first2=Mamikon A.|last2=Mnatsakanian|title=New Horizons in Geometry|year=2012|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|series=The Dolciani Mathematical Expositions #47|isbn=978-0-88385-354-2|page=251}}</ref><ref>The German term for this circle is ''Leitkreis'' which can be translated as \"Director circle\", but that term has a different meaning in the English literature (see [[Director circle]]).</ref> This property should not be confused with the definition of an ellipse with help of a directrix (line) below.\n\nUsing [[Dandelin spheres]] one proves easily the important statement:\n*Any ''plane section of a cone'' with a plane, which does not contain the apex and whose slope is less than the slope of the lines on the cone, is an ellipse.\n\n== Ellipse in Cartesian coordinates ==\n[[File:Ellipse-param.svg|thumb|shape parameters:<br />\na: semi-major axis, <br />\nb: semi-minor axis<br />\nc: linear eccentricity, <br />\np: semi-latus rectum.]]\n\n=== Equation ===\nIf Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the ellipse and the ''x''-axis is the major axis and \n:the ''foci'' are the points <math>F_1=(c,0),\\ F_2=(-c,0)</math>, \n:the ''vertices'' are <math>V_1=(a, 0),\\ V_2=(-a,0)</math>.\nFor an arbitrary point <math>(x,y)</math> the distance to the focus <math>(c,0)</math> is \n<math>\\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + y^2 }</math> and to the second focus <math>\\sqrt{ (x+c)^2 + y^2 }</math>.

There exist various tools to draw an ellipse. Computers provide the fastest and most accurate method for drawing an ellipse. However, technical tools (''[[ellipsograph]]s'') to draw an ellipse without a computer exist. The principle of ellipsographs were known to Greek mathematicians ([[Archimedes]], [[Proklos]]).\n\nIf there is no ellipsograph available, the best and quickest way to draw an ellipse is to draw an [[Ellipse#Approximation by osculating circles|Approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices]].\n\nFor any method described below \n*the knowledge of the axes and the semi-axes is necessary (or equivalent: the foci and the semi-major axis). \nIf this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters. With help of [[Rytz's construction]] the axes and semi-axes can be retrieved.\n\n[[File:Elliko-g.svg|250px|thumb|Ellipse: gardener's method]]\n\n===Pins-and-string method===\nThe characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two [[drawing pin]]s, a length of string, and a pencil. In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points, which become the ellipse's foci. A string tied at each end to the two pins and the tip of a pencil pulls the loop taut to form a [[triangle]]. The tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut. Using two pegs and a rope, gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed\u2014thus it is called the ''gardener's ellipse''.\n\nA similar method for drawing [[Confocal conic sections#Graves's theorem: the construction of confocal ellipses by a string|confocal ellipses]] with a ''closed'' string is due to the Irish bishop [[Charles Graves (bishop)|Charles Graves]].\n\n=== Paper strip methods ===\nThe two following methods rely on the parametric representation (see section ''parametric representation'', above):\n:<math>(a\\cos t,\\;b\\sin t)</math>\nThis representation can be modeled technically by two simple methods. In both cases center, the axes and semi axes <math> a,\\; b</math> have to be known.\n;Method 1\nThe first method starts with \n*a strip of paper of length <math>a+b</math>. \nThe point, where the semi axes meet is marked by <math>P</math>. If the strip slides with both ends on the axes of the desired ellipse, then point P traces the ellipse. For the proof one shows that point <math>P</math> has the parametric representation  <math>(a\\cos t,\\;b\\sin t)</math>, where parameter <math> t </math> is the angle of the slope of the paper strip.\n\nA ''technichal realization'' of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a [[Tusi couple]] (s. animation). The device is able to draw any ellipse with a ''fixed'' sum <math>a+b</math>, which is the radius of the large circle. This restriction may be a disadvantage in real life. More flexible is the second paper strip method.\n\nA nice application: If one stands somewhere in the middle of a ladder, which stands on a slippery ground and leans on a slippery wall, the ladder slides down and the persons feet trace an ellipse.\n\n<gallery widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\" class=\"&quot;float-left\">\nElliko-pap1.svg|Ellipse construction: paper strip method 1\nTusi couple vs Paper strip plus Ellipses horizontal.gif|Ellipses with Tusi couple.

The expression of an ellipse centered at <math>(X_c,Y_c)</math> is\n\n:<math>\\frac{(x - X_c)^2}{a^2}+\\frac{(y - Y_c)^2}{b^2}=1</math>\n\nMoreover, any canonical ellipse can be obtained by scaling the [[unit circle]] of <math>\\reals^2</math>, defined by the equation\n\n:<math>X^2+Y^2=1\\,</math>\n\nby factors ''a'' and ''b'' along the two axes.\n\nFor an ellipse in canonical form, we have\n\n:<math> Y = \\pm b\\sqrt{1 - (X/a)^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{(a^2-X^2)(1 - e^2)}</math>\n\nThe distances from a point <math>(X,Y)</math> on the ellipse to the left and right foci are <math>a + e X</math> and <math>a - e X</math>, respectively.\n\nThe canonical form coefficients can be obtained from the general form coefficients using the following equations:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na, b   &= \\frac{-\\sqrt{2 \\Big(A E^2 + C D^2 - B D E + (B^2 - 4 A C) F\\Big)\\left(A + C \\pm \\sqrt{(A - C)^2 + B^2}\\right)}}{B^2 - 4 A C} \\\\\nX_c    &= \\frac{2 C D - B E}{B^2 - 4 A C} \\\\\nY_c    &= \\frac{2 A E - B D}{B^2 - 4 A C} \\\\\n\\Theta &= \\begin{cases}\n  0 & \\text{for } B = 0, A < C\\\\\n  90^\\circ & \\text{for } B = 0, A > C\\\\\n  \\arctan\\frac{C - A - \\sqrt{(A - C)^2 + B^2}}{B} & \\text{for } B \\ne 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Theta</math> is the angle from the positive horizontal axis to the ellipse's major axis.\n\n== Polar forms ==\n=== Polar form relative to center ===\n[[File:Ellipse Polar center.svg|thumb|right|Polar coordinates centered at the center]]\nIn [[polar coordinates]], with the origin at the center of the ellipse and with the angular coordinate <math>\\theta</math> measured from the major axis, the ellipse's equation is<ref name=Lawrence/>{{rp|p. 75}}\n:<math>r(\\theta)=\\frac{ab}{\\sqrt{(b \\cos \\theta)^2 + (a\\sin \\theta)^2}}=\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{1 - (e\\cos\\theta)^2}}</math>\n\n=== Polar form relative to focus ===\n[[File:Ellipse Polar.svg|thumb|right|Polar coordinates centered at focus]]\nIf instead we use polar coordinates with the origin at one focus, with the angular coordinate <math>\\theta = 0</math> still measured from the major axis, the ellipse's equation is\n:<math>r(\\theta)=\\frac{a (1-e^2)}{1 \\pm e\\cos\\theta}</math>\nwhere the sign in the denominator is negative if the reference direction <math>\\theta = 0</math> points towards the center (as illustrated on the right), and positive if that direction points away from the center.\n\nIn the slightly more general case of an ellipse with one focus at the origin and the other focus at angular coordinate <math>\\phi</math>, the polar form is\n:<math>r=\\frac{a (1-e^2)}{1 - e\\cos(\\theta - \\phi)}.</math>\n\nThe angle <math>\\theta</math> in these formulas is called the '''[[true anomaly]]''' of the point. The numerator <math>a (1-e^2)</math> of these formulas is the '''[[semi-latus rectum]]''' of the ellipse, usually denoted <math>l</math>. It is the distance from a focus of the ellipse to the ellipse itself, measured along a line [[perpendicular]] to the major axis.\n\n==Ellipse as hypotrochoid==\n[[File:Ellipse as hypotrochoid.gif|right|300|thumb|An ellipse (in red) as a special case of the [[hypotrochoid]] with&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''r'']]\nThe ellipse is a special case of the [[hypotrochoid]] when&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''r'', as shown in the adjacent image. The special case of a moving circle with radius <math>r</math> inside a circle with radius <math>R=2r</math> is called a [[Tusi couple]].\n\n== Ellipses as plane sections of quadrics ==\nEllipses appear as plane sections of the following [[quadric]]s:\n* [[Ellipsoid]]\n* Elliptic [[cone]] \n* Elliptic [[cylinder]]\n* [[Hyperboloid of one sheet]]\n* [[Hyperboloid of two sheets]]\n<gallery>\nEllipsoid Quadric.png|Ellipsoid\nQuadric Cone.jpg|Elliptic cone\nElliptic Cylinder Quadric.png|Elliptic cylinder\nHyperboloid1.png|Hyperboloid of one sheet\nHyperboloid2.png|Hyperboloid of two sheets\n</gallery>\n\n== Applications ==\n===Physics===\n==== Elliptical reflectors and acoustics ====\n{{See also|Fresnel zone}}\nIf the water's surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank, the circular waves of that disturbance, after [[reflection (physics)|reflecting]] off the walls, converge simultaneously to a single point: the ''second focus''. This is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci.\n\nSimilarly, if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic [[mirror]], all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus. Since no other smooth curve has such a property, it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse. (In the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center.) If the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an [[ellipsoid]]al mirror (specifically, a [[prolate spheroid]]), this property holds for all rays out of the source. Alternatively, a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear [[fluorescent lamp]] along a line of the paper; such mirrors are used in some [[image scanner|document scanner]]s.\n\nSound waves are reflected in a similar way, so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well. The effect is even more evident under a [[cupola|vaulted roof]] shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid. Such a room is called a ''[[whisper chamber]]''. The same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid, placed facing each other at the proper distance. Examples are the [[National Statuary Hall]] at the [[United States Capitol]] (where [[John Quincy Adams]] is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters); the [[Mormon Tabernacle]] at [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]; at an exhibit on sound at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]]; in front of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] Foellinger Auditorium; and also at a side chamber of the Palace of Charles V, in the [[Alhambra]].\n\n==== Planetary orbits ====\n{{Main article|Elliptic orbit}}\n\nIn the 17th century, [[Johannes Kepler]] discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun [approximately] at one focus, in his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|first law of planetary motion]]. Later, [[Isaac Newton]] explained this as a corollary of his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]].\n\nMore generally, in the gravitational [[two-body problem]], if the two bodies are bound to each other (that is, the total energy is negative), their orbits are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] ellipses with the common [[barycenter]] being one of the foci of each ellipse. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. The orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse, with the other body at the same focus.\n\nKeplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Thus, in principle, the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse. (However, this conclusion ignores losses due to [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]], which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed.)\n\nFor [[elliptical orbit]]s, useful relations involving the eccentricity <math>e</math> are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}e &= \\frac{r_{a}-r_{p}}{r_{a}+r_{p}}=\\frac{r_{a}-r_{p}}{2a}\\\\\nr_{a} &= (1+e)a\\\\\nr_{p} &= (1-e)a\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n*<math>r_{a}</math> is the radius at [[apoapsis]] (the farthest distance)\n*<math>r_{p}</math> is the radius at [[periapsis]] (the closest distance)\n*<math>a</math> is the length of the [[semi-major axis]]\n\nAlso, in terms of <math>r_{a}</math> and <math>r_{p}</math>, the semi-major axis <math>a</math> is their [[arithmetic mean]], the semi-minor axis <math>b</math> is their [[geometric mean]], and the [[conic section#Features|semi-latus rectum]] <math>l</math> is their [[harmonic mean]]. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}a &= \\frac{r_{a}+r_{p}}{2}\\\\\nb &= \\sqrt{r_{a}\\cdot r_{p}}\\\\\nl &= \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{r_{a}}+\\frac{1}{r_{p}}}=\\frac{2r_{a}r_{p}}{r_{a}+r_{p}}\\end{align}</math>.\n\n==== Harmonic oscillators ====\nThe general solution for a [[harmonic oscillator]] in two or more [[dimension]]s is also an ellipse. Such is the case, for instance, of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions; of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic [[spring (mechanics)|spring]]; or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor. Unlike Keplerian orbits, however, these \"harmonic orbits\" have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse, and have fairly simple equations of motion.\n\n==== Phase visualization ====\nIn [[electronics]], the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an [[oscilloscope]]. If the display is an ellipse, rather than a straight line, the two signals are out of phase.\n\n==== Elliptical gears ====\nTwo [[non-circular gear]]s with the same elliptical outline, each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle, turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times. Alternatively, they can be connected by a [[link chain]] or [[toothed belt|timing belt]], or in the case of a bicycle the main [[chainwheel#ovoid chainwheels|chainring]] may be elliptical, or an [[ovoid]] similar to an ellipse in form. Such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable [[angular speed]] or [[torque]] from a constant rotation of the driving axle, or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying [[mechanical advantage]].\n\nElliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears.<ref>David Drew.\n\"Elliptical Gears\".\n[http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/EMAT6680.2003.fall/Drew/Emat6890/Elliptical%20Gears.htm]\n</ref>\n\nAn example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical [[bobbin]] on a [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] machine. The bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base.<ref>{{cite book |first=George B. |last=Grant |title=A treatise on gear wheels |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPoOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72 |year=1906 |publisher=Philadelphia Gear Works |page=72}}</ref>\n\n==== Optics ====\n* In a material that is optically [[anisotropic]] ([[birefringent]]), the [[refractive index]] depends on the direction of the light. The dependency can be described by an [[index ellipsoid]]. (If the material is optically [[isotropic]], this ellipsoid is a sphere.)\n* In lamp-[[laser pumping|pumped]] solid-state lasers, elliptical cylinder-shaped reflectors have been used to direct light from the pump lamp (coaxial with one ellipse focal axis) to the active medium rod (coaxial with the second focal axis).<ref>[http://www.rp-photonics.com/lamp_pumped_lasers.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - lamp-pumped lasers, arc lamps, flash lamps, high-power, Nd:YAG laser<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* In laser-plasma produced [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] light sources used in microchip [[Extreme ultraviolet lithography|lithography]], EUV light is generated by plasma positioned in the primary focus of an ellipsoid mirror and is collected in the secondary focus at the input of the lithography machine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cymer.com/plasma_chamber_detail/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517100847/http://www.cymer.com/plasma_chamber_detail |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Statistics and finance===\nIn [[statistics]], a bivariate [[random vector]] (''X'', ''Y'') is [[elliptical distribution|jointly elliptically distributed]] if its iso-density contours\u2014loci of equal values of the density function\u2014are ellipses. The concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector, in which case in general the iso-density contours are [[ellipsoid]]s. A special case is the [[multivariate normal distribution]]. The elliptical distributions are important in [[finance]] because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance\u2014that is, any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chamberlain, G. |title=A characterization of the distributions that imply mean\u2014Variance utility functions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=185\u2013201 |date=February 1983 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90129-1 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022053183901291}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Owen, J. |author2=Rabinovitch, R. |title=On the class of elliptical distributions and their applications to the theory of portfolio choice |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=38 |issue= |pages=745\u2013752 |date=June 1983 |jstor=2328079 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1983.tb02499.x}}</ref>\n\n=== Computer graphics ===\nDrawing an ellipse as a [[graphics primitive]] is common in standard display libraries, such as the MacIntosh [[QuickDraw]] API, and [[Direct2D]] on Windows.

Thus, the change in slope between each successive point is small, reducing the apparent \"jaggedness\" of the approximation.\n\n;Drawing with B\u00e9zier paths:\n[[Composite B\u00e9zier curve]]s may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy, since any ellipse may be construed as an [[affine transformation]] of a circle.

Elephants are scattered throughout [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include [[Deinotheriidae|deinotheres]], [[gomphothere]]s, [[mammoth]]s, and [[mastodon]]s.\n\nAll elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also called a [[proboscis]]), used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their [[incisor]]s grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their [[column|pillar]]-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including [[savanna]]hs, forests, deserts, and [[marsh]]es. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a [[keystone species]] due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[hyena]]s, and any [[Canidae|wild dogs]], usually target only young elephants (or \"calves\"). Elephants have a [[fission\u2013fusion society]] in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the [[Matriarchy|matriarch]], often the oldest cow.\n\nMales (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased [[testosterone]] and aggression known as [[musth]], which helps them gain [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use [[infrasound]], and [[seismic communication]] over long distances. Elephant [[Elephant cognition|intelligence]] has been compared with that of [[primate]]s and [[cetacea]]ns. They appear to have [[self-awareness]] and show [[empathy]] for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nAfrican elephants are listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as [[Endangered species|endangered]]. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the [[ivory trade]], as the animals are [[Poaching|poached]] for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include [[habitat destruction]] and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as [[working animal]]s in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in [[circus]]es. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and [[popular culture]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"elephant\" is based on the [[Latin]] ''elephas'' ([[genitive]] ''elephantis'') (\"elephant\"), which is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2 (''elephas'') (genitive \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (''elephantos'')),<ref name=\"LSJ\">{{LSJ|e)le/fas|\u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2|ref}}</ref> probably from a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, likely [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].<ref name=etymology>{{cite web|author=Harper, D|title=Elephant|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elephant|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> It is attested in [[Mycenaean Greek]] as ''e-re-pa'' (genitive ''e-re-pa-to'') in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2229199 |title=Ivory and horn production in Mycenaean texts |journal=Kosmos.

The ear flaps, or [[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]], contain numerous blood vessels called [[capillary|capillaries]]. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Narasimhan, A.|year=2008|title=Why do elephants have big ear flaps?|journal=Resonance|volume=13|issue=7|pages=638\u201347|doi=10.1007/s12045-008-0070-5}}</ref> Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Reuter, T.|author2=Nummela, S.|author3=Hemil\u00e4, S.|year=1998|title=Elephant hearing|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=104|issue=2|pages=1122\u201323|url=http://roadecology.ucdavis.edu/%5C/pdflib/Winter2005/Rodwell_Reuter_ele_ear.pdf|doi=10.1121/1.423341|bibcode=1998ASAJ..104.1122R|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207065356/http://roadecology.ucdavis.edu/pdflib/Winter2005/Rodwell_Reuter_ele_ear.pdf|archivedate=7 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Elephant at Okaukuejo, Etosha (2014).jpg|thumb|[[African bush elephant]] spraying water on its body]]\n\n=== Trunk ===\nThe trunk, or [[proboscis]], is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early [[Fetus|fetal]] life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.<ref name=evolution /> The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate [[muscle fascicle]]s, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into [[Dorsoventral|dorsals, ventrals]], and [[Lateral and medial|laterals]] while the latter are divided into [[Transverse plane|transverse]] and [[wikt:radiate|radiating]] muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The [[nasal septum]] is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. [[Cartilage]] divides the nostrils at the base.<ref name=Shoshani74>Shoshani, pp. 74\u201377.</ref> As a [[muscular hydrostat]], the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions.

Unlike most mammals, which [[Tooth development|grow baby teeth]] and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are [[polyphyodont]]s that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9\u201315 years of age, and set four lasts until 18\u201328 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.<ref name=Shoshani70>Shoshani, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\n==== Tusks ====\n[[File:2010-kabini-tusker-bark.jpg|thumb|Asian elephant eating tree bark, using its tusks to peel it off.]]\nThe tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous [[milk teeth]] at 6\u201312 months of age and grow continuously at about {{convert|17|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth [[tooth enamel|enamel]] cap that eventually wears off. The [[dentin]]e is known as [[ivory]] and its [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as \"engine turning\", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral [[calcite]]. Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp]] and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.<ref name=Shoshani71 />\n\nLike humans, who are typically [[Handedness|right- or left-handed]], elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=Shoshani71 /> but those of males tend to be thicker.<ref>Sukumar, p. 120</ref> In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90&nbsp;kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over {{convert|100|lb|kg}}.<ref>\"Still Life\" by Bryan Christy.

The skin around the mouth, [[anus]], and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, [[Sex organ|genitals]] and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.<ref name=Shoshani66>Shoshani, pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\n[[File:Forest elephant group 4 (6987537249).jpg|thumb|An African forest elephant covering its skin with mud]]\nAn elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from [[ultraviolet]] light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular [[mud bath]]s to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]], which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.<ref name=Shoshani66 />\n\n=== Legs, locomotion, and posture ===\n[[File:Elephant Walking animated.gif|thumb|An Asian elephant walking]]\nTo support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals.

In the case of elephants in [[Amboseli National Park]], Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups. These are typically made of two family groups,<ref name=Sukumar175/> which may be closely related due to previously being part of the same family group which split after becoming too large for the available resources.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vaughan, T.; Ryan, J.; Czaplewski, N.|year=2011|title=Mammalogy|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|page=136|isbn=978-0763762995}}</ref> During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the \"central\" and \"peripheral\" subpopulations.<ref name=Sukumar175>Sukumar, pp. 175\u201379.</ref>\n\nSome elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have \"nursing units\" and \"juvenile-care units\". In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a \"joint family\". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group. Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.<ref name=Sukumar175 />\n\n[[File:Asian Elephant at Corbett National Park 15.jpg|thumb|left|Lone bull: Adult male elephants spend much of their time alone or in single-sex groups]]\n\nThe social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14\u201315. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals.<ref name=Sukumar179 /> These elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships.<ref name=\"O'Connell-Rodwell\">{{cite web|author=O'Connell-Rodwell, C.|date=November 2010|title=How Male Elephants Bond|publisher=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=4 June 2017|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-male-elephants-bond-64316480/}}</ref> A [[dominance hierarchy]] exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily.

In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25\u201335 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January\u2013May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June\u2013December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the [[Temporin|temporal gland]] that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his [[penile sheath|sheath]], which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.<ref name=Sukumar100 />\n\nMales become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks.

Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. [[Alloparenting]] \u2013 where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother \u2013 takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old.<ref name=Shoshani106 /> When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.<ref>Kingdon, p. 64.</ref>\n\nFor the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.<ref name=Sukumar126 />\n\nFor its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2\u20134 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older.

Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is especially important for mother\u2013calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<ref>Payne and Langbauer, p. 116.</ref>\n\nVisual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks.

They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the \"freezing behaviour\". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in [[marine mammal]]s like [[toothed whale]]s and sirenians. A unique [[sphincter]]-like muscle around the [[ear canal]] constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.<ref name=\"seismic\">{{cite journal|author=O'Connell-Rodwell, E.O.|year=2007|title=Keeping an \"ear\" to the ground: seismic communication in elephants|journal=Physiology|volume=22|issue=4|pages=287\u201394|doi=10.1152/physiol.00008.2007|pmid=17699882|url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/4/287.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127135124/http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/4/287.full.pdf+html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-27}}</ref> Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes.

[[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]] (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in [[Nubia]]. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the [[classical antiquity|classical period]]. The Greek king [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] took elephants across the [[Alps]] during his war with the Romans and reached the [[Po Valley]] in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.<ref name=\"Shoshani146\">Wylie (2000), pp. 146\u201348.</ref>\n\nOverall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked.

In the [[Modern history|modern era]], elephants have traditionally been a major part of [[zoo]]s and [[circus]]es around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably [[Jumbo]] (1861 \u2013 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus|Barnum & Bailey Circus]].<ref>Shoshani, pp. 168\u201369.</ref> These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.<ref name=Shoshani184>Tuttle, pp. 184\u201388.</ref> As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses.

British Journal for the History of Science 26, pages 171\u2013193 (1993)</ref> He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree (''Stammbaumtheorie'') in articles published in 1853.<ref>{{Cite web  | last = Schleicher| first =  August | title = Darwinism tested by the science of language : Free Download  | url = https://archive.org/details/darwinismtestedb69schl | publisher = Internet Archive  | date = 1869 | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}</ref> ''Stammbaumtheorie'' proved very productive for [[comparative linguistics]], but did not solve the major problem of studying the [[origin of language]]: the lack of [[fossil]] records. Some scholars abandoned the question of the origin of language as unsolvable. Famously, the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Linguistique de Paris]]'' in 1866 refused to admit any further papers on the subject.\n[[Joseph Jastrow]] published a gestural theory of the evolution of language in the seventh volume of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 1886.<ref name=\"Jastrow 1886\">{{cite journal |author=Jastrow J |title=The Evolution of Language |journal=Science |volume=7 |issue=176S |pages=555\u2013557 |year=1886 |pmid=17778380 |doi=10.1126/science.ns-7.176S.555 |jstor=1761264}}</ref>\n\nThe field re-appeared in 1988 in the ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' as a subfield of [[psycholinguistics]]. In 1990, [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] published their paper \"Natural Language and Natural Selection\"<ref name=\"Pinker Bloom 2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|last2=Bloom|first2=Paul|title=Natural language and natural selection|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences| volume=13|issue=4| year=2011|pages=707\u2013727 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061|url=http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~hoole/kurse/hs_evolution/pinkerbloom_bbs_13_4_1990.pdf}}</ref> which strongly argued for an [[adaptationist]] approach to language origins. Development strengthened further with the establishment (in 1996) of a series of conferences on the Evolution of Language (subsequently known as \"Evolang\"), promoting a scientific, multi-disciplinary approach to the issue, and interest from major academic publishers (e.g., the ''Studies in the Evolution of Language'' series has appeared with [[Oxford University Press]] since 2001)<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Oxford Studies in the Evolution of Language | url = http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/language/sel.do | publisher = Oxford University Press  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}</ref> and from scientific journals.\n\n==Recent developments==\nEvolutionary linguistics as a field is rapidly emerging as a result of developments in neighboring disciplines. To what extent language's features are determined by genes, a hotly debated dichotomy in linguistics, has had new light shed upon it by the discovery of the ''[[FOXP2]]'' [[gene]].<ref name=\"Scharff 2005\">{{cite journal |author=Scharff C, Haesler S |title=An evolutionary perspective on FoxP2: strictly for the birds? |journal=Curr.

Studies in [[ethology]] have forced researchers to reassess many claims of uniquely human abilities for language and speech. For instance, [[Tecumseh Fitch]] has argued that the [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]] is not unique to humans. Similarly, once held uniquely human traits such as formant perception, combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are now thought to be shared with at least some nonhuman animal species. Conversely, [[Derek Bickerton]] and others argue that the advent of abstract words provided a mental basis for analyzing higher-order relations, and that any communication system that remotely resembles human language utterly relies on cognitive architecture that co-evolved alongside language.\n\nAs it leaves no fossils, language's form and even its presence are extremely hard or impossible to deduce from physical evidence. Computational modeling is now widely accepted as an approach to assure the internal consistency of language-evolution scenarios. Approximately one-third of all papers presented at the 2010 Evolution of Language conference<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Evolang8 - Program | url = http://www.let.uu.nl/evolang2010.nl/evolang8program.html | publisher =  | date = 2010  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}</ref> rely at least in part on computer simulations.\n\n==Approaches==\nOne original researcher in the field is [[Luc Steels]], head of the research units of Sony CSL in [[Paris]] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. He and his team are currently investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This research has been implemented in [[fluid construction grammar]] (FCG), a formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution of language. The approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is claimed to be theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also focuses the researcher in formulating hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretical models often stay very vague.\n\nSome linguists, such as [[John McWhorter]], have analyzed the evolution and construction of basic [[communication]] methods such as [[pidgin]]ization and [[creolization]].<ref name=\"McWhorter 2001\">{{Cite book  | last1 = McWhorter | first1 = John H. | title = The power of Babel : a natural history of language | date = 2001 | publisher = Times Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-4473-3 | oclc = 46564796 }}</ref>\n\n\"Nativist\" models of \"[[universal grammar]]\" are informed by [[linguistic universals]] such as the existence of [[pronoun]]s and [[demonstrative]]s, and the similarities in each language's process of [[nominalization]] (the process of [[verb]]s becoming [[noun]]s) as well as the reverse, the process of turning nouns into verbs.<ref name=\"Deutscher 2005\">{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | date = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}</ref> This is a purely descriptive approach to what we mean by \"[[natural language]]\" without attempting to address its emergence.\n\nFinally there are those archaeologists and evolutionary anthropologists\u2014among them Ian Watts,<ref name=\"Watts 2009\">{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62\u201392}}</ref> Camilla Power<ref name=\"Power 2009\">{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257\u2013280}}</ref> and [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] (co-founder with [[James Hurford]] of the EVOLANG series of conferences)\u2014who argue that 'the origin of language' is probably an insoluble problem.

[[Equation solving|''Solving'' the equation]] consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. Variables are also called '''unknowns''' and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called [[solution (equation)|solution]]s of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variable. A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.<ref>{{cite book\n |chapterurl=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/NT01240/EQUATION_mathematique.htm\n |chapter=\u00c9quation, math\u00e9matique\n |first=Gilles|last=Lachaud\n |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis\n |language=French\n}}</ref><ref>\"A statement of equality between two expressions.

James|de}} (\u00e9d.), Van Nostrand, 1968, 3 ed. 1st ed. 1948, {{p.|131}}.</ref>\n\nAn equation is written as two [[expression (mathematics)|expression]]s, connected by a [[equals sign]] (\"=\"). The expressions on the two [[Sides of an equation|sides]] of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation.\n\nThe most common type of equation is an [[algebraic equation]], in which the two sides are [[algebraic expression]]s.\nEach side of an algebraic equation will contain one or more [[Addition#Notation and terminology|term]]s. For example, the equation\t \n\t\n:<math> Ax^2 +Bx + C = y </math>\n\t\nhas left-hand side <math> Ax^2 +Bx + C </math>, which has three terms, and right-hand side <math> y </math>, consisting of just one term. The unknowns are ''x'' and ''y'' and the parameters are ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''.\n\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (grain for example) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an equation for it to remain true.\n\nIn [[geometry]], equations are used to describe [[geometric figures]]. As the equations that are considered, such as [[implicit equation]]s or [[parametric equation]]s, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of [[algebraic geometry]], an important area of mathematics.\n\n[[Algebra]] studies two main families of equations: [[polynomial equations]] and, among them, the special case of [[linear equations]]. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form ''P''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, where ''P'' is a [[polynomial]], and linear equations have the form ''ax''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[parameter#Mathematical functions|parameters]]. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from [[linear algebra]] or [[mathematical analysis]]. Algebra also studies [[Diophantine equations]] where the coefficients and solutions are [[integers]]. The techniques used are different and come from [[number theory]]. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\n\n[[Differential equations]] are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are ''solved'' by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\n\nThe \"[[=]]\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by [[Robert Recorde]], who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.<ref>Recorde, Robert, ''The Whetstone of Witte'' \u2026 (London, England: Jhon Kyngstone, 1557), [https://archive.org/stream/TheWhetstoneOfWitte#page/n237/mode/2up the third page of the chapter \"The rule of equation, commonly called Algebers Rule.\"]</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\n===Analogous illustration===\n\n[[File:Equation illustration colour.svg|thumb|Illustration of a simple equation; ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' are real numbers, analogous to weights.]]\n\nAn equation is analogous to a [[weighing scale]], balance, or [[seesaw]].\n\nEach side of the equation corresponds to one side of the balance. Different quantities can be placed on each side: if the weights on the two sides are equal, the scale balances, and in analogy the equality that represents the balance is also balanced (if not, then the lack of balance corresponds to an [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] represented by an [[inequation]]).\n\nIn the illustration, ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' are all different quantities (in this case [[real numbers]]) represented as circular weights, and each of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' has a different weight. Addition corresponds to adding weight, while subtraction corresponds to removing weight from what is already there. When equality holds, the total weight on each side is the same.\n\n===Parameters and unknowns===\n{{see also|Expression (mathematics)}}\nEquations often contain terms other than the unknowns. These other terms, which are assumed to be ''known'', are usually called ''constants'', ''coefficients'' or ''parameters''.\n\nAn example of an equation involving ''x'' and ''y'' as unknowns and the parameter ''R'' is\n\n:<math> x^2 +y^2 = R^2 .</math>\n\nWhen ''R ''is chosen to have the value of 2 (''R ''= 2), this equation would be recognized, when sketched in [[Cartesian coordinates]], as the equation for a particular circle with a radius of 2. Hence, the equation with ''R'' unspecified is the general equation for the circle.\n\nUsually, the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''w'', \u2026, while coefficients (parameters) are denoted by letters at the beginning, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', \u2026 . For example, the general [[quadratic equation]] is usually written ''ax''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''bx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. The process of finding the solutions, or, in case of parameters, expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters is called [[Equation solving|solving the equation]]. Such expressions of the solutions in terms of the parameters are also called ''solutions''.\n\nA [[system of equations]] is a set of ''simultaneous equations'', usually in several unknowns, for which the common solutions are sought. Thus a ''solution to the system'' is a set of values for each of the unknowns, which together form a solution to each equation in the system. For example, the system\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n3x+5y&=2\\\\\n5x+8y&=3\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nhas the unique solution ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121, ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\n===Identities===\n\n{{main|Identity (mathematics)|List of trigonometric identities}}\n\nAn '''identity''' is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. Many identities are known in algebra and calculus. In the process of solving an equation, an identity is often used to simplify an equation making it more easily solvable.\n\nIn algebra, an example of an identity is the [[difference of two squares]]:\n\n:<math>x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) </math>\n\nwhich is true for all ''x'' and ''y''.\n\n[[Trigonometry]] is an area where many identities exist; these are useful in manipulating or solving [[trigonometric equation]]s. Two of many that involve the [[sine function|sine]] and [[cosine function|cosine]] functions are:\n\n:<math>\\sin^2(\\theta)+\\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) </math>\n\nwhich are both true for all values of ''\u03b8''.\n\nFor example, to solve for the value of ''\u03b8'' that satisfies the equation:\n\n:<math>3\\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)= 1\\,, </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is known to be limited to between 0 and 45 degrees, we may use the above identity for the product to give:\n\n:<math>\\frac{3}{2}\\sin(2 \\theta) = 1\\,,</math>\n\nyielding the solution for ''\u03b8''\n\n:<math>\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\approx 20.9^\\circ.</math>\n\nSince the sine function is a [[periodic function]], there are infinitely many solutions if there are no restrictions on ''\u03b8''. In this example, the restriction that ''\u03b8'' be between 0 and 45 degrees implies there is only one solution.\n\n==Properties==\n\nTwo equations or two systems of equations are ''equivalent'' if they have the same set of solutions. The following operations transform an equation or a system of equations into an equivalent one \u2013 provided that the operations are meaningful for the expressions they are applied to:\n\n* [[addition|Adding]] or [[subtraction|subtracting]] the same quantity to both sides of an equation. This shows that every equation is equivalent to an equation in which the right-hand side is zero.\n* [[Multiplication|Multiplying]] or [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity.\n* Applying an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] to transform one side of the equation. For example, [[polynomial expansion|expanding]] a product or [[factorization of polynomials|factoring]] a sum.\n* For a system: adding to both sides of an equation the corresponding side of another equation, multiplied by the same quantity.\n\nIf some [[function (mathematics)|function]] is applied to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation has the solutions of the initial equation among its solutions, but may have further solutions called [[extraneous solution]]s. For example, the equation <math>x=1</math> has the solution <math>x=1.</math> Raising both sides to the exponent of 2 (which means applying the function <math>f(s)=s^2</math> to both sides of the equation) changes the equation to <math>x^2=1</math>, which not only has the previous solution but also introduces the extraneous solution, <math>x=-1.</math> Moreover, if the function is not defined at some values (such as 1/''x'', which is not defined for ''x'' = 0), solutions existing at those values may be lost. Thus, caution must be exercised when applying such a transformation to an equation.\n\nThe above transformations are the basis of most elementary methods for equation solving as well as some less elementary ones, like [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\n{{details|Equation solving}}\n\n==Algebra==\n\n===Polynomial equations===\n{{main|Polynomial equation}}\n\n[[File:Polynomialdeg2.svg|thumb|right|220px|The ''solutions'' \u20131 and 2 of the ''polynomial equation'' {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 ''x'' + 2 = 0}} are the points where the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the [[quadratic function]] {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 ''x'' + 2}} cuts the ''x''-axis.]]\n\nIn general, an ''algebraic equation'' or [[polynomial equation]] is an equation of the form\n\n:<math>P = 0</math>, or\n\n:<math>P = Q</math>\n\nwhere ''P'' and ''Q'' are [[polynomial]]s with coefficients in some [[field (mathematics)|field]] (real numbers, complex numbers, etc.), which is often the field of the [[rational number]]s. An algebraic equation is ''univariate'' if it involves only one [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called ''multivariate'' (multiple variables, x, y, z, etc.). The term ''polynomial equation'' is usually preferred to ''algebraic equation''.\n\nFor example,\n:<math>x^5-3x+1=0</math>\nis a univariate algebraic (polynomial) equation with integer coefficients and\n:<math>y^4+\\frac{xy}{2}=\\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\\frac{1}{7}</math>\nis a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers.\n\nSome but not all polynomial equations with [[Rational number|rational coefficients]] have a solution that is an [[algebraic expression]] with a finite number of operations involving just those coefficients (that is, it can be [[Algebraic solution|solved algebraically]]). This can be done for all such equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] one, two, three, or four; but for degree five or more it can be solved for some equations but, as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] demonstrates, not for all. A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see [[Root-finding algorithm]]) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see [[System of polynomial equations]]).\n\n===Systems of linear equations===\n[[File:\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853.gif|thumb|[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]] is an anonymous Chinese book proposing a method of resolution for linear equations.]]\n\nA [[system of linear equations]] (or ''linear system'') is a collection of [[linear equation]]s involving the same set of [[variable (math)|variable]]s.<ref>The subject of this article is basic in mathematics, and is treated in a lot of textbooks. Among them, Lay 2005, Meyer 2001, and Strang 2005 contain the material of this article.</ref> For example,\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 2y             &&\\; - \\;&& z  &&\\; = \\;&& 1 & \\\\\n2x &&\\; - \\;&& 2y             &&\\; + \\;&& 4z &&\\; = \\;&& -2 & \\\\\n-x &&\\; + \\;&& \\tfrac{1}{2} y &&\\; - \\;&& z  &&\\; = \\;&& 0 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nis a system of three equations in the three variables {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}. A '''solution''' to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A [[Equation solving|solution]] to the system above is given by\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\nx &\\,=\\,& 1 \\\\\ny &\\,=\\,& -2 \\\\\nz &\\,=\\,& -2\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nsince it makes all three equations valid. The word \"''system''\" indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.\n\nIn mathematics, the theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental part of [[linear algebra]], a subject which is used in most parts of modern mathematics. Computational [[algorithm]]s for finding the solutions are an important part of [[numerical linear algebra]], and play a prominent role in [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. A [[Nonlinear system|system of non-linear equations]] can often be [[approximation|approximated]] by a linear system (see [[linearization]]), a helpful technique when making a [[mathematical model]] or [[computer simulation]] of a relatively complex system.\n\n==Geometry==\n\n===Analytic geometry===\n[[File:Coniques cone.png|thumb|A [[conic section]] is the intersection of a plane and a cone of revolution.]]\nIn [[Euclidean geometry]], it is possible to associate a set of coordinates to each point in space, for example by an orthogonal grid. This method allows one to characterize geometric figures by equations. A plane in three-dimensional space can be expressed as the solution set of an equation of the form <math> ax+by+cz+d=0</math>, where <math>a,b,c</math> and <math>d</math> are real numbers and <math>x,y,z</math> are the unknowns that correspond to the coordinates of a point in the system given by the orthogonal grid. The values <math>a,b,c</math> are the coordinates of a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by the equation. A line is expressed as the intersection of two planes, that is as the solution set of a single linear equation with values in <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> or as the solution set of two linear equations with values in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3.</math>\n\nA [[conic section]] is the intersection of a [[cone]] with equation <math>x^2+y^2=z^2</math> and a plane. In other words, in space, all conics are defined as the solution set of an equation of a plane and of the equation of a cone just given. This formalism allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a conic.\n\nThe use of equations allows one to call on a large area of mathematics to solve geometric questions. The [[Cartesian coordinate]] system transforms a geometric problem into an analysis problem, once the figures are transformed into equations; thus the name [[analytic geometry]]. This point of view, outlined by [[Descartes]], enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the ancient Greek mathematicians.\n\nCurrently, analytic geometry designates an active branch of mathematics. Although it still uses equations to characterize figures, it also uses other sophisticated techniques such as [[functional analysis]] and [[linear algebra]].\n\n===Cartesian equations===\nA [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] '''coordinates''', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances from the point to two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, that are marked using the same [[unit length|unit of length]].\n\nOne can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in three-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|space]] by the use of three Cartesian coordinates, which are the signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines).\n\n[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is {{nowrap|1=(''x'' \u2212 ''a'')<sup>2</sup> + (''y'' \u2212 ''b'')<sup>2</sup> = ''r''<sup>2</sup>}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are the coordinates of the center {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and ''r'' is the radius.]]\n\nThe invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] ([[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] name: ''Cartesius'') revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[algebra]]. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [[curve]]s) can be described by '''Cartesian equations''': algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2 in a plane, centered on a particular point called the origin, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' satisfy the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 4}}.\n\n===Parametric equations===\n{{main|Parametric equation}}\nA [[parametric equation]] for a [[curve]] expresses the [[coordinates]] of the points of the curve as functions of a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]], called a [[parameter]].<ref>Thomas, George B., and Finney, Ross L., ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley Publishing Co., fifth edition, 1979, p. 91.</ref><ref>Weisstein, Eric W. \"Parametric Equations.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ParametricEquations.html</ref> For example,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx&=\\cos t\\\\\ny&=\\sin t\n\\end{align}</math>\nare parametric equations for the [[unit circle]], where ''t'' is the parameter. Together, these equations are called a '''parametric representation''' of the curve.\n\nThe notion of ''parametric equation'' has been generalized to [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, [[manifold]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] of higher [[dimension of a manifold|dimension]], with the number of parameters being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety, and the number of equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or variety is considered (for curves the dimension is ''one'' and ''one'' parameter is used, for surfaces dimension ''two'' and ''two'' parameters, etc.).\n\n==Number theory==\n\n===Diophantine equations===\n{{main|Diophantine equation}}\nA '''Diophantine equation''' is a [[polynomial equation]] in two or more unknowns for which only the [[integer]] [[Zero of a function#Polynomial roots|solutions]] are sought (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer values). A '''linear Diophantine equation''' is an equation between two sums of [[monomials]] of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] zero or one. An example of '''linear Diophantine equation''' is {{math|''ax'' + ''by'' {{=}} ''c''}} where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are constants. An '''exponential Diophantine equation''' is one for which exponents of the terms of the equation can be unknowns.\n\n'''Diophantine problems''' have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an [[algebraic curve]], [[algebraic surface]], or more general object, and ask about the [[lattice point]]s on it.\n\nThe word ''Diophantine'' refers to the [[Greek mathematics#Hellenistic|Hellenistic mathematician]] of the 3rd century, [[Diophantus]] of [[Alexandria]], who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce [[Mathematical symbol|symbolism]] into [[algebra]]. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called '''Diophantine analysis'''.\n\n===Algebraic and transcendental numbers===\n{{main|Algebraic number|Transcendental number}}\nAn [[algebraic number]] is a number that is a solution of a non-zero [[polynomial equation]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently \u2014 by [[clearing denominators]] \u2014 with [[integer]] coefficients). Numbers such as [[Pi|{{pi}}]] that are not algebraic are said to be [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. [[Almost all]] [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] numbers are transcendental.\n\n===Algebraic geometry===\n{{main|Algebraic geometry}}\n[[Algebraic geometry]] is a branch of [[mathematics]], classically studying solutions of [[polynomial equations]]. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of [[abstract algebra]], especially [[commutative algebra]], with the language and the problems of [[geometry]].\n\nThe fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], which are geometric manifestations of [[solution set|solutions]] of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [[plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, [[cubic curve]]s like [[elliptic curve]]s and quartic curves like [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [[singular point of a curve|singular point]]s, the [[inflection point]]s and the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. More advanced questions involve the [[topology]] of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.\n\n==Differential equations==\n{{main|Differential equation}}\n[[File:Attracteur \u00e9trange de Lorenz.png|thumb|uptight=1.2|A [[strange attractor]], which arises when solving a certain [[differential equation]].]]\nA [[differential equation]] is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] equation that relates some [[function (mathematics)|function]] with its [[derivative]]s. In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation defines a relationship between the two. Because such relations are extremely common, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], and [[biology]].\n\nIn [[pure mathematics]], differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions \u2014 the set of functions that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.\n\nIf a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of [[dynamical systems]] puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many [[numerical methods]] have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.\n\n===Ordinary differential equations===\n{{main|Ordinary differential equation}}\nAn [[ordinary differential equation]] or '''ODE''' is an equation containing a function of one [[independent variable]] and its derivatives. The term \"''ordinary''\" is used in contrast with the term [[partial differential equation]], which may be with respect to ''more than'' one independent variable.\n\nLinear differential equations, which have solutions that can be added and multiplied by coefficients, are well-defined and understood, and exact closed-form solutions are obtained. By contrast, ODEs that lack additive solutions are nonlinear, and solving them is far more intricate, as one can rarely represent them by [[elementary functions]] in closed form: Instead, exact and analytic solutions of ODEs are in series or integral form. Graphical and [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical]] methods, applied by hand or by computer, may approximate solutions of ODEs and perhaps yield useful information, often sufficing in the absence of exact, analytic solutions.\n\n===Partial differential equations===\n{{main|Partial differential equation}}\nA [[partial differential equation]] ('''PDE''') is a [[differential equation]] that contains unknown [[Multivariable calculus|multivariable function]]s and their [[partial derivative]]s. (This is in contrast to [[ordinary differential equations]], which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a relevant [[computer model]].\n\nPDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as [[sound]], [[heat]], [[electrostatics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[fluid flow]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], or [[quantum mechanics]]. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional [[dynamical systems]], partial differential equations often model [[multidimensional systems]]. PDEs find their generalisation in [[stochastic partial differential equations]].\n\n== Types of equations ==\n<!--Linked from [[Simultaneous equations]]-->\n\nEquations can be classified according to the types of [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] and quantities involved. Important types include:\n* An [[algebraic equation]] or [[polynomial]] equation is an equation in which both sides are polynomials (see also [[system of polynomial equations]]). These are further classified by [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]:\n** [[linear equation]] for degree one\n** [[quadratic equation]] for degree two\n** [[cubic equation]] for degree three\n** [[quartic equation]] for degree four\n** [[quintic equation]] for degree five\n** [[sextic equation]] for degree six\n** [[septic equation]] for degree seven\n** [[octic equation]] for degree eight\n* A [[Diophantine equation]] is an equation where the unknowns are required to be [[integer]]s\n* A [[transcendental equation]] is an equation involving a [[transcendental function]] of its unknowns\n* A [[parametric equation]] is an equation in which the solutions for the variables are expressed as functions of some other variables, called [[parameter]]s appearing in the equations\n* A [[functional equation]] is an equation in which the unknowns are [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] rather than simple quantities\n* A [[differential equation]] is a functional equation involving [[derivative]]s of the unknown functions\n* An [[integral equation]] is a functional equation involving the [[antiderivative]]s of the unknown functions\n* An [[integro-differential equation]] is a functional equation involving both the [[derivative]]s and the [[antiderivative]]s of the unknown functions\n* A [[difference equation]] is an equation where the unknown is a function ''f'' that occurs in the equation through ''f''(''x''), ''f''(''x''\u22121), \u2026, ''f''(''x''\u2212''k''), for some whole integer ''k'' called the ''order'' of the equation. If ''x'' is restricted to be an integer, a difference equation is the same as a [[recurrence relation]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*''[[Five Equations That Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics]]'' (book)\n*[[Formula]]\n*[[Formula editor]]\n*[[History of algebra]]\n*[[List of equations]]\n*[[List of scientific equations named after people]]\n*[[Term (logic)]]\n*[[Theory of equations]]\n*[[Cancelling out]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090816161008/http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/winplot.html Winplot]: General Purpose plotter that can draw and animate 2D and 3D mathematical equations.\n* [http://www.wessa.net/math.wasp Mathematical equation plotter]: Plots 2D mathematical equations, computes integrals, and finds solutions online.\n* [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/w8/~andru/relplot Equation plotter]: A web page for producing and downloading pdf or postscript plots of the solution sets to equations and inequations in two variables (''x'' and ''y'').\n* [http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/ EqWorld]\u2014contains information on solutions to many different classes of mathematical equations.\n* [http://www.fxsolver.com fxSolver]: Online formula database and graphing calculator for mathematics, natural science and engineering.\n* [http://www.numberz.co.uk/ES.html EquationSolver]: A webpage that can solve single equations and linear equation systems.\n* [https://www.vcalc.com/app/ vCalc]: A webpage with an extensive user modifiable equation library.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]\n[[Category:Equations| ]]", "sha1": "qdetumig5gr3u1fmds7folunonlqcmk"}}, {"title": "Ethical naturalism", "ns": "0", "id": "9285", "revision": {"id": "862571640", "parentid": "859470096", "timestamp": "2018-10-05T07:21:34Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mcc1789", "id": "12965382"}, "comment": "/* Criticisms */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Ethical naturalism''' (also called '''moral naturalism''' or '''naturalistic cognitivistic definism''')<ref>{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=228}}</ref> is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:\n\n# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.\n# Some such propositions are true.\n# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion.\n# These moral features of the world ''are'' [[reductionism|reducible]] to some set of non-moral features\n\n==Overview==\nIt is important to distinguish the versions of ethical naturalism which have received the most sustained philosophical interest, for example, [[Cornell realism]], from the position that \"the way things are is always the way they ought to be\", which few ethical naturalists hold. Ethical naturalism does, however, reject the [[fact-value distinction]]: it suggests that inquiry into the natural world can increase our moral knowledge in just the same way it increases our scientific knowledge. Indeed, proponents of ethical naturalism have argued that humanity needs to invest in the [[science of morality]], a broad and loosely defined field that uses evidence from biology, primatology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, and other areas to classify and describe moral behavior.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Science of Morality|url=https://www.edge.org/event/the-new-science-of-morality|website=edge.org|publisher=Edge Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=Oct 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/articles/miller.2008.roots-of-morality.science.pdf|accessdate=October 27, 2017|agency=Science Magazine|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nEthical naturalism encompasses any reduction of ethical properties, such as 'goodness', to non-ethical properties; there are many different examples of such reductions, and thus many different varieties of ethical naturalism. [[Hedonism]], for example, is the view that goodness is ultimately just [[pleasure]].\n\n==Ethical theories that can be naturalistic==\n*[[Altruism (ethics)|Altruism]]\n*[[Consequentialism]]\n*[[Consequentialist libertarianism]]\n*[[Cornell realism]]\n*[[Ethical egoism]]\n*[[Evolutionary ethics]]\n*[[Hedonism]]\n*[[Secular ethics#Humanist ethics|Humanistic ethics]]\n*[[Moral skepticism]]\n*[[Natural-rights libertarianism]]\n*[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]\n*[[Utilitarianism]]\n*[[Virtue ethics]]\n\n==Criticisms==\nEthical naturalism has been criticized most prominently by [[ethical non-naturalist]] [[G. E. Moore]], who formulated the [[open-question argument]]. Garner and Rosen say that a common definition of \"natural property\" is one \"which can be discovered by sense observation or experience, experiment, or through any of the available means of science.\" They also say that a good definition of \"natural property\" is problematic but that \"it is only in criticism of naturalism, or in an attempt to distinguish between naturalistic and nonnaturalistic definist theories, that such a concept is needed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=239}}</ref> [[R. M. Hare]] also criticised ethical naturalism because of its fallacious definition of the terms 'good' or 'right' explaining how value-terms being part of our prescriptive moral language are not reducible to descriptive terms: \"Value-terms have a special function in language, that of commending; and so they plainly cannot be defined in terms of other words which themselves do not perform this function\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hare|M.R.|1964|p=91}}</ref>\n\n===Moral relativism===\nWhen it comes to the moral questions that we might ask, it can be difficult to argue that there is not necessarily some level of [[Moral relativism|meta-ethical relativism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} \u2013 and failure to address this matter is criticized as [[ethnocentrism]]. [[File:The punishment of Bessus by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Could torture under certain conditions be \"wrong\" for a species?]]\n\nAs a broad example of relativism, we would no doubt see very different moral systems in an alien race that can only survive by occasionally ingesting one another. As a narrow example, there would be further specific moral opinions for each individual of that species.\n\nSome forms of [[moral realism]] are compatible with some degree of meta-ethical relativism. This argument rests on the assumption that one can have a \"moral\" discussion on various scales; that is, what is \"good\" for: a certain part of your being (leaving open the possibility of conflicting motives), you as a single individual, your family, your society, your species, your type of species. For example, a [[moral universalism|moral universalist]] (and certainly an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]]) might argue that, just as one can discuss what is 'good and evil' at an individual's level, so too can one make certain \"moral\" propositions with truth values relative at the level of the species. In other words, the moral relativist need not deem ''all'' moral propositions as necessarily subjective. The answer to \"''is free speech normally good for human societies?''\" is relative in a sense, but the moral realist would argue that an individual can be incorrect in this matter. This may be the philosophical equivalent of the more pragmatic arguments made by some scientists.\n\n===Moral nihilism===\n[[Moral nihilism|Moral nihilists]] maintain that any talk of an objective morality is incoherent and better off using other terms. Proponents of [[Science of morality|moral science]] like Ronald A. Lindsay have counter-argued that their way of understanding \"morality\" as a practical enterprise is the way we ought to have understood it in the first place. He holds the position that the alternative seems to be the elaborate philosophical reduction of the word \"moral\" into a vacuous, useless term.<ref name=Ron>[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/centerstage/episodes/episode_24_bioethics_and_public_policy_part_1 Center Stage | Episode 24 \u2013 Bioethics and Public Policy, Part 1].

Conversely, Harris maintains that the fact-value distinction is a confusion, proposing that values are really a certain kind of fact. Specifically, Harris suggests that values amount to empirical statements about \"the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society\". He argues that there are objective answers to moral questions, even if some are difficult or impossible to possess in practice. In this way, he says, science can tell us what to value. Harris adds that we do not demand absolute certainty from predictions in physics so we should not demand that of a science studying morality (see ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'').\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Other sources==\n* {{cite book |last=Garner |first=Richard T. |first2=Bernard |last2=Rosen |title=Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics |year=1967 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |oclc=362952 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hare, H.

Ethical non-naturalism stands in opposition to [[ethical naturalism]], which claims that moral terms and properties are reducible to non-moral terms and properties, as well as to all forms of moral [[anti-realism]], including [[ethical subjectivism]] (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), [[error theory]] (which denies that any moral propositions are true), and [[non-cognitivism]] (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all).\n\n==Definitions and examples==\nAccording to [[G. E. Moore]], \"[[goodness and value theory|Goodness]] is a simple, undefinable, non-natural [[property (philosophy)|property]].\" To call goodness \"non-natural\" does not mean that it is [[supernatural]] or [[God|divine]]. It does mean, however, that goodness cannot be reduced to natural properties such as needs, wants or pleasures. Moore also stated that a reduction of ethical properties to a divine command would be the same as stating their naturalness. This would be an example of what he referred to as \"the [[naturalistic fallacy]].\"\n\nMoore claimed that goodness is \"[[definition|indefinable]]\", i.e., it cannot be defined in any other terms. This is the central claim of non-naturalism. Thus, the meaning of sentences containing the word \"good\" cannot be explained entirely in terms of sentences not containing the word \"good.\" One cannot substitute words referring to [[pleasure]], needs or anything else in place of \"good.\"\n\nSome properties, such as hardness, roundness and dampness, are clearly natural properties. We encounter them in the real world and can [[perception|perceive]] them. On the other hand, other properties, such as being good and being right, are not so obvious. A great novel is considered to be a good thing; goodness may be said to be a property of that novel. Paying one's debts and telling the truth are generally held to be right things to do; rightness may be said to be a property of certain human [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]]s.\n\nHowever, these two types of property are quite different. Those natural properties, such as hardness and roundness, can be perceived and encountered in the real world. On the other hand, it is not immediately clear how to physically see, touch or measure the goodness of a novel or the rightness of an action.\n\n==A difficult question==\nMoore did not consider goodness and rightness to be natural properties, i.e., they cannot be defined in terms of any natural properties. How, then, can we know that anything is good and how can we distinguish good from bad? \n\nMoral epistemology, the part of epistemology (and/or ethics) that studies how we know moral facts and how moral beliefs are justified, has proposed an answer. British epistemologists, following Moore, suggested that humans have a special [[Aptitude|faculty]], a faculty of moral [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], which tells us what is good and bad, right and wrong. \n\n[[ethical intuitionism|Ethical intuitionists]] assert that, if we see a good person or a right action, and our faculty of moral intuition is sufficiently developed and unimpaired, we simply intuit that the person is good or that the action is right. Moral intuition is supposed to be a [[mental process]] different from other, more familiar faculties like sense-perception, and that moral judgments are its outputs. When someone judges something to be good, or some action to be right, then the person is using the faculty of moral intuition. The faculty is attuned to those non-natural properties. Perhaps the best ordinary notion that approximates moral intuition would be the idea of a [[conscience]].\n\n==Another argument for non-naturalism==\nMoore also introduced what is called the [[open-question argument]], a position he later rejected. \n\nSuppose a definition of \"good\" is \"pleasure-causing.\" In other words, if something is good, it causes pleasure; if it causes pleasure, then it is, by definition, good. Moore asserted, however, that we could always ask, \"But are pleasure-causing things good?\" This would always be an open question. There is no foregone conclusion that, indeed, pleasure-causing things are good. \nIn his initial argument, Moore concluded that any similar definition of goodness could be criticized in the same way.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/moral-non-naturalism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Article]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ethical Non-Naturalism}}\n[[Category:Meta-ethics]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]", "sha1": "p19iqjdosxmfv8aij9qivaa2zwh6ju6"}}, {"title": "Elvis Presley", "ns": "0", "id": "9288", "revision": {"id": "866561415", "parentid": "865246893", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T02:48:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "NapoleonX", "id": "13353774"}, "comment": "/* Childhood in Tupelo */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Elvis}}\n{{pp-semi|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2018}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name         = Elvis Presley\n| image        = Elvis Presley promoting Jailhouse Rock.jpg\n| alt          = Elvis Presley in Jailhouse Rock (1957)\n| caption      = Presley in a publicity photograph for the 1957 film ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]''\n| birth_name   = Elvis Aaron Presley\n| birth_date   = {{Birth date|mf=yes|1935|1|8}}\n| birth_place  = [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], U.S.\n| death_date   = {{Death date and age|mf=yes|1977|8|16|1935|1|8}}\n| death_place  = [[Memphis, Tennessee]], U.S.\n| death_cause  = [[Heart attack]]\n| relatives    = [[Riley Keough]] (granddaughter)\n| resting_place = [[Graceland]]<br />Memphis, Tennessee\n| resting_place_coordinates = {{coord|35|2|46|N|90|1|23|W}}\n| occupation   = Singer, actor\n| spouse       = {{marriage|[[Priscilla Presley]]|1967|1973|reason=divorced}}\n| children     = [[Lisa Marie Presley]]\n| website      = {{URL|elvis.com}}\n| module = {{Infobox musical artist|embed=yes\n | instrument   = {{flat list|\n* Vocals\n* guitar\n* piano\n}}<!--- If you think an instrument should be listed, a discussion to reach consensus is needed first per: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_musical_artist#instrument--->\n | background   = solo_singer\n | genre        = {{flat list|\n* [[Rock and roll]]\n* [[Pop music|pop]]\n* [[rockabilly]]\n* [[Country music|country]]\n* [[blues]]\n* [[Gospel music|gospel]]\n* [[rhythm and blues]]\n}}\n | label        = {{flatlist|\n* [[Sun Records|Sun]]\n* [[RCA Records|RCA (Victor)]]\n* [[His Master's Voice|HMV]]\n}}\n | years_active = 1953\u20131977\n | associated_acts = {{flatlist|\n* [[The Blue Moon Boys]]\n* [[The Jordanaires]]\n* [[The Imperials]]\n* [[Million Dollar Quartet]]\n}}\n}}\n| signature    = Elvispresley-logo.svg\n}}\n\n'''Elvis Aaron Presley'''{{refn|Although some pronounce [[Presley|his surname]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|r|\u025b|z|l|i}} {{respell|PREZ|lee}}, Presley himself used the [[Southern American English]] pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|r|\u025b|s|l|i}} {{respell|PRESS|lee}}, as did his family and those who worked with him.{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=391}}\n\nThe correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate.

Regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural icons]] of the 20th century, he is often [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|referred]] to as the \"'''King of Rock and Roll'''\" or simply the \"'''King'''\".\n\nPresley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], and relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], Presley was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", was released in January 1956 and became a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of [[rock and roll]]. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)|transformative era in race relations]], made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial.\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.\n\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, [[blues]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]], he is the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling solo artist]] in the history of recorded music. He won three competitive [[Grammy Award|Grammys]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1935\u20131953: Early years===\n\n====Childhood in Tupelo====\n\n[[File:Elvis' birthplace Tupelo, MS 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Present-day photograph of a whitewashed house, about 15&nbsp;feet wide.

Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an [[Assembly of God]] church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12\u201314}}\n\nOn his mother's side Presley's ancestry was [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]], with some [[Normans|French Norman]].{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=13, 16, 20\u201322, 26}} Gladys and the rest of the family apparently believed that her great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was [[Cherokee]];{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=301}}{{sfn|Nash|2005|pp=2, 188}} the biography by [[Elaine Dundy]] supports the idea,{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=xv, 13, 16}} but at least one genealogy researcher has contested it on multiple grounds.{{sfn|VOA|2009}}{{refn|In her book ''[[Elvis and Gladys]]'', Dundy also states that Presley's great-great-grandmother Nancy Burdine Tackett was Jewish, citing a third cousin of Presley's, Oscar Tackett.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=21}} However, there is no evidence that the Presley family shared this belief and the syndicated columnist and Jewish genealogist Nate Bloom has challenged the cousin's account, which he calls a \"tall tale\".{{sfn|Bloom|2010}}|name=Tackett|group=lower-alpha}} Vernon's forebears were of [[Germans|German]]{{sfn|Kamphoefner|2009|p=33}} or [[Scottish people|Scottish]] origin.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=60}} Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evincing little ambition.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11\u201312, 23\u201324}}{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=419}} The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of [[Cheque fraud|altering a check]] written by his landowner and sometime employer. He was jailed for eight months, while Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12\u201314}}\n\nIn September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as \"average\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15\u201316}} He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of [[Red Foley]]'s [[country music|country]] song \"[[Old Shep]]\" during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi\u2013Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. The ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang \"Old Shep\". He recalled placing fifth.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17\u201318}} A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else\u2014by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=19}}{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=101}} Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, \"I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}\n\nIn September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade; he was regarded as a [[loner]]. The following year, he began bringing his guitar to school on a daily basis. He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played [[hillbilly music]]. By then, the family was living in a largely Black neighborhood.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23\u201326}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s show on the Tupelo radio station [[WELO]]. He was described as \"crazy about music\" by Slim's younger brother, who was one of Presley's classmates and often took him into the station. Slim supplemented Presley's guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19\u201321}} When his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was twelve years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time, but succeeded in performing the following week.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====Teenage life in Memphis====\nIn November 1948, the family moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. After residing for nearly a year in [[boarding house|rooming houses]], they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the [[Public housing in the United States|public housing]] complex known as the Lauderdale Courts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=32\u201333}} Enrolled at [[Humes High School|L. C. Humes High School]], Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher told him that he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, \"Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me\", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher \"agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally [[bullying|bullied]] by classmates who viewed him as a \"mama's boy\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35\u201338}} In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of [[Lee Denson]], a neighbor two and a half years his senior. They and three other boys\u2014including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny Burnette]]\u2014formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=40\u201341}} That September, he began working as an usher at Loew's State Theater.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=20}} Other jobs followed: Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=43, 44, 49}}\n\nDuring his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis's thriving [[blues]] scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of [[Lansky Brothers]]. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual \"Minstrel\" show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with \"[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]\", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: \"I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music\u2014only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show&nbsp;... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nPresley, who received no formal music training and could not read music, studied and played by ear. He also frequented record stores that provided [[jukebox]]es and listening booths to customers. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other country singers such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46\u201348, 358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47\u201348, 77\u201378}} He adored the music of black gospel singer [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues\u2014of necessity, in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated South]], only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} He certainly listened to the regional radio stations, such as [[WDIA|WDIA-AM]], that played \"race records\": spirituals, blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-heavy sound of [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38\u201340}} Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B. King]] recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular, when they both used to frequent Beale Street.{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=8}}\n\n===1953\u20131955: First recordings===\n\n====Sam Phillips and Sun Records====\n{{see also|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label}}\n[[File:PresleyPromo1954PhotoOnly.jpg|alt=Elvis in a tuxedo|thumb|Presley in a [[Sun Records]] promotional photograph, 1954]]\nIn August 1953, Presley checked into the offices of [[Sun Records]]. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: \"[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist [[Marion Keisker]] what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, \"I sing all kinds.\" When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, \"I don't sound like nobody.\" After he recorded, Sun boss [[Sam Phillips]] asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: \"Good ballad singer. Hold.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62\u201364}}\n\nIn January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun Records\u2014\"I'll Never Stand In Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"\u2014but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows. He explained to his father, \"They told me I couldn't sing.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} Songfellow [[Jim Hamill]] later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.{{sfn|Cusic|1988|p=10}} In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=80}} His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact [[Eddie Bond]], leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving \"because you're never going to make it as a singer\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}\n\nPhillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, \"Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'\"{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work something up with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10\u201311}}\n{{Listen |filename=That's All Right.ogg|title=\"That's All Right\" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a \"lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence.\"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}\n\nThe session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"[[That's All Right]]\". Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open&nbsp;... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'\" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94\u201397}} Three days later, popular Memphis DJ [[Dewey Phillips]] played \"That's All Right\" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer really was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u201301}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] number, [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102\u201304}}\n\n====Early live performances and signing with RCA====\nThe trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air club\u2014Presley still sporting his child-size guitar.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} At the end of the month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108\u201311}} Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}} Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as \"really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}\nSoon after, Moore and Black left their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with Presley regularly, and DJ/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117\u201327, 131}} and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' stage on October 2; after a polite audience response, ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was \"not bad\" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128\u201330}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n====''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances====\nIn November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''\u2014the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127\u201328, 135\u201342}} House drummer [[D. J.

Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a [[C. F.

Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Parker\u2014who claimed to be from West Virginia (he was actually Dutch)\u2014had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from country singer turned Louisiana governor [[Jimmie Davis]]. Having successfully managed top country star [[Eddy Arnold]], Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167\u201368}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6\u201312}} When the tour reached [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], Texas, a 19-year-old [[Roy Orbison]] saw Presley for the first time: \"His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.&nbsp;... I just didn't know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}}  By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a hillbilly.\"{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as [[rockabilly]]. At the time, Presley was variously billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}\n\nPresley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him. They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something.\"{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217\u201319}}\n\nAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley.

The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance, on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of [[Carl Perkins]]\u2019s rockabilly anthem \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\". In February, Presley's \"[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]\", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated, and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}\n\nRCA released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety. There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of [[rock and roll]]: \"Blue Suede Shoes\"\u2014\"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way\", according to critic [[Robert Hilburn]]\u2014and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of [[Little Richard]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[The Drifters]]. As described by Hilburn, these \"were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.\"{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}} It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for 10 weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African-American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B.

Allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a \"new Elvis\" in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang \"Hound Dog\" for less than a minute to a [[basset hound]] wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, \"Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd&nbsp;... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition\".{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=13}} Allen later wrote that he found Presley's \"strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing\" and simply worked him into the customary \"comedy fabric\" of his program.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=270}} Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, \"I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance.\"{{sfn|\"Elvis Presley: 'King of Rock'\"|1956|p=5}} Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=73}} Later that night, he appeared on ''[[Hy Gardner Calling]]'', a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, \"No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.&nbsp;... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.&nbsp;... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?\"{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}}\n\nThe next day, Presley recorded \"Hound Dog\", along with \"[[Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)|Any Way You Want Me]]\" and \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\". [[The Jordanaires]] sang harmony, as they had on ''The Steve Allen Show''; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, \"You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=51}} In August, a judge in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=80\u201381}} The single pairing \"Don't Be Cruel\" with \"Hound Dog\" ruled the top of the charts for 11 weeks\u2014a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.{{sfn|Whitburn|1993|p=5}} Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September.

Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers\u2014a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.{{sfn|Edgerton|2007|p=187}} Actor [[Charles Laughton]] hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} Presley appeared in two segments that night from [[CBS Television City]] in Los Angeles. According to Elvis legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan had opined that Presley \"got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants\u2014so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it's a Coke bottle. ... We just can't have this on a Sunday night.

Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=338}}{{sfn|Gibson|2005}} Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}} More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' that made Presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}\n\nAccompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. Igniting the \"biggest pop craze since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp;... Presley brought rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture\", writes historian Marty Jezer. \"As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;...

The album includes \"Old Shep\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session.

Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience.

In February 1961, Presley performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, on behalf of 24 local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A 12-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} As described by John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley himself over the next half-decade, the album is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis's birthright\".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number one LP. Another benefit concert, raising money for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25, in [[Hawaii]].

Presley, at first, insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein\u2014''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)\u2014were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the 27 movies he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a \"pantheon of bad taste\".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine of them, declared, \"A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"{{sfn|Fields|2007}}\n\nOf Presley's films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The movies' rapid production and release schedules\u2014he frequently starred in three a year\u2014affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that he disliked many of the songs chosen for his films.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the movie albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}} Regardless of the songs' quality, it has been argued that Presley generally sang them well, with commitment.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=66}} Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: \"Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and '[[Rock-A-Hula Baby|Rock-a-Hula Baby]]'.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}\n\nIn the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as \"[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]\" (1961) and \"[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]\" (1962). (\"[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]\", the title track to the 1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later.) But, as with artistic merit, the commercial returns steadily diminished. During a five-year span\u20141964 through 1968\u2014Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (1965), a gospel number recorded back in 1960. As for non-movie albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}\n\nShortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261\u201363}} The flow of formulaic movies and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.\"{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}\n\n===1968\u20131973: Comeback===\n\n====''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special====\n{{Main|Singer Presents...ELVIS}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley 68 Comeback Special.jpg|thumb|alt=Presley, wearing a tight black leather jacket with Napoleonic standing collar, black leather wristbands, and black leather pants, holds a microphone with a long cord.

Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960.

Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked, \"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home.

The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man.\"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Dave Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart\u2014Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963.

He was scheduled to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville.

Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nPresley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (a song that would be his closing number for much of the 1970s).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149\u201350}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''Newsweek'' commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert movie, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts\u2014Presley's first U.S. pop number one in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521\u201322}}\n\n[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas, where she was working as a showgirl. She recalled of their encounter, \"He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.{{sfn|Mason|2007|p=81}}\n\n====Back on tour and meeting Nixon====\nPresley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album ''[[On Stage (Elvis Presley album)|On Stage]]''.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=94}} In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record\u2013breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]].{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=95}} In April, the single \"[[The Wonder of You]]\" was issued\u2014a number one hit in the U.K., it topped the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart, as well. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless $50,000 was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a .45 pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=96}}\n\nThe album, ''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'', produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, \"The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop\u2014perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.\"{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}} After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958.

He asked Nixon for a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts.

The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'' aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia.

Security men came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, \"There's too much pain in me&nbsp;... Stone [must] die.\" His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, [[Red West]], his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, \"Aw hell, let's just leave it for now.

Twice during the year, he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a [[coma]] in his hotel suite after the first incident. Towards the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, semi-comatose from the effects of [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley \"felt that by getting [drugs] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street\".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, in 1974, he undertook another intensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519\u201320}}\n\nPresley's condition declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] remembered Presley's arrival at a [[University of Maryland]] concert: \"He fell out of the limousine, to his knees.

After a December 1973 session that produced 18 songs, enough for almost two albums, he did not enter the studio in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=560}} Parker sold RCA on another concert record, ''[[Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=336}} Recorded on March 20, it included a version of \"[[How Great Thou Art]]\" that would win Presley his third and final competitive Grammy Award.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=381}} (All three of his competitive Grammy wins\u2014out of 14 total nominations\u2014were for gospel recordings.)

Asked if drugs were involved, he declared that \"drugs played no role in Presley's death\".{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} In fact, \"drug use was heavily implicated\" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered \"anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy\". A pair of lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported \"fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651\u201353}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] conducted a review of the reports and concluded that a combination of central nervous system depressants had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: \"Elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time.

But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call.\"{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}\n\nThe competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Dr. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was [[cardiac arrhythmia]], a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}} While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability for his death, the facts were startling: \"In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in Elvis's name.\" His license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\nIn 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Dr. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, \"There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.\"{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Dr. Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff \"could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks.\" One of the examiners, Dr. E. Eric Muirhead \"could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments.\"{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11\u201314}} Writer Frank Coffey thought Elvis's death was due to \"a phenomenon called the [[Valsalva maneuver]] (essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage\u2014plausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)\".{{sfn|Coffey|1997|p=247}} In similar terms, Dr. Dan Warlick, who was present at the autopsy, \"believes Presley's chronic constipation\u2014the result of years of prescription drug abuse and high-fat, high-cholesterol gorging\u2014brought on what's known as Valsalva's maneuver. Put simply, the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's abdominal aorta, shutting down his heart.\"{{sfn|Wertheimer|1997|p=132}}\n\nHowever, in 2013, Dr. [[Forest Tennant]], who had testified as a defense witness in Nichopoulos's trial, described his own analysis of Presley's available medical records. He concluded that Presley's \"drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that damaged his brain\", and that his death was due in part to a toxic reaction to codeine\u2014exacerbated by an undetected liver enzyme defect\u2014which can cause sudden cardiac arrhythmia.{{sfn|Tennant|2013}} DNA analysis in 2014 of a hair sample purported to be Presley's found evidence of genetic variants that can lead to glaucoma, migraines, and obesity; a crucial variant associated with the heart-muscle disease [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] was also identified.{{sfn|Guardian|2014}}\n\n===Since 1977===\nBetween 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top ten country hits.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Graceland was opened to the public in 1982.

Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, \"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\"{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}\n\n===Musical styles and genres===\n[[File:Elvis Presley and the Jordanaires 1957.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis and the Jordanaires|Presley with his longtime vocal backup group, the [[Jordanaires]], March 1957]]\nPresley was a central figure in the development of [[rockabilly]], according to music historians. \"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label\", writes Craig Morrison.{{sfn|Morrison|1996|p=x}} Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \"essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction\": \"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} In \"That's All Right\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \"a combination of [[Merle Travis]]\u2013style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\"{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \"rockabilly's originator\",{{sfn|Charlton|2006|p=103}} [[Carl Perkins]] has explicitly stated that \"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\"{{sfn|Jancik|1998|p=16}} and, according to Michael Campbell, \"[[Bill Haley]] recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=161}} In Moore's view, too, \"It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1989|p=104}}\n\nAt RCA, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard \"[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]\" at Sun to the country ballad \"How's the World Treating You?\" on his second LP to the blues of \"Santa Claus Is Back In Town\". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.\n{{Listen |filename=Run On.ogg|title=\"Run On\" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition.

His first post-Army single, the number one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of this shift. RCA publicity materials referred to its \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it \"upbeat pop\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five \"[[She's Not You]]\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop\".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as \"[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]\" and \"[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan \"[[\u2019O sole mio]]\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142\u201343}}\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He would record few new straight-ahead rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they were \"hard to find\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis In Memphis'', as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected his new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}\n\n===Vocal style and range===\nThe developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", Presley \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" he shows \"how masterful his relaxed style really is.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line {{\"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the CBS program ''Stage Show'', January 16, 1956]]\nJorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions\", as Presley \"crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand By Me]]\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance,\" but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, \"he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: \"The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}\n\nMarsh praises his 1968 reading of \"[[U.S. Male]]\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on \"In the Ghetto\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of his voice\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of \"almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}\n\nMusic critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that \"Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]].  An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}  He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, \"from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat.  Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}  In Pleasants' view, his voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy\".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}  Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\"{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}\n\n==Public image==\n\n===Racial issues===\nWhen Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on Memphis's [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u201301}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley, \"the rock 'n' roll phenomenon\", \"cracked Memphis's segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its \"colored night\".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults, according to ''Billboard''{{'}}s Arnold Shaw, \"did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"{{sfn|Denisoff|1975|p=22}}\n\nDespite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had at some point announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.\" A journalist with the national African-American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''[[Jailhouse Rock (1957 film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: \"I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like [[Fats Domino]] can. I know that.\"{{sfn|Williams|2012}} Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, \"He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}} The identification of Presley with racism\u2014either personally or symbolically\u2014was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\", by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]: \"Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain\".{{sfn|Myrie|2009|pp=123\u201324}}\n\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}{{sfn|Myrie|2009|pp=123\u201324}} Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was [[Jackie Wilson]], who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.\"{{sfn|Masley|2002}} And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that].\"{{sfn|Osborne|2000|p=207}} Nine years earlier, he had said, \"Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years.

And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\"{{sfn|Ashley|2009|p=76}} His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic [[George Melly]] described him as \"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=58}} In his Presley obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him as \"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58\u201359}} Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.{{sfn|Garber|1997|p=366}}\n\nWhile Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, ''[[Sight and Sound]]''{{'}}s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \"aggressively bisexual in appeal\".{{Sfn|Dyer|1959\u20131960|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the \"orgasmic gyrations\" of the title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\".{{sfn|Farmer|2000|p=86}} In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\"{{sfn|Tasker|2007|p=208}}\n\nReinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from [[Natalie Wood]] in the 1950s to [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1960s to [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the 1970s. [[June Juanico]] of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=109}}\n\n==Associates==\n\n===Colonel Parker and the Aberbachs===\n{{further|Colonel Tom Parker}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker|Presley and Colonel Tom Parker, 1969]]\nOnce he became Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker insisted on exceptionally tight control over his client's career. Early on, he and his Hill and Range allies, the brothers [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], perceived the close relationship that developed between Presley and songwriters [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]] as a serious threat to that control.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=415\u201317, 448\u201349}} Parker effectively ended the relationship, deliberately or not, with the new contract he sent Leiber in early 1958. Leiber thought there was a mistake\u2014the sheet of paper was blank except for Parker's signature and a line on which to enter his. \"There's no mistake, boy, just sign it and return it\", Parker directed. \"Don't worry, we'll fill it in later.\" Leiber declined, and Presley's fruitful collaboration with the writing team was over.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=452\u201353}} Other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for Presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=198}}\n\nBy 1967, Parker's contracts gave him 50 percent of most of Presley's earnings from recordings, films, and merchandise.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=248}} Beginning in February 1972, he took a third of the profit from live appearances;{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=304, 365}} a January 1976 agreement entitled him to half of that as well.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=358, 375}} Priscilla Presley noted that \"Elvis detested the business side of his career. He would sign a contract without even reading it.\"{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=188}} Presley's friend Marty Lacker regarded Parker as a \"hustler and a con artist. He was only interested in 'now money'\u2014get the buck and get gone.\"{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=290}}\n\nLacker was instrumental in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer [[Chips Moman]] and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented a significant departure from the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still had to deal with the publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=262\u201365}} Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings,{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=267}} Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=281}}\n\nThroughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States\u2014all of them in Canada, during brief tours there in 1957.{{sfn|Nash|2003|p=186}} In 1968, he remarked, \"Before too long I'm going to make some personal appearance tours. I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I want to see some places I've never seen before.\"{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}} Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his evident unwillingness to apply for a passport.{{sfn|Nash|2003|p=187}} After Presley's death, it was revealed that Parker was born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands; having immigrated illegally to the U.S., he had reason to fear that if he left the country, he would not be allowed back in again.{{sfn|Nash|2005|pp=64, 478}} Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=123}}\n\nParker arguably exercised tightest control over Presley's film career. Hal Wallis said, \"I'd rather try and close a deal with the devil\" than with Parker. Fellow movie producer [[Sam Katzman]] described him as \"the biggest con artist in the world\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=192}} In 1957, [[Robert Mitchum]] asked Presley to costar with him in ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'', which Mitchum was producing and writing.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=125}} According to George Klein, one of his oldest friends, Presley was also offered starring roles in ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=226}} In 1974, [[Barbra Streisand]] approached Presley to star with her in the remake of ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=563\u201365}} In each case, any ambitions Presley may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands or flat refusals. In Lacker's description, \"The only thing that kept Elvis going after the early years was a new challenge. But Parker kept running everything into the ground.\"{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=290}} The prevailing attitude may have been summed up best by the response Leiber and Stoller received when they brought a serious film project for Presley to Parker and the Hill and Range owners for their consideration. In Leiber's telling, Jean Aberbach warned them to never again \"try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process known as Elvis Presley\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}}\n\n===Memphis Mafia===\n{{Main|Memphis Mafia}}\nIn the early 1960s, the circle of friends with whom Presley constantly surrounded himself until his death came to be known as the \"Memphis Mafia\".{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|pp=139\u201340}} \"Surrounded by the[ir] parasitic presence\", as journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] puts it, \"it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor, no-one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open.\"{{sfn|Harris|2006}} [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of Presley's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: \"But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people&nbsp;... all those so-called friends\".{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=339}} In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said, \"[Presley] was his own man.&nbsp;... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2008|p=148}}\n\n[[Larry Geller]] became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike others in the Memphis Mafia, he was interested in spiritual questions and recalls how, from their first conversation, Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties: \"I mean there ''has'' to be a purpose&nbsp;... there's got to be a reason&nbsp;... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=174}} Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which Presley read voraciously.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=175}} Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books on tour.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{further|Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|Cultural depictions of Elvis Presley|Elvis has left the building|List of songs about or referencing Elvis Presley}}\n\n{{quote box\n|quote=I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but&nbsp;... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today.

His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country.\"{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the world.{{sfn|Arnett|2006|p=400}}\n\nPresley's name, image, and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe.{{sfn|Doss|1999|p=2}} He has inspired [[Elvis impersonator|a legion of impersonators]].{{sfn|Lott|1997|p=192}} In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans.{{refn|[[VH1]] ranked Presley No.&nbsp;8 among the \"100 Greatest Artists of Rock & Roll\" in 1998.{{sfn|VH1|1998}} The [[BBC]] ranked him as the No.&nbsp;2 \"Voice of the Century\" in 2001.{{sfn|BBC News|2001}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him No.&nbsp;3 in its list of \"The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time\" in 2004.{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2004}} [[Country Music Television|CMT]] ranked him No.&nbsp;15 among the \"40 Greatest Men in Country Music\" in 2005.{{sfn|CMT|2005}} The [[Discovery Channel]] placed him No.&nbsp;8 on its \"Greatest American\" list in 2005.{{sfn|Discovery Channel|2005}} ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' put him in the top ten of its \"100 Icons of the Century\" in 2005.{{sfn|Variety.com|2005}} ''[[The Atlantic]]'' ranked him No.&nbsp;66 among the \"100 Most Influential Figures in American History\" in 2006.{{sfn|Atlantic|2006}}|name=ranking|group=lower-alpha}} \"Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century\", said composer and conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]]. \"He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything\u2014music, language, clothes.

Elvis's breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.\"{{sfn|New York Times|2002}} Not only Presley's achievements, but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:\n<blockquote>\n\nElvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;...

''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens. ''Billboard'' now states that they yielded just two number ones and a total of two top tens, voiding the separate chart appearances of \"Hound Dog\" and \"I Beg of You\".|name=billboard|group=lower-alpha}} According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]];{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} per ''Billboard''{{'}}s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.{{sfn|Hasty|2008}} Whitburn and ''Billboard'' concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number one hits with 20, and that [[Mariah Carey]] is second with 18.
