He entered [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] as a [[sizar]] and became [[Senior wrangler]] in 1757. He was elected a Fellow of Magdalene and in 1760 [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]], holding the chair until his death. He made the assertion known as [[Waring's problem]] without proof in his writings ''Meditationes Algebraicae''. Waring was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1763 and awarded the [[Copley Medal]] in 1784.\n\n==Early years==\nWaring was the eldest son of John and Elizabeth Waring, a prosperous farming couple. He received his early education in [[Shrewsbury School]] under a Mr Hotchkin and was admitted as a [[sizar]] at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], on 24 March 1753, being also Millington exhibitioner.<ref>{{acad|id=WRN753E|name=Waring, Edward}}</ref> His extraordinary talent for mathematics was recognised from his early years in Cambridge. In 1757 he graduated BA as [[senior wrangler]] and on 24 April 1758 was elected to a fellowship at Magdalene. He belonged to the [[Hyson Club]], whose members included [[William Paley]].\n\n==Career==\nAt the end of 1759 Waring published the first chapter of ''Miscellanea Analytica''. On 28 January the next year he was appointed [[Lucasian professor]] of mathematics, one of the highest positions in Cambridge. [[William Samuel Powell]], then tutor in [[St John's College, Cambridge]] opposed Waring's election and instead supported the candidacy of [[William Ludlam]]. In the polemic with Powell, Waring was backed by [[John Wilson (mathematician)|John Wilson]]. In fact Waring was very young and did not hold the MA, necessary for qualifying for the Lucasian chair, but this was granted him in 1760 by royal mandate. In 1762 he published the full ''Miscellanea Analytica'', mainly devoted to the theory of numbers and algebraic equations. In 1763 he was elected to the [[Royal Society]]. He was awarded its [[Copley Medal]] in 1784 but withdrew from the society in 1795, after he had reached sixty, 'on account of [his] age'. Waring was also a member of the academies of sciences of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] and [[Institute of Bologna Academy of Sciences|Bologna]]. In 1767 he took an MD degree, but his activity in medicine was quite limited. He carried out dissections with [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Richard Watson]], professor of chemistry and later bishop of [[Llandaff]]. From about 1770 he was physician at [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] at Cambridge, and he also practised at [[St Ives, Huntingdonshire]], where he lived for some years after 1767. His career as a physician was not very successful since he was seriously short-sighted and a very shy man.\n\n==Personal life==\nWaring had a younger brother, Humphrey, who obtained a fellowship at Magdalene in 1775. In 1776 Waring married Mary Oswell, sister of a draper in Shrewsbury; they moved to Shrewsbury and then retired to [[Plealey]], 8 miles out of the town, where Waring owned an estate of 215 acres in 1797<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaydon & Lawson|first=A.T. & J.B.|title=A History of Pontesbury|year=1982|publisher=Shropshire Libraries|page=275|isbn=0-903802-23-6}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Waring - Miscellanea analytica, de aequationibus algebraicis et curvarum proprietatibus, 1762 - 717386.tif|thumb|''Miscellanea analytica'', 1762]]\nWaring wrote a number of papers in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', dealing with the resolution of algebraic equations, number theory, series, approximation of roots, interpolation, the geometry of conic sections, and dynamics. The ''Meditationes Algebraicae'' (1770), where many of the results published in ''Miscellanea Analytica'' were reworked and expanded, was described by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] as 'a work full of excellent researches'. In this work Waring published many theorems concerning the solution of algebraic equations which attracted the attention of continental mathematicians, but his best results are in number theory. Included in this work was the so-called [[Goldbach conjecture]] (every even integer is the sum of two primes), and also the following conjecture: every odd integer is a prime or the sum of three primes. Lagrange had proved that every positive integer is the [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|sum of not more than four squares]]; Waring suggested that every positive integer is either a cube or the sum of not more than nine cubes. He also advanced the hypothesis that every positive integer is either a biquadrate (fourth power) or the sum of not more than nineteen biquadrates. These hypotheses form what is known as [[Waring's problem]]. He also published a theorem, due to his friend John Wilson, concerning prime numbers; it was later proven rigorously by Lagrange.\n\nIn ''Proprietates Algebraicarum Curvarum'' (1772) Waring reissued in a much revised form the first four chapters of the second part of ''Miscellanea Analytica''. He devoted himself to the classification of higher plane curves, improving results obtained by [[Isaac Newton]], [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]], [[Leonhard Euler]], and [[Gabriel Cramer]]. In 1794 he published a few copies of a philosophical work entitled ''An Essay on the Principles of Human Knowledge'', which were circulated among his friends.\n\nWaring's mathematical style is highly analytical. In fact he criticised those British mathematicians who adhered too strictly to geometry. It is indicative that he was one of the subscribers of [[John Landen]]'s ''Residual Analysis'' (1764), one of the works in which the tradition of the Newtonian fluxional calculus was more severely criticised. In the preface of ''Meditationes Analyticae'' Waring showed a good knowledge of continental mathematicians such as [[Alexis Clairaut]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and Euler. He lamented the fact that in Great Britain mathematics was cultivated with less interest than on the continent, and clearly desired to be considered as highly as the great names in continental mathematics\u2014there is no doubt that he was reading their work at a level never reached by any other eighteenth-century British mathematician. Most notably, at the end of chapter three of ''Meditationes Analyticae'' Waring presents some partial fluxional equations (partial differential equations in Leibnizian terminology); such equations are a mathematical instrument of great importance in the study of continuous bodies which was almost completely neglected in Britain before Waring's researches. One of the most interesting results in ''Meditationes Analyticae'' is a test for the convergence of series generally attributed to d'Alembert (the 'ratio test'). The theory of convergence of series (the object of which is to establish when the summation of an infinite number of terms can be said to have a finite 'sum') was not much advanced in the eighteenth century.\n\nWaring's work was known both in Britain and on the continent, but it is difficult to evaluate his impact on the development of mathematics. His work on algebraic equations contained in ''Miscellanea Analytica'' was translated into Italian by [[Vincenzo Riccati]] in 1770. Waring's style is not systematic and his exposition is often obscure. It seems that he never lectured and did not habitually correspond with other mathematicians. After [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande]] in 1796 observed, in ''Notice sur la vie de Condorcet'', that in 1764 there was not a single first-rate analyst in England, Waring's reply, published after his death as 'Original letter of Dr Waring' in the ''Monthly Magazine'', stated that he had given 'somewhere between three and four hundred new propositions of one kind or another'.\n\n==Death==\nDuring his last years he sank into a deep religious melancholy, and a violent cold caused his death, in [[Plealey]], on 15 August 1798. He was buried in the churchyard at [[Fitz, Shropshire]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lagrange polynomial]]\n*[[Waring's prime number conjecture]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Waring}}\n\n{{Lucasian Professors of Mathematics}}\n{{Copley Medallists 1751\u20131800}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waring, Edward}}\n[[Category:1736 births]]\n[[Category:1798 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century English people]]\n[[Category:18th-century English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Magdalene College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Lucasian Professors of Mathematics]]\n[[Category:Number theorists]]\n[[Category:People from Shrewsbury]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Copley Medal]]\n[[Category:Senior Wranglers]]\n[[Category:Date of birth unknown]]", "sha1": "drzgwpxqetynm1svixhggj680g65uzq"}}, {"title": "Eden Phillpotts", "ns": "0", "id": "9724", "revision": {"id": "864906827", "parentid": "860942724", "timestamp": "2018-10-20T09:29:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Vegan4Life", "id": "2684449"}, "comment": "Retitled \"Personality\" section to \"Personal life.\"", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{infobox person\n| name         = Eden Henry Phillpotts\n| image        = Picture of Eden Phillpotts.jpg\n| birth_date   = 4 November 1862\n| birth_place  = Mount Abu, Rajasthan, India\n| death_date   = 29 December 1960\n| death_place  = Broad Clyst, Devon\n|}}\n\n'''Eden Phillpotts''' (4 November 1862 \u2013 29 December 1960) was an English author, poet and dramatist. He was born in Mount Abu, India, was educated in Plymouth, Devon, and worked as an insurance officer for 10 years before studying for the stage and eventually becoming a writer.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=PHILLPOTTS, Eden|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1396|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1396}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nEden Phillpotts was a great-nephew of [[Henry Phillpotts]], Bishop of Exeter. His father Henry Phillpotts was a son of the bishop\u2019s younger brother Thomas Phillpotts. [[James Surtees Phillpotts]] the reforming headmaster of [[Bedford School]] was his second cousin.<ref>''Phillpotts Genealogy'', Percy Phillpotts, 1910 (manuscript in family possession)</ref>\n\nEden Phillpotts was born on 4 November 1862 at [[Mount Abu]] in [[Rajasthan]]. His father Henry was an officer in the [[Indian Army]], while his mother Adelaide was the daughter of an [[Indian Civil Service]] officer posted in Madras, George Jenkins Waters.<ref name=\"DNB\">''Dictionary of National Biography'', article by Thomas Moult</ref>\n\nHenry Phillpotts died in 1866, leaving Adelaide a widow at the age of 21. With her three small sons, of whom Eden was the eldest, she returned to England and settled in [[Plymouth]].<ref name=\"Angle88\">Eden Phillpotts, ''From the Angle of 88'', 1952</ref>\n\nPhillpotts was educated at Mannamead School in Plymouth. At school he showed no signs of a literary bent. In 1879, aged 17, he left home and went to London to earn his living. He found a job as a clerk with the [[RSA Insurance Group|Sun Fire Office]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"Angle88\"/>\n\nPhillpotts\u2019 ambition was to be an actor and he attended evening classes at a drama school for two years. He came to the conclusion that he would never make a name as an actor but might have success as a writer. In his spare time out of office hours he proceeded to create a stream of small works which he was able to sell. In due course he left the insurance company to concentrate on his writing, while also working part-time as assistant editor for the weekly [[Black and White (magazine)|Black and White Magazine]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"Angle88\"/>\n\nEden Phillpotts maintained a steady output of three or four books a year for the next half century. He produced poetry, short stories, novels, plays and mystery tales. Many of his novels were about rural [[Devon]] life and some of his plays were distinguished by their effective use of regional dialect.\n\nEden Phillpotts died at his home in [[Broadclyst]] near [[Exeter]], Devon, on 29 December 1960.\n\n==Personal life==\nPhillpotts was for many years the President of the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]] and cared passionately about the conservation of Dartmoor.  He was an agnostic and a supporter of the [[Rationalist Press Association]].<ref>''\"...among the honorary associates of the [Rationalist Press] Association, past and present, are distinguished names such as...Eden Phillpotts.\"'' Quoted in [[Harry Snell, 1st Baron Snell|Lord Snell]], ''Men, Movements And Myself'' (p. 156), J.M. Dent and Sons, 1936.</ref>\n\nPhillpotts was a friend of [[Agatha Christie]], who was an admirer of his work and a regular visitor to his home. In her autobiography she expressed gratitude for his early advice on fiction writing and quoted some of it. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was another Phillpotts admirer.<ref>''Jorge Luis Borges: Conversations''. University Press of Mississippi, 1998. Page 218.</ref> Borges mentioned him numerous times, wrote at least two reviews of his novels, and included him in his \"Personal Library\", a collection of works selected to reflect his personal literary preferences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jorge Luis Borges Personal Library Collection|url=http://www.personallibrarieslibrary.com/2010/05/jorge-luis-borges-personal-library.html|website=personallibrarieslibrary.com|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nPhilpotts allegedly had a long incestuous relationship with his daughter Adelaide. In a 1976 interview for a book about her father, Adelaide described an incestuous relationship with him that she says lasted from the age of five or six until her early thirties, when he remarried. When she herself finally married at the age of 55 her father never forgave her, and never communicated with her again.<ref name=ade>James Y.

One of his novels, ''[[Widecombe Fair (novel)|Widecombe Fair]]'', inspired by an annual [[Widecombe Fair|fair]] at the village of [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]], provided the scenario for his comic play ''[[The Farmer's Wife (play)|The Farmer's Wife]]'' (1916). It went on to become a 1928 silent [[The Farmer's Wife|film of the same name]], directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. It was followed by a [[The Farmer's Wife (1941 film)|1941 remake]], directed by [[Norman Lee]] and [[Leslie Arliss]].\n\nHe co-wrote several plays with his daughter [[Adelaide Phillpotts]],<ref name=\"Head2006\">{{cite book|last=Head|first=Dominic (ed.)|title=The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQINrHtwNU0C&pg=PA868|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83179-6|page=868}}</ref> ''The Farmer's Wife'' and ''[[Yellow Sands (play)|Yellow Sands]]'' (1926);<ref>I.

His Dartmoor cycle of 18 novels and two volumes of short stories still has many avid readers despite the fact that many titles are out of print.\n\nPhilpotts also wrote a series of novels, each set against the background of a different trade or industry. Titles include: ''Brunel's Tower'' (a pottery) and ''Storm in a Teacup'' (hand-papermaking). Among his other works is ''The Grey Room'', the plot of which is centered on a haunted room in an English manor house. He also wrote a number of other mystery novels, both under his own name and the pseudonym '''Harrington Hext'''. These include: ''The Thing at Their Heels'', ''[[The Red Redmaynes]]'', ''The Monster'', ''The Clue from the Stars'', and ''The Captain's Curio''. ''The Human Boy''<ref>Philpotts, Eden; The Human Boy; Pub: Harper & Brothers, 1899.</ref> was a collection of schoolboy stories in the same genre as [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Stalky & Co.]], though different in mood and style. Late in his long writing career he wrote a few books of interest to science fiction and [[fantasy]] readers, the most noteworthy being ''Saurus'', which involves an alien reptilian observing human life.\n\n[[Eric Partridge]] praised the immediacy and impact of his dialect writing.<ref>Eric Partridge, ''Usage and Abusage'' (1964) p. 96</ref>\n\n==Photographs==\n<gallery>\nPostbridge Clapper Bridge 2005-07-21.jpg|The [[clapper bridge]] at [[Postbridge]], which is the central location of Phillpotts' novel ''The Thief of Virtue''.\n</gallery>\n\n==Works==\n{{Div col|small=yes|colwidth=22em}}\n\n'''Novels'''\n*''The End of a Life'' (1891)\n*''Folly and Fresh Air'' (1891)\n*''A Tiger's Club'' (1892)\n*[https://archive.org/details/adealwithdevil00philgoog ''A Deal with the Devil''] (1895)\n*[https://archive.org/details/someeverydayfol00philgoog ''Some Every-day Folks''] (1895)\n*[https://archive.org/details/mylaughingphilo00philgoog ''My Laughing Philosopher''] (1896)\n*[https://archive.org/details/downdartmoorway00philgoog ''Down Dartmoor Way''] (1896)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=9tE_AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Lying Prophets: A Novel''] (1897)\n*''Children of the Mist'' (1898)\n*''Sons of the Morning'' (1900)<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Phillpotts\n | first = Eden\n | title = Sons of the Morning\n | accessdate = 2008-06-17\n | year = 1900\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hzb63eYDcyQC\n | publisher = [[G.

Ties are further strengthened by the presence of an estimated 150,000-200,000 Ecuadorians living in the United States and by 24,000 U.S. citizens visiting Ecuador annually, and by approximately 15,000 U.S. citizens residing in Ecuador.  The United States assists Ecuador's economic development directly through the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) program in Ecuador and through multilateral organizations such as the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. In addition, the U.S. [[Peace Corps]] operates a sizable program in Ecuador. More than 100 U.S. companies are doing business in Ecuador.\nRelations between the two nations have been strained following [[Julian Assange|Julian Assange's]] bid to seek political asylum in the [[Ecuadorian embassy in London]] following repeated claims that the US government was pursuing his extradition<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905973.html |title=WikiLeaks founder could be charged under Espionage Act |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2010-11-30|accessdate=2012-08-19 |first1=Ellen |last1=Nakashima |first2=Jerry |last2=Markon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/11/us-opens-wikileaks-grand-jury-hearing |title=WikiLeaks: US opens grand jury hearing &#124; Media |work=The Guardian |date= 2011-05-11|accessdate=2012-08-19 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Feinstein |first=Dianne |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703989004575653280626335258 |title=Dianne Feinstein: Prosecute Assange Under the Espionage Act - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> due to his work with Wikileaks.\n<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Dominiczak |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/wikileaks-julian-assange-wants-to-carry-on-mission-says-ecuador-leader-7872213.html |title=WikiLeaks: Julian Assange wants to carry on \u2018mission\u2019 says Ecuador leader - UK - News - Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> Ecuador offered political asylum to Julian Assange in November 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Uribarri |first=Jaime |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-30/news/27082857_1_ecuador-wikileaks-espionage |title=WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange offered asylum in Ecuador; calls for Hillary Clinton's resignation - New York Daily News |publisher=Articles.nydailynews.com |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBoth nations are signatories of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (the ''Rio Treaty'') of 1947, the Western Hemisphere's regional mutual security treaty. Ecuador shares U.S. concern over increasing narcotrafficking and international terrorism and has energetically condemned terrorist actions, whether directed against government officials or private citizens. The government has maintained Ecuador virtually free of coca production since the mid-1980s and is working to combat [[money laundering]] and the transshipment of drugs and chemicals essential to the processing of [[cocaine]].\n\nEcuador and the U.S. agreed in 1999 to a 10-year arrangement whereby U.S. military surveillance aircraft could use the [[Manta Air Base|airbase at Manta]], [[Ecuador]], as a ''Forward Operating Location'' to detect drug trafficking flights through the region. The arrangement expired in 2009; current president [[Rafael Correa]] vowed not to renew it, and since then the Ecuador has not had any foreign military facilities in the country.\n\nIn fisheries issues, the United States claims jurisdiction for the management of coastal fisheries up to 200 mile (370&nbsp;km) from its coast, but excludes highly migratory species; Ecuador, on the other hand, claims a 200-mile (370-km) territorial sea, and imposes license fees and fines on foreign fishing vessels in the area, making no exceptions for catches of migratory species. In the early 1970s, Ecuador seized about 100 foreign-flag vessels (many of them U.S.) and collected fees and fines of more than $6 million. After a drop-off in such seizures for some years, several U.S. tuna boats were again detained and seized in 1980 and 1981.\n\nThe U.S. [[Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act]] then triggered an automatic prohibition of U.S. imports of tuna products from Ecuador. The prohibition was lifted in 1983, and although fundamental differences between U.S. and Ecuadorian legislation still exist, there is no current conflict. During the period that has elapsed since seizures which triggered the tuna import ban, successive Ecuadorian governments have declared their willingness to explore possible solutions to this problem with mutual respect for longstanding positions and principles of both sides. The election of [[Rafael Correa]] in October 2006, has strained relations between the two countries and relations have since been fraught with tension.

Played on a [[Billiard table|pool table]] with six [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]], the game is so universally known in some countries that beginners are often unaware of other pool games and believe the word \"pool\" itself refers to eight-ball.{{fact|date=December 2017}} The game has numerous variations, mostly regional. Standard eight-ball is the second most competitive professional pool game, after [[nine-ball]], and for the last several decades ahead of [[straight pool]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nEight-ball is played with [[cue stick]]s and 16 [[Billiard balls|balls]]: a {{Cuegloss|cue ball}}, and 15 {{Cuegloss|object ball}}s consisting of seven striped balls, seven solid-colored balls and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a {{Cuegloss|Break|break shot}}, the players are assigned either the group of solid balls or the stripes once a ball from a particular group is legally pocketed. The ultimate object of the game is to legally pocket the eight ball in a called pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table.\n\n==History==\nThe game of eight-ball is derived from an earlier game invented around 1900 (first recorded in 1908) in the United States and initially popularized under the name \"B.B.C. Co. Pool\" (a name that was still in use as late as 1925) by the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company]]. This forerunner game was played with seven {{Cuegloss|Yellow ball|yellow}} and seven {{Cuegloss|red ball}}s, a {{Cuegloss|black ball}}, and the cue ball. Today, numbered {{Cuegloss|stripes}} and {{Cuegloss|solids}} are preferred in most of the world, though the British-style offshoot, [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], uses the traditional colors (as did early televised \"casino\" tournaments in the United States). The game had relatively simple rules compared to today and was not added (under any name) to an official rule book (i.e., one published by a national or international [[sport governing body]]) until 1940.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>{{rp|24, 89\u201390}}<ref name=\"Jewett 2002\">{{cite journal\n| last = Jewett\n| first = Bob\n|date=February 2002\n| title = 8-Ball Rules: The Many Different Versions of One of Today's Most Common Games\n| journal = Billiards Digest Magazine\n| pages = 22\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"Hickock 2001\">{{Cite web|first=Ralph |last=Hickok |year=2001 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/billiard.shtml |title=Sports History: Pocket Billiards |accessdate=2006-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013523/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/billiard.shtml |archivedate=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"BCA 2005\">{{Cite web|publisher=Billiard Congress America |date=1995\u20132005 |url=http://www.bca-pool.com/aboutus/history/start.shtml |title=A Brief History of the Noble Game of Billiards |first=Mike |last=Shamos |accessdate=2006-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127151057/http://www.bca-pool.com/aboutus/history/start.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Standardized rules of play==\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nAmerican-style eight-ball rules are played around the world by professionals, and in many amateur leagues. Nevertheless, the rules for eight-ball may be the most contested of any billiard game. There are several competing sets of \"official\" rules. The non-profit [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA) &ndash; with national affiliates around the world, some of which long pre-date the WPA, such as the [[Billiard Congress of America]] (BCA) &ndash; promulgates standardized rules as ''Pool Billiards &ndash; The Rules of Play''<ref name=\"WPARules\">{{cite book |title=Pool Billiards &ndash; The Rules of Play |url= http://www.wpa-pool.com/pdf/web/WPA_Rules.pdf |format=PDF |date=January 1, 2008 |publisher=[[World Pool-Billiard Association]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref> for amateur and professional play.\n\nMeanwhile, many amateur leagues &ndash; such as the [[American Poolplayers Association]] (APA) / Canadian Poolplayers Association (CPA), the [[Valley National Eight-ball Association]] (VNEA, international in scope despite its historic name) and the [[BCA Pool League]] (BCAPL) &ndash; use their own rulesets; most of these are at least loosely based on the WPA/BCA version. Millions of individuals play informally, using informal house rules which vary not only from area to area but even from venue to venue (\"[[house rule]]s\"). \n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Equipment===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nThe regulation size of the table's playing surface is {{Convert|9|by|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, though exact dimensions may vary slightly by manufacturer. Some leagues and tournaments using the World Standardized Rules may allow smaller sizes, down to {{Convert|7|by|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Early 20th-century {{Convert|10|by|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} models are occasionally also still used. WPA professional competition generally employs regulation tables, while the amateur league championships of various leagues, including ACS, BCAPL, VNEA, and APA, use the 7 foot tables in order to fit more of them into the hosting venue.\n\nThere are seven {{cuegloss|solids|solid-colored balls}} numbered 1 through 7, seven {{cuegloss|stripes|striped balls}} numbered 9 through 15, an {{cuegloss|8 ball}}, and a {{cuegloss|cue ball}}. The balls are usually colored as follows:\n*1 and 9: yellow\n*2 and 10: blue\n*3 and 11: red\n*4 and 12: purple (TV: pink)<sup>1</sup>\n*5 and 13: orange\n*6 and 14: green\n*7 and 15: maroon (TV: tan)<sup>1</sup>\n*8: black\n*Cue: white\n:<sup>1</sup>Special sets designed to be more easily discernible on television substitute a rather light tan shade for the normally darker brown of the 7 and 15 balls, and pink for the dark purple of the 4 and 12; these alternative-color sets are now also available to consumers.\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Setup===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nTo start the game, the {{Cuegloss|object ball}}s are placed in a triangular [[Rack (billiards)|rack]].  The base of the rack is parallel to the {{Cuegloss|end rail}} (the short end of the pool table) and positioned so the apex ball of the rack is located on the {{Cuegloss|foot spot}}.  The balls in the rack are ideally placed so that they are all in contact with one another; this is accomplished by pressing the balls together toward the apex ball. The order of the balls should be random, with the exceptions of the 8 ball, which must be placed in the center of the rack (i.e., the middle of the third row), and the two back corner balls, one of which must be a stripe and the other a solid.<!--Do NOT change that. This is a standardized rule in all major leagues. No one cares whether your bar-pool rules want the 1-ball in the front and solids on the corners.--> The cue ball is placed anywhere the breaker desires behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}}. \n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Break===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nOne person is chosen by some predetermined method (e.g., [[coin toss]], {{Cuegloss|lag}}, or win or loss of previous game or match) to shoot first, using the cue ball to {{Cuegloss|break}} the object-ball rack apart. In most leagues it is the breaker's opponent who racks the balls, but in some, players break their own racks. If the breaker fails to make a successful break\u2014usually defined as at least four balls hitting cushions or an object ball being pocketed\u2014then the opponent can opt either to play from the current position or to call for a {{Cuegloss|re-rack}} and either re-break or have the original breaker repeat the break.\n[[File:8 ball break time lapse.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Long-exposure photography|Long-exposure photograph]] of a break in eight-ball]]\n\nIf the 8 ball is pocketed on the break then the breaker can choose either to {{cuegloss|re-spot}} the 8 ball and play from the current position or to re-rack and re-break; but if the cue ball is also pocketed on the break then the opponent is the one who has the choice: either to re-spot the 8 ball and shoot with {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}}, accepting the current position, or to re-break or have the breaker re-break. {{crossref|printworthy=y|(For regional amateur variations, such as pocketing the 8 ball on the break resulting in instant win or loss, see [[#Informal rule variations|\"Informal rule variations\", below]].)}}\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Turn-taking===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nA player (or team) continues to shoot until committing a {{Cuegloss|foul}} or failing to legally pocket an object ball (whether {{Cuegloss|Safety|intentionally}} or not); thereupon it is the turn of the opposing player(s). Play alternates in this manner for the remainder of the game. Following a foul, the incoming player has {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} anywhere on the table, unless the foul occurred on the break shot, as noted previously.<ref name=\"WPARules\" />\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Selection of the target group===\nAt some point in the game, one of the players can select balls 1\u20137 (the \"solids\") or balls 9\u201315 (the \"stripes\") as their group (or ''suit'') of object balls by legally pocketing a ball from one group. The other player is assigned the other suit. Balls pocketed on the break shot are not used to assign the suits. Once the suits have been assigned, they remain fixed throughout the remainder of the game.\n\n===Pocketing the 8 ball===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nOnce all of a player's (or team's) group of object balls are pocketed, the player attempts to sink the 8 ball. In order to win the game the player first designates which pocket the 8 ball will be pocketed into and then successfully pockets the 8 ball into that pocket. If the player knocks the 8 ball off the table then the player loses the game. If the player pockets the 8 ball and commits a foul or pockets it into another pocket than the one designated then the player loses the game. ''(For regional amateur variations, such as fouling while trying to pocket the 8 ball resulting in instant loss despite not pocketing the 8, see [[#Informal rule variations|\"Informal rule variations\"]], below.)'' Otherwise (i.e., if the 8 ball is neither pocketed nor knocked off the table) the shooter's turn is simply over, even if a foul occurs. In short, a World Standardized Rules game of eight-ball, like a game of nine-ball, is not over until the \"{{Cuegloss|money ball}}\" is no longer on the table. This rule may be unfamiliar to some bar and league (e.g. [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]]) players, for whom such a foul normally means losing the game. The rule has been increasingly adopted by amateur leagues, including [[Valley National 8-Ball League Association|VNEA]] beginning with the {{sic|hide=y|2008/2009}} season, [[BCA Pool League|BCAPL]], and [[USA Pool League|USAPL]].\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Winning===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nAny of the following results in a player winning the game:\n*The player legally pockets the 8 ball into a designated pocket, after all of that player's object balls have been pocketed\n*The opposing player illegally pockets the 8 ball (e.g., before clearing all of that player's object balls, does so on the same shot as the last such object ball, or sinks the 8 ball into a pocket other than the one that was designated, or commits any foul, including scratching the cue ball into a pocket or knocking it off the table, while pocketing the 8 ball)\n*The opposing player knocks the 8 ball off the table\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Fouls===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n*The shooter fails to strike one of their own object balls (or the 8 ball, if all of said object balls are already pocketed) with the cue ball, before other balls (if any) are contacted by the cue ball.

One particularly common feature of Canadian bar pool is the \"hooked yourself on the 8\" rule \u2013 failure to hit the 8 ball when one is shooting for the 8 is a loss of game, {{em|unless}} one was hooked ({{Cuegloss|snooker}}ed) by one's opponent (even then, if {{Cuegloss|Called pocket|a pocket is called}} for the 8, as opposed to \"just a shot\", i.e. a {{Cuegloss|safety}}, failure to hit the 8 is an instant loss).  Pocketing an opponent's {{Cuegloss|object ball}} while shooting for the 8, even if the shot was otherwise legal, is also a game-loser, often even in local league play. It is also an automatic loss if a player {{cuegloss|scratch}}es while shooting for the 8, regardless of whether the eight ball is pocketed or not. \"{{Cuegloss|Split}}\" shots, where the {{Cuegloss|cue ball}} appears to simultaneously strike a legal and an opponent's object balls, are generally considered legal shots in informal games, as long as they are called as split shots, and the hit is in fact simultaneous to the human eye.  A further Canadian bar-pool rule is that a shot is a {{Cuegloss|visit}}-ending (but not {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}}) foul if one pockets one's called shot but also pockets another ball incidentally, even if it is one's own (however, if that secondary pocketing was also called, the shot is legal, regardless of the order in which the balls were dropped). Finally, it is also a visit-ending foul if the cue ball touches any ball that is ultimately pocketed more than once on the same shot (this is colloquially known as a \"double kiss\"), even if the player called for the ball to enter that particular pocket on the shot.\nThe last black ball has just three chances to select pocket position.\n\n===Latin America===\n\nThe {{Cuegloss|rack}}ed balls are often loose, crooked and/or not exactly on the {{Cuegloss|foot spot}} (it is not considered to matter), and the [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] itself may be made of rubber, and flexible, making a tight rack physically impossible to achieve. Other than the 8 ball, other balls may be placed far more randomly than players in other areas would tolerate, with large clusters of solids together, and stripes with each other.\n\nIn most of [[Latin America]], including Mexico, shots are un-{{Cuegloss|call}}ed, as in British pool (i.e. {{Cuegloss|slop}} shots count, a concept foreign to most American players other than [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]] league members). In many if not most areas (Brazil being an exception), fouls result in {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}} only, as in American bar pool (allowing for intentional scratches that leave the opponent a very difficult shot if all opponent balls are \"in the {{Cuegloss|kitchen}}\", behind the headstring).\n\nA common Latin American variant of \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\" is that each player is allowed either one (or even two) cue-ball scratches when shooting for the 8, which {{em|must}} be pocketed in the same pocket as the shooter's final object ball. Such fouls simply end the shooter's turn at the table and give the opponent ball-in-hand behind the head string; only the second (or third, respectively) such scratch is a loss of game (though scratching the 8 ball itself off the table or into the wrong pocket is an instant loss). This version is common even in US pool bars that are frequented by recent [[Latino]] immigrants. This requirement has a profound effect upon game strategy \u2013 it is effectively 5 times harder to {{Cuegloss|run out}} \u2013 and most North American (and British, etc.) players are completely unprepared for it, unless they are last-pocket players. Players must be very mindful what they do with their last few balls, and common failure to get {{Cuegloss|shape}} that allows for the last object-ball shot to set the player up for an easy 8 ball shot into the same pocket leads to long games with many {{Cuegloss|bank}}, {{Cuegloss|kick}} and {{Cuegloss|kiss}} shots on the 8.\n\nIn some parts of Latin America, especially South America, the 1 ball often must be pocketed in the side pocket on the right-hand side of the table (relative to the end of the table one breaks from), and the 15 ball must be pocketed in the left side pocket.  This rule probably developed to make it harder to run out after the first shot. Position play takes a larger role in this variation, and a player's strategy must necessarily initially revolve around getting the 1 or 15 in while preventing this opponent from doing likewise. When racking the balls for this variation, the 1 and 15 balls are placed behind the 8 ball at the center of the rack, the 1 ball on the left and the 15 ball on the right (from the {{em|racker's}} perspective). Latino last-pocket is virtually the only version of eight-ball played in Mexico, other than in the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] area.<!-- Is there a name for this variation? --> Another variant in Latin America is that the only ball-in-hand (behind the head string) foul is {{Cuegloss|scratch}}ing the cue ball into a pocket; other fouls are simply loss-of-turn.\n\nIn Mexico, a minority of players rack with the 8 ball rather than the apex ball on the foot spot, a trait in common with British-style [[Blackball (pool)|blackball/8-ball pool]].  Pocketing the 8 ball on the {{Cuegloss|break}} shot is an instant win, as it usually is in American bar pool, but is not in the international rules.  Because Mexican pool, except near the US border, is almost always played on open-pocket [[Billiard hall|pool-hall]]-style tables, rather than coin-operated tables that trap object balls, any of one's own balls pocketed on a foul are {{Cuegloss|spot}}ted (but how they are spotted varies widely, with the balls often placed against the {{Cuegloss|foot cushion}} on the {{Cuegloss|center string}}, and adjacent to nearby {{Cuegloss|diamonds}} if more than one must be spotted, instead of on the foot spot, but sometimes even to the {{em|side}} at {{Cuegloss|long rail}} diamonds, due to the influence of [[Coyote (pool)|coyote]], a Mexican variant of [[Chicago (pool)|Chicago]]; foot-spot spotting is neither common nor uncommon.)  Pool itself is not considered a very serious game in the country other than in the northern [[States of Mexico|states]]; in most of Mexico, [[three-cushion billiards]] is the serious game, while pool is mostly played by youths, by groups of friends (including many young women) as a bar game to pass the time, and by older working-class men as an after-work activity. In many recreation halls, [[dominoes]] is more popular than pool.\n\nIn many bars in Brazil (and not an official rule), a foul is generally punished by pocketing the lowest-numbered ball of the opponent. In that case, the cue ball remains where it stopped, as ball-in-hand is not commonly used. Additionally, in the case of scratching the cue ball, the opponent places the cue ball in the {{Cuegloss|kitchen}}, on the {{Cuegloss|head spot}}, or most commonly anywhere inside {{Cuegloss|\"D\", the|the \"D\"}}, indicating some British [[snooker]] and/or [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] influence.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011|reason=This section may be original research and/or local stuff; the NZ pool film \"Stickmen\" seems to contradict most or all of this.}}\nNew Zealand eight-ball in many respects is closer to British [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], but with numbered balls being used. {{Cuegloss|\"D\", the|A \"D\"}} is typically drawn on the table above the {{cuegloss|baulk line}}<!--Does it coincide with the headstring, by running from diamond to diamond, or it is a bit closer to the bottom [head] rail, proportionally, like in snooker?--> (as on a snooker table) and the shooting player is required to place the cue ball within it on the {{cuegloss|break-off}} and after an opponent {{cuegloss|Scratch|scratches}}. The shooting player can shoot the ball in any direction from within the \"D\". If no \"D\" is drawn on the table then the \"forward play\" rule is followed: After a scratch, the player with ball-in-hand must shoot forward of the baulk line, i.e. towards the rack area, even if all legal balls are behind the baulk line. The \"{{Cuegloss|Two shots|two-shot rule}}\" of blackball may or may not be followed; this depends on individual players and/or pubs.\n\nThe \"nomination\" rule is unique to New Zealand: A player {{Cuegloss|snooker}}ed on the 8 ball may nominate one of the opponent's balls (if any remain) to hit as an alternative, legal \"{{cuegloss|ball on}}\". However, the shooter is not permitted to pot (pocket) such a nominated ball &ndash; doing so results in a loss of game.\n\n===North Africa===\nIn North African countries (as in Latin America, but reversed), both the 1 and 15 balls must be pocketed in the sides, the 15 on the right and 1 on the left (relative to the end of the table one breaks from). The North African version of the informal game is always played \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\". {{Cuegloss|Ball-in-hand}} is not taken on fouls, and \"{{Cuegloss|bank-the-8}}\" is a very common rule in addition to last-pocket.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}<!--There are almost certainly actual eight-ball as opposed to 8-ball pool/blackball rules in the UK and Ireland that need to be documented here.-->\n{{further|Blackball (pool)}}\nPool is popularly played in two forms. Traditionally it is played with smaller balls than the internationally standardized version, on a 4.5 by 7 foot [[Public house|pub]]-sized table, with differently shaped, smaller pockets. The {{cuegloss|cue ball}} is also slightly smaller than the {{cuegloss|object balls}}.  \"American-style\" pool tables are also common in the UK, especially for [[nine-ball]] competition; the tables themselves are often referred to as \"nine-ball tables\", with that game being played only rarely on the more common, smaller traditional British-style tables.  The two most common competitive rule sets used on the traditional tables are WEPF world {{sic|hide=y|eightball pool}} rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/wrules.php|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> (replacing old EPA rules),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/rules.php|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> and WPA world-standardized blackball rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&pagetype=rules|title=World Pool-Billiard Association - 9 Ball Rules|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> Most amateurs play \"pub rules\", meaning the local rule variation established at that venue.\n\nThe two standardized competitive rule sets have features to which some amateur pub players object. As one example, WEPF rules permit intentional fouls. Despite opponents being awarded two visits for a standard foul in pub pool, for one to cause an intentional foul or to not try to play a legal shot is seen as unsportsmanlike (as it is in pub/bar pool in the US and many other places). As another example, in WPA rules, rather than {{cuegloss|two-shot carry|getting two independent visits}} after a foul, the incoming player gets one {{cuegloss|Free ball|free shot}} and then play returns to normal. As most pub rules are based around old EPA rules, in which two visits are awarded (rather than a free shot) amateurs are often unhappy with this difference in blackball, although it is in no way as offensive as intentional fouls which are illegal in blackball and result in {{em|loss of frame}}.\n\nNot all differences are controversial. Both WEPF and WPA require a player to either pot on their visit, or drive any ball, including the white, into a cushion after hitting a legal object ball, or else they give a foul. Although the precise specifics of the rule are a mouthful, many amateur players find the it acceptable. It is primarily as a way to prevent \"tucking up\", whereby a player does not attempt to pot and instead just rolls up to their object ball to use it to snooker their opponent; tucking up is seen as unsporting, so being forced to play harder shots is quite welcomed.\n\nThere are several sets of rules which use a combination of many others in an attempt to find a balance between WPA rules, which are seen as more aggressive, and WEPF rules which are often referred to, pejoratively, as \"chess\" because of the amount of {{cuegloss|safety}} play they encourage, which can drag a game out.\n\n===Pakistan===\nDuring game play, if the player fails to hit a ball of the designated group, or hits the opponent's ball with the cue ball, then the opponent receives 2 shots unless the opponent has pocketed all his or her balls and only the 8 ball remains, in which case the opponent will only get one shot. In case of such a foul, the game continues with the player playing the cue ball at the place where it stopped. If a scratch occurs, then the opponent plays ball-in-hand, but is only allowed to place it anywhere in the D.  However, that player may shoot the cue ball in any direction. Knocking a ball (apart from the cue ball) off the table carries no penalty. Instead, the misplaced ball is returned to its original place and the game continues.\n\n===India===\nIf a scratch or other foul occurs while playing the 8 ball, as long as the opponent has at least one ball of his or her group present on the table and the 8 ball is not pocketed, the game continues. In both cases of this foul-on-the-8 situation, the opponent gets two chances (regardless of whether any balls are potted on the first chance) before the fouling player may shoot again. In these circumstances, treatment of the cue ball depends on the type of foul. If the cue ball had been scratched, the cue ball must be placed behind the break line.{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=On both tries, or just the first one?}} If it was some other foul which had occurred while playing the 8 ball, the cue ball is not moved. If the incoming opponent scratches,{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Does a scratch by the incoming opponent on EITHER turn give two turns to original shooter, or only if the scratch was on the 2nd one? What about non-scratch fouls? Does a foul on the first attempt just lead to the second attempt, or does the original player now get two chances? Does a foul on the 2nd attempt lead to two changes for the original shooter, or just end the incoming opponent's turn?}} the player who originally fouled now receives two chances. When the 8 ball is the only ball on the table, any kind of foul ends the game, and the opponent of the fouling player wins.\n\n===United States===\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:PoolPlayers.jpg|thumb|300px|American bar players]]\nMost commonly of all in American {{Cuegloss|bar pool}} \u2013 sometimes called '''straight eight''' by its aficionados, and usually played on coin-operated, smaller tables \u2013 a requirement may be that all shots be {{cuegloss|Call-shot|called}} {{em|in detail}}. This typically includes what balls and bank/kick cushions will be involved in the shot, and in what order. The shot considered a turn-ending (but not ball-in-hand) foul if not executed precisely as planned, but a loss of game if the \"foul\" shot pocketed the 8 ball.<ref>See for example: {{Cite web\n|url=http://www.pool-billiards-game.com/billiard-rules.html\n|title=Billiard Rules? Bar Rules, League Rules, Which Rules Are Straight Eight?\n|first=Ted\n|last=Mauro\n|work=Pool-Billiards-Game.com\n|location=[[Pueblo, Colorado]]\n|publisher=self-published\n|year=2007\n|accessdate=2009-06-13\n}} Many other blogs and offline personal writings can confirm this author's take on the matter, but little authoritative has been written on the subject, as \"bar pool\" is of little consequence in the world of organized pool.</ref> Contrariwise, some Americans hold that nothing other than the 8 ball has to be called in any way \u2013 i.e., that \"{{cuegloss|slop}}\" counts.\n\nIn informal amateur play in most areas, the table will only be considered open if no balls were pocketed, or an equal number of stripes and solids were pocketed, or the cue ball was {{cuegloss|scratch}}ed (into a pocket or off the table), on the {{cuegloss|break}}; if an odd number of balls were legally pocketed, such as one solid and two stripes, or no solids and one stripe, the breaker must shoot the balls that were pocketed in the greatest quantity (stripes in these examples). The table is almost never considered so {{cuegloss|open}} as for it to be legal to use a ball of the opposite {{cuegloss|suit}}, much less the 8 ball, as the first ball in a combination shot while the table is open (despite this being perfectly legal in WPA World Standardized and many US league rules). In non-{{cuegloss|money games}} it is fairly common for a foul break in which the rack was not struck at all (e.g., due to a {{cuegloss|miscue}}) to be re-shot by the original breaker.\n\nFouls, in common bar pool, that are not cue-ball scratches generally only cause loss of turn, with cue ball left in place (even if it is {{cuegloss|hook}}ed).  Even in the case of a scratch, this only results in {{cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} {{em|behind the {{cuegloss|head string}}}}.  Regionally, there is a great deal of bar pool variation in the handling of fouls while shooting at and/or pocketing the 8 ball. In some cases any foul while shooting at but not pocketing the 8 is a loss of game, in others only a foul while otherwise successfully pocketing the 8, and in yet others only certain fouls, such as also sinking an opponent's ball and the 8 on the same shot, or hitting the 8 then cue-ball scratching, are game-losing.\n\nWhat is considered a foul further diverges from established, published rulesets. Scoop-under {{cuegloss|jump shot}}s are usually considered valid (these are fouls in WPA and most league rules, as they are {{cuegloss|double-hit}}s, though few players realize it).  When a cue ball is frozen or near-frozen to an object ball, shooting it dead-on, in line with both balls, is a foul in most formal rulesets (as another kind of double-hit), but is generally tolerated in bar pool.\n\nOther US bar pool oddities varying from area to area include:  Knocking the cue ball off the table on the break may be an instant loss; scratching on the break may be an instant loss; pocketing the 8 ball on the break (without scratching) may be either an instant win or instant loss (the latter being a rare variant); no safeties may be allowed at all \u2013 all shots may be required to be at least vaguely plausible attempts to pocket a legal ball; all jump shots may be banned; {{cuegloss|mass\u00e9}} shots may be banned; it may be illegal to use the 8 ball in any way in combinations, caroms, or kisses; the 8 ball may be required to be pocketed \"cleanly\" in the sense of no contact with other object balls (even if the {{cuegloss|kiss}} shot can be accurately called); failure to hit one of one's own object balls (or the 8 if shooting for the 8) may be considered a \"table scratch\" that gives the opponent a shot in-hand from behind the head string; failure to hit the 8 if shooting for the 8 may be a loss of game; and a \"split\" shot, where the cue ball appears to simultaneously strike a legal ball and an opponent's object ball, may be considered a legal shot, as long as it is called as a split shot, and the hit is simultaneous to the naked eye.\n\n\"{{Cuegloss|Bank-the-8}}\" is a common American amateur variation, especially on coin-operated {{Cuegloss|bar tables}} (because it usually makes the game last longer), in which the 8 ball must be {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|banked}} off one or more {{Cuegloss|cushions}} ({{Cuegloss|kick shot}}s may also qualify in some versions), into the {{Cuegloss|Call-pocket|called pocket}}; either player may suggest bank-the-eight at any time before or during the game, and the other may accept or refuse; all other rules apply as usual. Playing bank-the-eight may be considered rude if other players are waiting for a turn at the table.\n\nA similarly motivated variant is \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\", in which the 8 ball must be pocketed in the same pocket as the shooting player's last object ball (i.e., each player may be said to eventually \"own\" a pocket in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their {{Cuegloss|suit}}); all other rules apply as usual.  This variant is also popular in Mexico.\n\nDue probably to the influence of [[nine-ball]], in which the 1 ball ''must'' be the apex ball of the rack, most American bar players traditionally rack a game of eight-ball with the 1 ball in this position. Racking is also typically done solid-stripe-solid-stripe-solid along the two sides of the rack, resulting in solids being on all three corners. This is not a legal rack in World Standardized Rules, nor any other notable league ruleset other than [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]].\n\n<!-- *******************************************************************************************\n        Please do NOT add your school, local club, league, neighborhood\n        or even city variants.

As with American-style eight-ball, there are multiple competing standards bodies that have issued international rules. Aside from using unnumbered object balls (except for the 8), UK-style tables have pockets just larger than the balls. More than one type of {{Cuegloss|rest}} is typically used. Most tables do not have {{cuegloss|diamond}}s on the rails, and consequently the racking spot is on the {{cuegloss|baulk line}} not at the second-diamond {{cuegloss|headstring}}. The rules significantly differ in numerous ways, including the handling of fouls, which may give the opponent two shots, racking (the 8 ball, not the apex ball, goes on the spot), selection of which group of balls will be shot by which player, handling of {{Cuegloss|frozen}} balls and {{Cuegloss|snooker}}s, and many other details.\n\nThe English Pool Association<ref>[http://www.epa.org.uk/index.php English Pool Association]</ref> is recognized by the [[UK Sport|Sports Council]] as the governing body for pool including blackball in England.\n<!--DO NOT ADD PUB-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Eight-ball rotation===\n{{Details|Rotation (pool)}}\nThe hybrid game '''eight-ball rotation''' is a combination of eight-ball and [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], in which the players must pocket their balls (other than the 8, which remains last) in numerical order.

It has the ability to combine measurements of the [[project management triangle]]: scope, time, and costs.\n\nIn a single integrated system, earned value management is able to provide accurate forecasts of project performance problems, which is an important contribution for project management.\n\nEarly EVM research showed that the areas of planning and control are significantly impacted by its use; and similarly, using the methodology improves both scope definition as well as the analysis of overall project performance. More recent research studies have shown that the principles of EVM are positive  predictors of project success.<ref>Marshall, Robert.

However, the most basic requirement of an EVM system is that it quantifies progress using PV and EV.\n\n===Application example===\nProject A has been approved for a duration of one year and with the budget of X. It was also planned that the project spends 50% of the approved budget in the first six months. If now, six months after the start of the project, a project manager would report that he has spent 50% of the budget, one can initially think, that the project is perfectly on plan. However, in reality the provided information is not sufficient to come to such a conclusion. The project can spend 50% of the budget, whilst finishing only 25% of the work, which would mean the project is not doing well; or the project can spend 50% of the budget, whilst completing 75% of the work, which would mean that project is doing better than planned. EVM is meant to address such and similar issues.\n\n==History==\nEVM emerged as a [[financial analysis]] specialty in [[United States Government]] programs in the 1960s, but it has since become a significant branch of [[project management]] and [[cost engineering]].  Project management [[research]] investigating the contribution of EVM to project success suggests a moderately strong positive relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Robert A. |title=The contribution of earned value management to project success on contracted efforts: A quantitative statistics approach within the population of experienced practitioners |publisher=PMI (www.pmi.org) |date=2006-11-09 |url=http://www.ncmahq.org/files/articles/jcm07_pp21-33.pdf |accessdate=2006-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722223448/http://www.ncmahq.org/files/articles/jcm07_pp21-33.pdf |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref>\nImplementations of EVM can be scaled to fit projects of all sizes and complexities.\n\nThe genesis of EVM occurred in industrial manufacturing at the turn of the 20th century, based largely on the principle of \"earned time\" popularized by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank and Lillian Gilbreth]], but the concept took root in the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the 1960s.  The original concept was called [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|PERT/COST]], but it was considered overly burdensome (not very adaptable) by contractors whom were mandated to use it, and many variations of it began to proliferate among various procurement programs.  In 1967, the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] established a criterion-based approach, using a set of 35 criteria, called the Cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria (C/SCSC).  In the 1970s and early 1980s, a [[subculture]] of C/SCSC analysis grew, but the technique was often ignored or even actively resisted by [[project manager]]s in both government and industry.  C/SCSC was often considered a financial control tool that could be delegated to analytical specialists.\n\nIn 1979, EVM was introduced to the architecture and engineering industry in a \"Public Works Magazine\" article by David Burstein, a project manager with a national engineering firm.  This technique has been taught ever since as part of the project management training program presented by PSMJ Resources, an international training and consulting firm that specializes in the engineering and architecture industry.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, EVM emerged as a project management methodology to be understood and used by managers and executives, not just EVM specialists.  In 1989, EVM leadership was elevated  to the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, thus making EVM an element of program management and procurement.  In 1991, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] canceled the Navy [[A-12 Avenger II]] Program because of performance problems detected by EVM.  This demonstrated conclusively that EVM mattered to secretary-level leadership.  In the 1990s, many [[Federal Acquisition Regulations|U.S. Government regulations]] were eliminated or streamlined. However, EVM not only survived the acquisition reform movement, but became strongly associated with the acquisition reform movement itself.  Most notably, from 1995 to 1998, ownership of EVM criteria (reduced to 32) was transferred to industry by adoption of ANSI EIA 748-A standard.<ref>{{cite web\n | year = 1998\n | title = ANSI EIA-748 Standard - Earned Value Management Systems\n | edition = June1998\n | publisher = Electronic Industries Alliance\n | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:KBVRrCRuFvAJ:www.srs.gov/general/EFCOG/02GovtReferences/03NDIAANSI/ANSIEIA748.pdf+%22Earned+Value+Management+Systems%22+eia+748+1998&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi2T9LwmXNQkXKLmBWoTmcVB0UypvcMKZQFmW4FvZ2BO3weJ0T1RkClzfptwc3CkVSn52aBNDWYMmUq9nOvPuNyvCbyLL41oLDWjFu9sf0eVS2x_SJgOtIMAxId5Fik67rH_SK1&sig=AHIEtbQyDmwj4n-qQMgamroJOtn3rnJyHQ}}</ref>\n\nThe use of EVM expanded beyond the U.S. Department of Defense.  It was adopted by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], [[United States Department of Energy]] and other technology-related agencies.  Many industrialized nations also began to utilize EVM in their own procurement programs.\n\nAn overview of EVM was included in the [[Project Management Institute]]'s first [[Project Management Body of Knowledge|PMBOK]] Guide in 1987 and was expanded in subsequent editions. In the most recent edition of the PMBOK guide, EVM is listed among the general tools and techniques for processes to control project costs.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge|date=2013|publisher=Project Management Institute|location=Newtown Square, PA|pages=217\u2013219}}</ref>\n\nThe construction industry was an early commercial adopter of EVM. Closer integration of EVM with the practice of project management accelerated in the 1990s.  In 1999, the Performance Management Association merged with the [[Project Management Institute]] ('''PMI''') to become PMI\u2019s first college, the College of Performance Management. The [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] began to mandate the use of EVM across all government agencies, and, for the first time, for certain internally managed projects (not just for contractors).  EVM also received greater attention by publicly traded companies in response to the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]].\n\nIn Australia EVM has been codified as standards AS 4817-2003 and AS 4817-2006.\n\n== Project tracking ==\n[[File:EVM Fig1.png|right|Figure 1: Tracking AC against a \"spend plan\" is inconclusive (without EV).]]\n[[File:EVM Fig2.png|right|Figure 2: Measuring schedule performance without knowledge of actual cost]]\n[[File:EVM Fig3.png|right|Figure 3: Measuring cost performance without a PV baseline]]\n[[File:EVM Fig4.png|right|Figure 4: The most common form of EVM graphic]]\n\nIt is helpful to see an example of project tracking that does not include earned value performance management.  Consider a project that has been planned in detail, including a time-phased spend plan for all elements of work.  '''Figure 1''' shows the cumulative budget (cost) for this project as a function of time (the blue line, labeled PV).  It also shows the cumulative actual cost of the project (red line, labeled AC) through week 8.  To those unfamiliar with EVM, it might appear that this project was over budget through week 4 and then under budget from week 6 through week 8.  However, what is missing from this chart is any understanding of how much work has been accomplished during the project.  If the project was actually completed at week 8, then the project would actually be well under budget and well ahead of schedule.  If, on the other hand, the project is only 10% complete at week 8, the project is significantly over budget and behind schedule.  A method is needed to measure technical performance objectively and quantitatively, and that is what EVM accomplishes.\n\n=== With EVM ===\nConsider the same project, except this time the project plan includes pre-defined methods of quantifying the accomplishment of work. At the end of each week, the [[project manager]] identifies every detailed element of work that has been completed, and sums the EV for each of these completed elements.  Earned value may be accumulated monthly, weekly, or as progress is made.\n\n== Earned value (EV) ==\n\n<math display=\"inline\">\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{EV} & = \\sum_\\mathrm{Start}^\\mathrm{Current} \\mathrm{PV(Completed)} \\quad \\mathrm{or} \\quad \\mathrm{EV} = \\mathrm{budget\\, at\\, Completion\\,(BAC)} \\times \\mathrm{Actual\\%\\, Complete}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n'''Figure 2''' shows the EV curve (in green) along with the PV curve from Figure 1.  The chart indicates that technical performance (i.e. progress) started more rapidly than planned, but slowed significantly and fell behind schedule at week 7 and 8.  This chart illustrates the schedule performance aspect of EVM.  It is complementary to [[critical path method|critical path]] or [[critical chain]] schedule management.\n\n'''Figure 3''' shows the same EV curve (green) with the actual cost data from Figure 1 (in red).  It can be seen that the project was actually under budget, relative to the amount of work accomplished, since the start of the project.  This is a much better conclusion than might be derived from Figure 1.\n\n'''Figure 4''' shows all three curves together \u2013 which is a typical EVM line chart.  The best way to read these three-line charts is to identify the EV curve first, then compare it to PV (for schedule performance) and AC (for cost performance).  It can be seen from this illustration that a true understanding of cost performance and schedule performance ''relies first on measuring technical performance objectively.''  This is the ''foundational principle'' of EVM.\n\n== Scaling EVM from simple to advanced implementations ==\n'''The ''foundational principle''''' of EVM, mentioned above, does not depend on the size or complexity of the project.  However, the ''implementations'' of EVM can vary significantly depending on the circumstances. In many cases, organizations establish an all-or-nothing threshold; projects above the threshold require a full-featured (complex) EVM system and projects below the threshold are exempted.  Another approach that is gaining favor is to scale EVM implementation according to the project at hand and skill level of the project team.<ref>{{cite web\n  | first1 = Jim | last1 = Sumara\n  | first2 = John | last2 = Goodpasture\n  | title = Earned Value \u2013 The Next Generation \u2013 A Practical Application for Commercial Projects\n  | date = 1997-09-29\n  | url = http://www.sqpegconsulting.com/EV_Chi_97NP03.PDF\n  | accessdate = 2006-10-26 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Goodpasture\n  | first = John C.\n  | title = Quantitative Methods in Project Management\n  | publisher = J.

Still, lightweight implementations of EVM are achievable by any person who has basic spreadsheet skills.  In fact, [[spreadsheet]] implementations are an excellent way to learn basic EVM skills.\n\nThe ''first step'' is to define the work. This is typically done in a hierarchical arrangement called a [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) although the simplest projects may use a simple list of tasks.  In either case, it is important that the WBS or list be comprehensive. It is also important that the elements be [[mutually exclusive]], so that work is easily categorized in one and only one element of work.  The most detailed elements of a WBS hierarchy (or the items in a list) are called activities (or tasks).\n\nThe ''second step'' is to assign a value, called planned value (PV), to each activity.  For large projects, PV is almost always an allocation of the total project budget, and may be in units of currency (e.g. dollar, euro or naira) or in labor hours, or both.  However, in very simple projects, each activity may be assigned a weighted \u201cpoint value\" which might not be a budget number.  Assigning weighted values and achieving consensus on all PV quantities yields an important benefit of EVM, because it exposes misunderstandings and miscommunications about the scope of the project, and resolving these differences should always occur as early as possible.  Some terminal elements can not be known (planned) in great detail in advance, and that is expected, because they can be further refined at a later time.\n\nThe ''third step'' is to define \"earning rules\" for each activity.  The simplest method is to apply just one earning rule, such as the 0/100 rule, to all activities.  Using the 0/100 rule, no credit is earned for an element of work until it is finished.  A related rule is called the 50/50 rule, which means 50% credit is earned when an element of work is started, and the remaining 50% is earned upon completion.  Other fixed earning rules such as a 25/75 rule or 20/80 rule are gaining favor, because they assign more weight to finishing work than for starting it, but they also motivate the project team to identify when an element of work is started, which can improve awareness of work-in-progress.  These simple earning rules work well for small or simple projects because generally each activity tends to be fairly short in duration.\n\nThese initial three steps define the minimal amount of planning for simplified EVM.  The ''final step'' is to execute the project according to the plan and measure progress.  When activities are started or finished, EV is accumulated according to the earning rule.  This is typically done at regular intervals (e.g. weekly or monthly), but there is no reason why EV cannot be accumulated in near real-time, when work elements are started/completed.  In fact, waiting to update EV only once per month (simply because that is when cost data are available) only detracts from a primary benefit of using EVM, which is to create a technical performance [[scoreboard]] for the project team.\n\n[[File:EVM Fig5.png|right|Figure 5: A comparison of three EV curves without PV and AC]]\n\nIn a lightweight implementation such as described here, the project manager has not accumulated cost nor defined a detailed project schedule network (i.e. using a critical path or critical chain methodology).  While such omissions are inappropriate for managing large projects, they are a common and reasonable occurrence in many very small or simple projects.  Any project can benefit from using EV alone as a real-time score of progress.  One useful result of this very simple approach (without schedule models and actual cost accumulation) is to compare EV curves of similar projects, as illustrated in '''Figure 5'''.  In this example, the progress of three residential construction projects are compared by aligning the starting dates.  If these three home construction projects were measured with the same PV valuations, the ''relative'' schedule performance of the projects can be easily compared.\n\n== Making earned value schedule metrics concordant with the CPM schedule ==\nThe actual critical path is ultimately the determining factor of every project's duration. Because earned value schedule metrics take no account of critical path data, big budget activities that are not on the critical path have the potential to dwarf the impact of performing small budget critical path activities. This can lead to \"gaming\" the SV and SPI metrics by ignoring critical path activities in favor of big budget activities that may have lots of float. This can sometimes even lead to performing activities out-of-sequence just to improve the schedule tracking metrics, which can cause major problems with quality.\n\nA simple two-step process has been suggested to fix this:\n# Create a second earned value baseline strictly for schedule, with the weighted activities and milestones on the as-late-as-possible dates of the backward pass of the critical path algorithm, where there is no float.\n# Allow earned value credit for schedule metrics to be taken no earlier than the reporting period during which the activity is scheduled unless it is on the project's current critical path.\n\nIn this way, the distorting aspect of float would be eliminated. There would be no benefit to performing a non-critical activity with lots of float until it is due in proper sequence. Also, an activity would not generate a negative schedule variance until it had used up its float. Under this method, one way of gaming the schedule metrics would be eliminated. The only way of generating a positive schedule variance (or SPI over 1.0) would be by completing work on the current critical path ahead of schedule, which is in fact the only way for a project to get ahead of schedule.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Devaux\n  | first = Stephen A.\n  | title = Managing Projects as Investments: Earned Value to Business Value\n  | publisher = CRC Press\n  | year = 2014\n  | pages = 160\u2013171\n  | isbn = 978-1-4822-1270-9 }}\n</ref>\n \n{{See also|Earned schedule}}\n\n== Advanced implementations (integrating cost, schedule and technical performance) ==\nIn addition to managing technical and schedule performance, large and complex projects require that cost performance be monitored and reviewed at regular intervals.  To measure cost performance, planned value (or BCWS - [[Budgeted cost of work scheduled|Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled]]) and earned value (or BCWP - Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) must be in units of currency (the same units that actual costs are measured.)  In large implementations, the planned value curve is commonly called a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) and may be arranged in control accounts, summary-level planning packages, planning packages and work packages.  In large projects, establishing control accounts is the primary method of delegating responsibility and authority to various parts of the performing organization.  Control accounts are cells of a [[Responsibility assignment matrix|responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix]], which is the intersection of the project WBS and the [[organization chart|organizational breakdown structure]] (OBS).  Control accounts are assigned to Control Account Managers (CAMs).  Large projects require more elaborate processes for controlling baseline revisions, more thorough integration with subcontractor EVM systems, and more elaborate management of procured materials.\n\nIn the United States, the primary standard for full-featured EVM systems is the ANSI/EIA-748A standard, published in May 1998 and reaffirmed in August 2002.  The standard defines 32 criteria for full-featured EVM system compliance.  As of the year 2007, a draft of ANSI/EIA-748B, a revision to the original is available from ANSI.  Other countries have established similar standards.\n\nIn addition to using BCWS and BCWP, prior to 1998 implementations often use the term actual cost of work performed (ACWP) instead of AC.  Additional acronyms and formulas include:\n\n; Budget at completion (BAC)\n: The total planned value (PV or BCWS) at the end of the project.  If a project has a management reserve (MR), it is typically <em>not</em> included in the BAC, and respectively, in the performance measurement baseline.\n; Cost variance (CV)\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nCV = EV - AC\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n: CV greater than 0 is good (under budget).\n; Cost performance index (CPI)\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nCPI = {EV\\over AC}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n: CPI greater than 1 is favourable (under budget):\n: < 1 means that the cost of completing the work is higher than planned (bad);\n: = 1 means that the cost of completing the work is right on plan (good);\n: > 1 means that the cost of completing the work is less than planned (good or sometimes bad).\n: Having a CPI that is very high (in some cases, very high is only 1.2) may mean that the plan was too conservative, and thus a very high number may in fact not be good, as the CPI is being measured against a poor baseline.  Management or the customer may be upset with the planners as an overly conservative baseline ties up available funds for other purposes, and the baseline is also used for manpower planning.\n; Estimate at completion (EAC)\n: EAC is the manager's projection of total cost of the project at completion.\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nEAC = AC + {(BAC-EV)\\over CPI} = {BAC \\over CPI}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n: This formula is based on the assumption, that the performance of the project (or rather a deviation of the actual performance from a baseline) to date gives a good indication of what a performance (or rather deviation of a performance from a baseline) will be in the future. In other words this formula is using statistics of the project to date to predict future results. Therefore it has to be used carefully, when the nature of the project in the future is likely to be different from the one to date (e.g. performance of the project compare to baseline at the design phase may not be a good indication of what it will be during a construction phase).\n; Estimate to complete (ETC)\n: ETC is the estimate to complete the remaining work of the project.  ETC must be based on objective measures of the outstanding work remaining, typically based on the measures or estimates used to create the original planned value (PV) profile, including any adjustments to predict performance based on historical performance, actions being taken to improve performance, or acknowledgement of degraded performance.\n: While algebraically, ETC = EAC-AC is correct, ETC should <em>never</em> be computed using either EAC or AC.  In the following equation,\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nEAC = AC + ETC\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n: ETC is the independent variable, EAC is the dependent variable, and AC is fixed based on expenditures to date.  ETC should always be reported truthfully to reflect the project team estimate to complete the outstanding work.  If ETC pushes EAC to exceed BAC, then project management skills are employed to either recommend performance improvements or scope change, but never force ETC to give the \"correct\" answer so that EAC=BAC.  Managing project activities to keep the project within budget is a human factors activity, not a mathematical function.\n; To-complete performance index (TCPI)\n: The TCPI provides a projection of the anticipated performance required to achieve either the BAC or the EAC.  TCPI indicates the future required cost efficiency needed to achieve a target BAC (Budget At Complete) or EAC (Estimate At Complete).  Any significant difference between CPI, the cost performance to date, and the TCPI, the cost performance needed to meet the BAC or the EAC, should be accounted for by management in their forecast of the final cost.\n: For the TCPI based on BAC (describing the performance required to meet the original BAC budgeted total):\n:: <math>TCPI_{BAC} = { BAC - EV \\over BAC - AC }</math>\n: or for the TCPI based on EAC (describing the performance required to meet a new, revised budget total EAC):\n:: <math>TCPI_{EAC} = { BAC - EV \\over EAC - AC }</math>\n: This implies, that if revised budget (EAC) is calculated using Earned Value methodology formula (BAC/CPI), then at the moment, when TCPI based on EAC is first time calculated, it will always be equal to CPI of a project at that moment.  This happens because when EAC is calculated using formula BAC/CPI it is assumed, that cost performance of the remaining part of the project will be the same as the cost performance of the project to date.\n; Independent estimate at completion (IEAC)\n: The IEAC is a metric to project total cost using the performance to date to project overall performance.  This can be compared to the EAC, which is the manager's projection.\n:: <math>IEAC = \\sum AC + { \\left( BAC - \\sum EV \\right) \\over CPI }</math>\n\n== Limitations ==\nProponents of EVM note a number of issues with implementing it,<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Alleman\n | first = Glen\n | title = Herding Cats : Issues with Deploying Earned Value Management\n | url = http://herdingcats.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/06/issues-with-deploying-earned-value-management.html\n | date = 2012-06-02\n | accessdate = 2013-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Schulze\n  | first = E.\n  | title = How Earned Value Management is Limited\n  | url = http://www.brighthubpm.com/monitoring-projects/10056-how-earned-value-management-is-limited/\n  | date = 2010-06-21\n  | accessdate = 2013-04-04}}\n</ref> and further limitations may be inherent to the concept itself.\n\nBecause EVM requires quantification of a project plan, it is often perceived to be inapplicable to discovery-driven or [[Agile software development]] projects.  For example, it may be impossible to plan certain [[research]] projects far in advance, because research itself uncovers some opportunities (research paths) and actively eliminates others.  However, another school of thought holds that all work can be planned, even if in weekly [[timeboxing|timeboxes]] or other short [[iterative development|increments]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nTraditional EVM is not intended for non-discrete (continuous) effort.  In traditional EVM standards, non-discrete effort is called \"level of effort\" (LOE).  If a project plan contains a significant portion of LOE, and the LOE is intermixed with discrete effort, EVM results will be contaminated.<ref>{{cite web\n  | authorlink = http://guidebook.dcma.mil/\n  | title = The Guide\n  | publisher = Defense Contracting Management Agency\n  | url = http://guidebook.dcma.mil/79/evhelp/perform.htm#Level%20of%20Effort%20(LOE)\n  | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}</ref>  This is another area of EVM research.\n\nTraditional definitions of EVM typically assume that [[project accounting]] and [[project network|project network schedule management]] are prerequisites to achieving any benefit from EVM.  Many small projects don't satisfy either of these prerequisites, but they too can benefit from EVM, as described for [[Earned Value Management#Simple implementations (emphasizing only technical performance)|simple implementations]], above.  Other projects can be planned with a project network, but do not have access to true and timely actual cost data. In practice, the collection of true and timely actual cost data can be the most difficult aspect of EVM. Such projects can benefit from EVM, as described for [[Earned Value Management#Intermediate implementations (integrating technical and schedule performance)|intermediate implementations]], above, and [[Earned Schedule]].\n\nAs a means of overcoming objections to EVM's lack of connection to qualitative performance issues, the [[Naval Air Systems Command]] (NAVAIR) PEO(A) organization initiated a project in the late 1990s to integrate true technical achievement into EVM projections by utilizing risk profiles.  These risk profiles anticipate opportunities that may be revealed and possibly be exploited as development and testing proceeds.  The published research resulted in a Technical Performance Management (TPM) methodology and software application that is still used by many DoD agencies in informing EVM estimates with technical achievement.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Pisano\n  | first = Nicholas D.\n  | title = Technical Performance Measurement, Earned Value, and Risk Management: An Integrated Diagnostic Tool for Program Management\n  | publisher = Defense Acquisition University Acquisition Research Symposium\n  | year = 1999\n  | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA404646  | accessdate = 2018-02-06 | format = PDF }}</ref>\nThe research was peer-reviewed and was the recipient of the Defense Acquisition University Acquisition Research Symposium 1997 Acker Award for excellence in the exchange of information in the field of acquisition research.\n\nThere is the difficulty inherent for any periodic monitoring of synchronizing data timing: actual deliveries, actual invoicing, and the date the EVM analysis is done are all independent, so that some items have arrived but their invoicing has not and by the time analysis is delivered the data will likely be weeks behind events.  This may limit EVM to a less tactical or less definitive role where use is combined with other forms to explain why or add recent news and manage future expectations.\n\nThere is a measurement limitation for how precisely EVM can be used, stemming from classic conflict between [[accuracy and precision]], as the mathematics can calculate deceptively far beyond the precision of the measurements of data and the approximation that is the plan [[estimation]].  The limitation on estimation is commonly understood (such as the [[ninety-ninety rule]] in software) but is not visible in any [[margin of error]].  The limitations on measurement are largely a form of [[Discretization error|digitization error]] as EVM measurements ultimately can be no finer than by item, which may be the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] terminal element size, to the scale of reporting period, typically end summary of a month, and by the means of delivery measure.  (The delivery measure may be actual deliveries, may include estimates of partial work done at the end of month subject to estimation limits, and typically does not include QC check or risk offsets.)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Critical chain project management]]\n* [[Earned schedule]]\n* [[List of project management topics]]\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Humphreys, Gary (2001).

The electron beam is produced by an [[electron gun]], commonly fitted with a [[tungsten]] filament [[cathode]] as the electron source. The electron beam is accelerated by an [[anode]] typically at +100 k[[Electronvolt|eV]] (40 to 400 keV) with respect to the cathode, focused by [[electrostatic]] and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] lenses, and transmitted through the specimen that is in part transparent to electrons and in part [[Electron scattering|scatters]] them out of the beam. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by the [[objective lens]] system of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the \"image\") may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a [[phosphor]] or [[scintillator]] material such as zinc sulfide. Alternatively, the image can be photographically recorded by exposing a [[photographic film]] or [[photographic plate|plate]] directly to the electron beam, or a high-resolution phosphor may be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a [[fibre optic]] light-guide to the sensor of a [[digital camera]]. The image detected by the digital camera may be displayed on a monitor or computer.\n\nThe resolution of TEMs is limited primarily by [[spherical aberration]], but a new generation of hardware correctors can reduce spherical aberration to increase the resolution in [[high-resolution transmission electron microscopy]] (HRTEM) to below 0.5 [[angstrom]] (50 [[picometre]]s),<ref name=\"erni\" /> enabling magnifications above 50 million times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/scale_of_things.html |title=The Scale of Things |date=2006-05-26 |publisher=Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201175106/http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/scale_of_things.html |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}</ref> The ability of HRTEM to determine the positions of atoms within materials is useful for nano-technologies research and development.<ref>{{cite journal|author1 = O'Keefe MA |author2 = Allard LF |title = Sub-\u00c5ngstrom Electron Microscopy for Sub-\u00c5ngstrom Nano-Metrology|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/821768-E3YVgN/native/821768.pdf |publisher=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information \u2013 Sponsored by OSTI |format=PDF |date=2004-01-18}}</ref>\n\nTransmission electron microscopes are often used in [[electron diffraction]] mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen need not be a single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the [[phase problem]] faced by the X-ray crystallographers after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder.\n\nOne major disadvantage of the transmission electron microscope is the need for extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a [[focused ion beam]]. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers, and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.\n\n===Serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM)===\nOne application of TEM is serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM), for example in analyzing the connectivity in volumetric samples of brain tissue by imaging many thin sections in sequence.<ref>Yoo, Inwan, David GC Hildebrand, Willie F. Tobin, Wei-Chung Allen Lee, and Won-Ki Jeong.

Springer, Cham, 2017.</ref>\n\n=== Scanning electron microscope (SEM) ===\n\n[[File:Scanning Electron Microscope.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|Operating principe of a scanning electron microscope]]\n\n{{Main|Scanning electron microscope}}\n[[File:Bacillus subtilis image.jpg|thumb|Image of bacillus subtilis taken with a 1960s electron microscope]]\nThe SEM produces images by probing the specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular area of the specimen ([[raster scan]]ning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy by a variety of mechanisms. The lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat, emission of [[secondary emission|low-energy secondary electrons]] and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission ([[cathodoluminescence]]) or [[X-ray]] emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by an SEM maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. In the SEM image of an ant shown below and to the right, the image was constructed from signals produced by a secondary electron detector, the normal or conventional imaging mode in most SEMs.\n\nGenerally, the image resolution of an SEM is lower than that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high-resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with [[environmental scanning electron microscope]]s (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.[[File:Ant SEM.jpg|thumb|right|An image of an [[ant]] in a scanning electron microscope]]\n\n=== Color ===\nIn their most common configurations, electron microscopes produce images with a single brightness value per pixel, with the results usually rendered in [[grayscale]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy|title=Under the Microscope: A Hidden World Revealed|year=1987|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-39940-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30A5AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA11|page=11}}</ref> However, often these images are then colorized through the use of feature-detection software, or simply by hand-editing using a graphics editor.

Examples are the [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and [[Cathodoluminescence microscope]] (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced [[luminescence]] in (for example) geological specimens.  In SEM systems using these detectors, it is common to color code the signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared.  Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal, which is not modified in any way.\n\n=== Reflection electron microscope (REM) ===\nIn the '''reflection electron microscope''' (REM) as in the TEM, an electron beam is incident on a surface but instead of using the transmission (TEM) or secondary electrons (SEM), the reflected beam of [[Elastic scattering|elastically scattered electrons]] is detected. This technique is typically coupled with [[RHEED|reflection high energy electron diffraction]] (RHEED) and ''reflection high-energy loss spectroscopy (RHELS)''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Another variation is spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy ([[SPLEEM]]), which is used for looking at the microstructure of [[magnetic domain]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncem.lbl.gov/frames/spleem.html |publisher=National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) |title=SPLEEM |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529185331/http://ncem.lbl.gov/frames/spleem.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) ===\n{{Main|Scanning transmission electron microscopy}}\nThe STEM rasters a focused incident probe across a specimen that (as with the TEM) has been thinned to facilitate detection of electrons scattered ''through'' the specimen. The high resolution of the TEM is thus possible in STEM. The focusing action (and aberrations) occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the STEM, but afterward in the TEM. The STEMs use of SEM-like beam rastering simplifies [[annular dark-field imaging]], and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. Often TEM can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as TEM and STEM.\n\n== Sample preparation ==\n[[File:Golden insect 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|An insect [[sputter coating|coated in gold]] for viewing with a scanning electron microscope]]\nMaterials to be viewed under an electron microscope may require processing to produce a suitable sample. The technique required varies depending on the specimen and the analysis required:\n* ''Chemical [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]'' \u2013 for biological specimens aims to stabilize the specimen's mobile macromolecular structure by chemical crosslinking of [[protein]]s with [[aldehyde]]s such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[glutaraldehyde]], and [[lipid]]s with [[osmium tetroxide]].\n* ''[[Negative stain]]'' \u2013 suspensions containing nanoparticles or fine biological material (such as viruses and bacteria) are briefly mixed with a dilute solution of an electron-opaque solution such as ammonium molybdate, uranyl acetate (or formate), or phosphotungstic acid. This mixture is applied to a suitably coated EM grid, blotted, then allowed to dry. Viewing of this preparation in the TEM should be carried out without delay for best results. The method is important in microbiology for fast but crude morphological identification, but can also be used as the basis for high-resolution 3D reconstruction using EM tomography methodology when carbon films are used for support. Negative staining is also used for observation of nanoparticles.\n* ''[[Cryofixation]]'' \u2013 freezing a specimen so rapidly, in [[liquid ethane]], and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even [[liquid helium]] temperatures, so that the water forms [[Amorphous ice|vitreous (non-crystalline) ice]]. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called [[cryo-electron microscopy]] has branched from this technique. With the development of [[cryo-electron microscopy]] of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), it is now possible to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n* ''Dehydration'' \u2013 or replacement of [[water]] with organic solvents such as [[ethanol]] or [[acetone]], followed by [[critical point drying]] or infiltration with embedding [[resins]]. Also [[freeze drying]].\n* ''Embedding, biological specimens'' \u2013 after dehydration, tissue for observation in the transmission electron microscope is embedded so it can be sectioned ready for viewing. To do this the tissue is passed through a 'transition solvent' such as [[propylene oxide]] (epoxypropane) or [[acetone]] and then infiltrated with an [[epoxy]] [[resin]] such as [[Araldite]], Epon, or [[Durcupan]];<ref>{{cite news\n  |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n  |author1 =Luft, J.H.\n  |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n  |volume=9\n  |issue=2\n  |page=409\n  |year=1961\n  |pmc=2224998|pmid=13764136}}</ref> tissues may also be embedded directly in water-miscible [[acrylic resin]]. After the resin has been polymerized (hardened) the sample is thin sectioned (ultrathin sections) and [[staining|stained]] \u2013 it is then ready for viewing.\n* ''Embedding, materials'' \u2013 after embedding in resin, the specimen is usually ground and polished to a mirror-like finish using ultra-fine abrasives. The polishing process must be performed carefully to minimize scratches and other polishing artifacts that reduce image quality.\n* ''Metal shadowing'' \u2013 Metal (e.g. [[platinum]]) is evaporated from an overhead electrode and applied to the surface of a biological sample at an angle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R.

These can be cut on an [[ultramicrotome]] with a glass or [[diamond]] knife to produce ultra-thin sections about 60\u201390&nbsp;nm thick. Disposable [[glass knives]] are also used because they can be made in the lab and are much cheaper.\n* ''[[Staining]]'' \u2013 uses heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[uranium]] or [[tungsten]] to scatter imaging electrons and thus give contrast between different structures, since many (especially biological) materials are nearly \"transparent\" to electrons (weak phase objects). In biology, specimens can be stained \"en bloc\" before embedding and also later after sectioning.

The second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve the stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile \"pre-shadowed\" metal replica of the fracture surface is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, [[hypochlorite]] solution or [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]] detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.\n* ''Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling (FRIL)'' \u2013 the freeze-fracture method has been modified to allow the identification of the components of the fracture face by immunogold labeling. Instead of removing all the underlying tissue of the thawed replica as the final step before viewing in the microscope the tissue thickness is minimized during or after the fracture process. The thin layer of tissue remains bound to the metal replica so it can be immunogold labeled with antibodies to the structures of choice. The thin layer of the original specimen on the replica with gold attached allows the identification of structures in the fracture plane.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1987-03-01|title=Immunolocalization of MP70 in lens fiber 16-17-nm intercellular junctions|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=104|issue=3|pages=565\u2013572|pmc=2114558|pmid=3818793|author1=Gruijters|first1=W.

The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible the observation of non-conductive specimens without coating.  Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.\n\nSmall, stable specimens such as [[carbon nanotubes]], [[diatom]] frustules and small mineral crystals (asbestos fibres, for example) require no special treatment before being examined in the electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens have to be prepared in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in ''[[Visual artifact#In microscopy|artifacts]]'', but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of [[cryofixation|cryofixed]], vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.<ref

For birds extinct in Late Quaternary prehistoric times and usually known from specimens not completely fossilized, see [[List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species]].''\n\nOver 190 species of [[bird]]s have become [[Extinction|extinct]] since 1500, and the rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by [[Hawaii]], where 30% of all known recently extinct bird [[taxa]] originally lived. Other areas, such as [[Guam]], have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced [[brown tree snake]].\n\nCurrently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.\n\nIsland species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The disproportionate number of [[Rallidae|rails]] in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in [[List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species]].\n\nThe extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the [[San Benedicto rock wren]] is possibly the most extreme example&mdash;its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists.\n\n[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a dodo, with a red parrot on its left side, and a blue one at its right|The famous \"Edwards' [[Dodo]]\", painted by [[Roelant Savery]] in 1626]]\n\n==Extinct bird species==\n\n===[[Aepyornithiformes]]===\n* [[Elephant bird]], ''Aepyornis maximus'' and/or ''A. medius'' (Madagascar, 16th century?)\n\n===[[Dinornithiformes]]===\n* [[Upland moa]], ''Megalapteryx didinus'' (South Island, New Zealand, late 15th century?)\n===[[Casuariiformes]]===\n[[Image:Dromaius parvulus.jpg|thumb|[[Kangaroo Island emu]]]]\n* [[King Island emu]], ''Dromaius minor'' (King Island, Australia, 1822)\n*:Extinct in the wild c.&nbsp;1805, the last captive specimen died in 1822 in the [[Jardin des Plantes]].\n* [[Kangaroo Island emu]], ''Dromaius baudinianus'' (Kangaroo Island, Australia, 1827)\n\n===[[Apterygiformes]]=== \n* West Coast spotted kiwi, ''Apteryx occidentalis'' (South Island, New Zealand, c.&nbsp;1900)\n*:A doubtful form known from a single bird; may be a [[little spotted kiwi]] subspecies or a hybrid between that species and the [[rowi]].\n\n===[[Anseriformes]]===\n[[Image:Camptorynchus labradoriusNHDP078CB.jpg|thumb|[[Labrador duck]]]]\n[[Duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s\n* [[Crested shelduck]], ''Tadorna cristata'' (Northeast Asia, late 20th century?)\n*:A [[Relict (biology)|relict species]] from Northeast Asia.

Its decline was caused by the depredations of introduced [[brown tree snake]]s.\n* [[Ry\u016bky\u016b kingfisher]], ''Todiramphus cinnamominus miyakoensis'' (Miyako-jima, Ryukyu Islands, late 19th century)\n:Previously considered as full species but better regarded as subspecies of the [[Micronesian kingfisher]] ''Todiramphus cinnamominus''. Only seen once by scientists, in 1887; the specimen taken is somewhat damaged, making identification by other than molecular analysis difficult. It is now thought likely that the specimen came from Guam, where the nominate subspecies was distributed, rather than Miyako, which would make this subspecies invalid.\n* Javan blue-banded kingfisher, ''Alcedo euryzona euryzona'' (Java, Indonesia, extant)\n:The nominate subspecies of the [[blue-banded kingfisher]]; the last specimen was taken in 1937 and the taxon has been considered extinct, but it was mist-netted five times in 2000-2001 at Halimun National Park, which has not undergone much change since.\n* Guadalcanal little kingfisher, ''Alcedo pusilla aolae'' (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, ?)\n:[[Little kingfisher]] subspecies\n* Sakarha pygmy kingfisher, ''Ispidina madagascariensis dilutus'' (Southwest Madagascar, late 20th century?)\n:This subspecies of the [[Madagascar pygmy kingfisher]] is only known from one specimen taken in 1974 in an area where most habitat had already been lost.

Placement in Sylviidae doubtful.\n* Fayyum warbler, ''Sylvia melanocephala/momus norissae'' (Egypt, 1939)\n:A doubtfully distinct [[Sardinian warbler]] subspecies. It has not been recorded since 1939.\n\n'''[[Zosteropidae]]''' &ndash; white-eyes.

Her plantation manager and husband-to-be was Phineas Miller, another Connecticut migrant and Yale graduate (class of 1785), who would become Whitney's business partner.\n\n==Career==\nWhitney is most famous for two innovations which came to have significant impacts on the United States in the mid-19th century: the [[cotton gin]] (1793) and his advocacy of [[interchangeable parts]]. In the South, the cotton gin revolutionized the way cotton was [[harvest]]ed and reinvigorated slavery. In the North the adoption of interchangeable parts revolutionized the manufacturing industry, and contributed greatly to the U.S. victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3497 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Eli Whitney in Georgia].

It shows sawtooth gin blades, which were not part of Whitney's original patent.]]\n[[File:Cotton gin EWM 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A cotton gin on display at the [[Eli Whitney Museum]].]]\n\nThe cotton gin is a mechanical device that removes the seeds from cotton, a process that had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word ''gin'' is short for ''engine.'' While staying at Mulberry Grove, Whitney constructed several ingenious household devices which led Mrs Greene to introduce him to some businessmen who were discussing the desirability of a machine to\nseparate the short staple upland cotton from its seeds, work that was then done by hand at the rate of a pound of lint a day. In a few weeks Whitney produced a model.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2246&dat=19180427&id=5PclAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7052,6418392|title=Cat Gave Him Idea.|last=Gettysburg Compiler - Google News Archive Search|first=|date=April 27, 1918|website=news.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n\nA single cotton gin could generate up to {{convert|55|lb}} of cleaned cotton daily. This contributed to the economic development of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] of the United States, a prime cotton growing area; some historians believe that this invention allowed for the [[History of slavery in the United States|African slavery system]] in the Southern United States to become more sustainable at a critical point in its development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/whitneycottongin.html|title=Eli Whitney: The Invention of the Cotton Gin|website=www.juliantrubin.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}</ref>\n\nWhitney received a patent (later numbered as X72) for his cotton gin on March 14, 1794,<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent for Cotton Gin|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=khh&AN=64084521&site=eds-live&scope=site|website=History Reference Center|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref> but it was not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. Rather, like the proprietors of [[gristmill|grist]] and [[sawmill]]s, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton \u2013 two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of [[History of patent law|patent law]], made [[Patent infringement|infringement]] inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale. Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits (one patent, later annulled, was granted in 1796 to Hogden Holmes for a gin which substituted circular saws for the spikes){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797.<ref name=\"MIT\" /> One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney's first design. There is significant evidence that the design flaws were solved by his sponsor, Mrs. Greene, but Whitney gave her no public credit or recognition.<ref name=EWnameProject>[http://peoplenamedeliwhitney.blogspot.com/2009/10/eli-whitney-really-famous-one.html Eli Whitney Project]  A website for The Eli Whitney Project</ref>\n\nAfter validation of the patent, the legislature of South Carolina voted $50,000 for the rights for that state, while North Carolina levied a license tax for five years, from which about $30,000 was realized. There is a claim that Tennessee paid, perhaps, $10,000.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nWhile the cotton gin did not earn Whitney the fortune he had hoped for, it did give him fame. It has been argued by some historians that Whitney's cotton gin was an important if unintended cause of the American Civil War. After Whitney's invention, the [[Plantations in the American South|plantation slavery]] industry was rejuvenated, eventually culminating in the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/civilwarmenu/a/cause_civil_war.htm |title=Top Five Causes of the Civil War |publisher=Americanhistory.about.com |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref>\n\nAnd the cotton gin transformed Southern agriculture and the national economy.<ref name=EWmuseum>[http://www.eliwhitney.org/ The Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop]  A website for The Eli Whitney Museum in [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden, CT.]]</ref> Southern cotton found ready markets in Europe and in the burgeoning [[cotton mill|textile mill]]s of [[New England]].

It became the U.S.'s chief export, representing over half the value of U.S. exports from 1820 to 1860.\n\nParadoxically, the cotton gin, a labor-saving device, helped preserve [[slavery]] in the U.S. Before the 1790s, slave labor was primarily employed in growing rice, tobacco, and [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]], none of which were especially profitable any more. Neither was cotton, due to the difficulty of seed removal. But with the gin, growing cotton with slave labor became highly profitable \u2013 the chief source of wealth in the American South, and the basis of frontier settlement from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to Texas. \"[[King Cotton]]\" became a dominant economic force, and slavery was sustained as a key institution of Southern society.\n\n===Interchangeable parts===\n{{main|Interchangeable parts}}\n[[File:Eli Whitney's first contract as a gunfounder signed by Oliver Ellsworth 1786.jpg|thumb|upright|First contract of Eli Whitney as a firearms manufacturer, 1798. Signed by [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]].]]\nEli Whitney has often been incorrectly credited with inventing the idea of interchangeable parts, which he championed for years as a maker of [[musket]]s; however, the idea predated Whitney, and Whitney's role in it was one of promotion and popularizing, not invention.<ref name=\"Bryson\">{{cite book|last1=Byson|first1=Bill|title=At Home: A Short History of Private Life|date=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780767919395|page=412}}</ref> Successful implementation of the idea eluded Whitney until near the end of his life, occurring first in others' armories.\n\nAttempts at interchangeability of parts can be traced back as far as the [[Punic Wars]] through both archaeological remains of boats now in Museo Archeologico Baglio Anselmi and contemporary written accounts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In modern times the idea developed over decades among many people. An early leader was [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]], an 18th-century French [[artillery|artillerist]] who created a fair amount of [[standardization]] of artillery pieces, although not true interchangeability of parts. He inspired others, including [[Honor\u00e9 Blanc]] and [[Louis de Tousard]], to work further on the idea, and on shoulder weapons as well as artillery. In the 19th century these efforts produced the \"armory system,\" or [[American system of manufacturing]]. Certain other New Englanders, including [[Captain John H. Hall]] and [[Simeon North]], arrived at successful interchangeability before Whitney's armory did. The Whitney armory finally succeeded not long after his death in 1825.\n\nThe motives behind Whitney's acceptance of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney was on the verge of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in [[debt]]. His [[New Haven]] cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The [[French Revolution]] had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time.  Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], sent him a \"foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques,\" possibly one of Honor\u00e9 Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.\n\n[[File:Eli Whitney Gun Factory William Giles Munson 1827.jpg|thumb|250px|Whitney's gun factory in 1827]]\nIn May 1798, Congress voted for legislation that would use eight hundred thousand dollars in order to pay for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted. It offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for the person that was able to accurately produce arms for the government. Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed it promised, he accepted the offer. Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until 1809, using multiple excuses for the delay. Recently, historians have found that during 1801\u20131806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin.<ref name=\"Baida1987\"/>\n\nAlthough Whitney's demonstration of 1801 appeared to show the feasibility of creating interchangeable parts, [[Merritt Roe Smith]] concludes that it was \"staged\" and \"duped government authorities\" into believing that he had been successful. The charade gained him time and resources toward achieving that goal.<ref name=\"Baida1987\"/>\n\nWhen the government complained that Whitney's price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, he was able to calculate an actual price per musket by including [[fixed cost]]s such as insurance and [[machinery]], which the government had not accounted for. He thus made early contributions to both the concepts of [[cost accounting]], and [[efficiency (economics)|economic efficiency]] in manufacturing.\n\n===Milling machine===\n{{main|Milling machine}}\n\nMachine tool historian Joseph W. Roe credited Whitney with inventing the first [[milling machine]] circa 1818. Subsequent work by other historians (Woodbury; Smith; Muir; Battison [cited by Baida<ref name=\"Baida1987\">{{Cite journal | last = Baida | first = Peter |date=May\u2013June 1987 | title = Eli Whitney's Other Talent | journal = American Heritage | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/eli-whitney%E2%80%99s-other-talent?page=show | id = | accessdate =May 30, 2013 | postscript =. }}</ref>]) suggests that Whitney was among a group of contemporaries all developing milling machines at about the same time (1814 to 1818), and that the others were more important to the innovation than Whitney was. (The machine that excited Roe may not have been built until 1825, after Whitney's death.) Therefore, no one person can properly be described as the inventor of the milling machine.\n\n==Later life and legacy==\n[[File:Eli Whitney 1940 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|upright|Eli Whitney on US Postage [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|Issue of 1940]], 1c]]\n[[File:EliWhitneyGraveSouthSideGroveStCemeteryNewHavenCT04152008.JPG|thumb|right|South side of Eli Whitney monument in the [[Grove Street Cemetery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]]]]\n\nDespite his humble origins, Whitney was keenly aware of the value of social and political connections. In building his arms business, he took full advantage of the access that his status as a Yale alumnus gave him to other well-placed graduates, such as [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] (class of 1778), and [[James Hillhouse]], a New Haven developer and political leader.\n\nHis 1817 marriage to Henrietta Edwards, granddaughter of the famed [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], daughter of [[Pierpont Edwards]], head of the Democratic Party in Connecticut, and first cousin of Yale's president, [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], the state's leading [[Federalist]], further tied him to Connecticut's [[ruling elite]]. In a business dependent on government contracts, such connections were essential to success.\n\nWhitney died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 8, 1825, in New Haven, Connecticut, just a month after his 59th birthday. He left a widow and his four children behind. During the course of his illness, he invented and constructed several devices to mechanically ease his pain. These devices, drawings of which are in his collected papers, were effective but were never manufactured for use of others due to his heirs' reluctance to trade in \"indelicate\" items.\n\nThe [[Eli Whitney Students Program]],  Yale University's admissions program for non-traditional students, is named in honor of Whitney, who only began his studies there when he was 23,<ref name=\"Yale Admissions\">{{cite web |url=http://admissions.yale.edu/eli-whitney |title=Eli Whitney Students Program \u2013 A Program for Non-Traditional Students |work=Yale College Admissions |publisher=[[Yale University]] |location=New Haven, CT |accessdate=November 21, 2011 }}</ref> but went on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in just three years.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Whitney family]]\n*[[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n*[[Eli Whitney Museum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n*Battison, Edwin.

The electromagnetic field extends indefinitely throughout space and describes the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. It is one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature (the others are [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction]] and [[strong interaction]]).\n\nThe field can be viewed as the combination of an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]]. The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the sources of the field. The way in which charges and currents interact with the electromagnetic field is described by [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz force law]].<ref>Purcell. p5-11;p61;p277-296</ref> The force created by the electric field is much stronger than the  force created by the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p235: We then calculate the electric field due to a charge moving with constant velocity; it does not equal the spherically symmetric Coulomb field.</ref>\n\nFrom a [[Classical physics|classical]] perspective in the [[history of electromagnetism]], the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous field, propagated in a wavelike manner; whereas from the perspective of [[quantum field theory]], the field is seen as quantized, being composed of individual [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s.\n\n==Structure==\nThe electromagnetic field may be viewed in two distinct ways: a continuous structure or a discrete structure.\n\n===Continuous structure===\nClassically, electric and magnetic fields are thought of as being produced by smooth motions of charged objects. For example, oscillating charges produce electric and magnetic fields that may be viewed in a 'smooth', continuous, wavelike fashion. In this case, energy is viewed as being transferred continuously through the electromagnetic field between any two locations. For instance, the metal atoms in a [[radio]] [[transmitter]] appear to transfer energy continuously. This view is useful to a certain extent (radiation of low frequency), but problems are found at high frequencies (see [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Discrete structure===\nThe electromagnetic field may be thought of in a more 'coarse' way. Experiments reveal that in some circumstances electromagnetic energy transfer is better described as being carried in the form of packets called [[quantum|quanta]] (in this case, [[photon]]s) with a fixed [[frequency]]. Planck's relation links the [[photon energy]] ''E'' of a photon to its frequency \u03bd through the equation:<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer, James N.|display-authors=etal|title=Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2010|isbn=9780470587119|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRfcVwFr17IC&pg=PA78}}</ref>\n\n:<math>E= \\, h \\, \\nu</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], and \u03bd is the frequency of the photon . Although modern quantum optics tells us that there also is a semi-classical explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]]\u2014the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces subjected to [[electromagnetic radiation]]\u2014the photon was historically (although not strictly necessarily) used to explain certain observations. It is found that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation (so long as one remains in the linear regime) increases only the number of electrons ejected, and has almost no effect on the energy distribution of their ejection. Only the frequency of the radiation is relevant to the energy of the ejected electrons.\n\nThis [[quantum]] picture of the electromagnetic field (which treats it as analogous to [[harmonic oscillators]]) has proven very successful, giving rise to [[quantum electrodynamics]], a [[quantum field theory]] describing the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with charged matter. It also gives rise to [[quantum optics]], which is different from quantum electrodynamics in that the matter itself is modelled using [[quantum mechanics]] rather than quantum field theory.\n\n==Dynamics==\nIn the past, [[Electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were thought to produce two different, unrelated types of field associated with their charge property. An [[electric field]] is produced when the charge is stationary with respect to an observer measuring the properties of the charge, and a [[magnetic field]] as well as an electric field is produced when the charge moves, creating an electric current with respect to this observer. Over time, it was realized that the electric and magnetic fields are better thought of as two parts of a greater whole \u2014 the electromagnetic field. Until 1820, when the Danish physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted|H. C. \u00d8rsted]] discovered the effect of electricity through a wire on a compass needle, electricity and magnetism had been viewed as unrelated phenomena {{citation needed|reason=This section was clearly written by someone with no historical knowledge and by this edit only a very basic fix has been performed|date=October 2015}}. In 1831, [[Michael Faraday]], one of the great thinkers of his time, made the seminal observation that time-varying magnetic fields could induce electric currents and then, in 1864, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published his famous paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]''.<ref>Maxwell 1864 5, page 499; also [[David J. Griffiths]] (1999), Introduction to electrodynamics, third Edition, ed. Prentice Hall, pp. 559-562\"(as quoted in Gabriela, 2009)</ref>\n\nOnce this electromagnetic field has been produced from a given charge distribution, other charged objects in this field will experience a force in a similar way that planets experience a force in the gravitational field of the sun. If these other charges and currents are comparable in size to the sources producing the above electromagnetic field, then a new net electromagnetic field will be produced. Thus, the electromagnetic field may be viewed as a dynamic entity that causes other charges and currents to move, and which is also affected by them. These interactions are described by [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz Force Law|Lorentz force law]]. This discussion ignores the [[radiation reaction force]].\n\n==Feedback loop==\nThe behavior of the electromagnetic field can be divided into four different parts of a loop:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n*the electric and magnetic fields are generated by electric charges,\n*the electric and magnetic fields interact with each other,\n*the electric and magnetic fields produce forces on electric charges,\n*the electric charges move in space.\n\nA common misunderstanding is that (a) the quanta of the fields act in the same manner as (b) the charged particles that generate the fields. In our everyday world, charged '''particles''', such as electrons, move slowly through matter with a [[drift velocity]] of a fraction of a centimeter (or inch) per second, but '''fields''' propagate at the [[speed of light]] - approximately 300 thousand kilometers (or 186 thousand miles) a second. The mundane speed difference between charged particles and field quanta is on the order of one to a million, more or less. [[Maxwell's equations]] relate (a) the presence and movement of charged particles with (b) the generation of fields. Those fields can then affect the force on, and can then move other slowly moving charged particles. Charged particles can move at relativistic speeds nearing field propagation speeds, but, as [[Einstein]] showed{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, this requires enormous field energies, which are not present in our everyday experiences with electricity, magnetism, matter, and time and space.\n\nThe feedback loop can be summarized in a list, including phenomena belonging to each part of the loop:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n*charged particles generate electric and magnetic fields\n*the fields interact with each other\n**changing electric field acts like a current, generating 'vortex' of magnetic field\n**[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday induction]]: changing magnetic field induces (negative) vortex of electric field\n**[[Lenz's law]]: negative feedback loop between electric and magnetic fields\n*fields act upon particles\n**Lorentz force: force due to electromagnetic field\n***electric force: same direction as electric field\n***magnetic force: perpendicular both to magnetic field and to velocity of charge\n*particles move\n**current is movement of particles\n*particles generate more electric and magnetic fields; cycle repeats\n\n==Mathematical description==\n{{main|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}\nThere are different mathematical ways of representing the electromagnetic field. The first one views the electric and magnetic fields as three-dimensional [[vector field]]s. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as '''E'''(x, y, z, t) ([[electric field]]) and '''B'''(x, y, z, t) ([[magnetic field]]).\n\nIf only the electric field ('''E''') is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an [[electrostatic field]]. Similarly, if only the magnetic field ('''B''') is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a [[magnetostatic field]]. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using [[Maxwell's equations]].<ref>Electromagnetic Fields (2nd Edition), Roald K. Wangsness, Wiley, 1986. {{ISBN|0-471-81186-6}} (intermediate level textbook)</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[special relativity]], physical laws became susceptible to the formalism of [[tensor]]s. Maxwell's equations can be written in tensor form, generally viewed by physicists as a more elegant means of expressing physical laws.\n\nThe behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or [[electrodynamics]] (electromagnetic fields), is governed by Maxwell's equations. In the vector field formalism, these are:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}</math> ([[Gauss's law]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0</math> ([[Gauss's law for magnetism]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}</math> ([[Faraday's law of induction#The Maxwell-Faraday equation|Faraday's law]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0\\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}</math> ([[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re law]])\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the charge density, which can (and often does) depend on time and position, <math>\\epsilon_0</math> is the [[permittivity]] of free space, <math>\\mu_0</math> is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of free space, and '''J''' is the current density vector, also a function of time and position. The units used above are the standard SI units. Inside a linear material, Maxwell's equations change by switching the permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question. Inside other materials which possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often represented by complex numbers, or tensors.\n\nThe [[Lorentz force law]] governs the interaction of the electromagnetic field with charged matter.\n\nWhen a field travels across to different media, the properties of the field change according to the various boundary conditions. These equations are derived from Maxwell's equations.\nThe tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields as they relate on the boundary of two media are as follows:<ref>Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics(2nd Edition), Joseph A.

Faraday's Law may be stated roughly as 'a changing magnetic field creates an electric field'. This is the principle behind the [[electric generator]].\n\nAmpere's Law roughly states that 'a changing electric field creates a magnetic field'. Thus, this law can be applied to generate a magnetic field and run an [[electric motor]].\n\n===Behavior of the fields in the absence of charges or currents===\n[[Maxwell's equations]] take the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]] in a volume of space not containing charges or currents ([[free space]]) \u2013 that is, where <math>\\rho</math> and '''J''' are zero. Under these conditions, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]:<ref>Field and Wave Electromagnetics (2nd Edition), David K.

The word 'force' is sometimes replaced by 'interaction' because modern [[particle physics]] models electromagnetism as an exchange of particles known as [[gauge boson]]s.\n\n===Electromagnetic and gravitational fields===\nSources of electromagnetic fields consist of two types of [[Charge (physics)|charge]] \u2013 positive and negative. This contrasts with the sources of the gravitational field, which are masses. Masses are sometimes described as ''gravitational charges'', the important feature of them being that there are only positive masses and no [[negative mass]]es. Further, gravity differs from electromagnetism in that positive masses attract other positive masses whereas same charges in electromagnetism repel each other.\n\nThe relative [[field strength|strengths]] and ranges of the four interactions and other information are tabulated below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Theory !! Interaction !! mediator !! Relative Magnitude !! Behavior !!

However the general case of a static EM field with both electric and magnetic components present, is the case that appears to most observers. Observers who see only an electric or magnetic field component of a static EM field, have the other (electric or magnetic) component suppressed, due to the special case of the immobile state of the charges that produce the EM field in that case. In such cases the other component becomes manifest in other observer frames.\n\nA consequence of this, is that any case that seems to consist of a \"pure\" static electric or magnetic field, can be converted to an EM field, with both E and M components present, by simply moving the observer into a [[frame of reference]] which is moving with regard to the frame in which only the \u201cpure\u201d electric or magnetic field appears. That is, a pure static electric field will show the familiar magnetic field associated with a current, in any [[frame of reference]] where the charge moves. Likewise, any new motion of a charge in a region that seemed previously to contain only a magnetic field, will show that the space now contains an electric field as well, which will be found to produces an additional Lorentz force upon the moving charge.\n\nThus, [[electrostatics]], as well as [[magnetism]] and [[magnetostatics]], are now seen as studies of the static EM field when a particular frame has been selected to suppress the other type of field, and since an EM field with both electric and magnetic will appear in any other frame, these \"simpler\" effects are merely the observer's. The \"applications\" of all such non-time varying (static) fields are discussed in the main articles linked in this section.\n\n===Time-varying EM fields in Maxwell\u2019s equations===\n{{main|near and far field|near field optics|virtual particle|dielectric heating|Electromagnetic induction}}\nAn EM field that varies in time has two \u201ccauses\u201d in Maxwell\u2019s equations. One is charges and currents (so-called \u201csources\u201d), and the other cause for an E or M field is a change in the other type of field (this last cause also appears in \u201cfree space\u201d very far from currents and charges).\n\nAn electromagnetic field very far from currents and charges (sources) is called [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EMR) since it radiates from the charges and currents in the source, and has no \"feedback\" effect on them, and is also not affected directly by them in the present time (rather, it is indirectly produced by a sequences of changes in fields radiating out from them in the past). EMR consists of the radiations in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet light]], [[X-rays]], and [[gamma ray]]s. The many commercial applications of these radiations are discussed in the named and linked articles.\n\nA notable application of visible light is that this type of energy from the Sun powers all life on Earth that either makes or uses oxygen.\n\nA changing electromagnetic field which is physically close to currents and charges (see [[near and far field]] for a definition of \u201cclose\u201d) will have a [[dipole]] characteristic that is dominated by either a changing [[electric dipole]], or a changing [[magnetic dipole]]. This type of dipole field near sources is called an electromagnetic ''near-field''.\n\nChanging ''electric'' dipole fields, as such, are used commercially as near-fields mainly as a source of [[dielectric heating]]. Otherwise, they appear parasitically around conductors which absorb EMR, and around antennas which have the purpose of generating EMR at greater distances.\n\nChanging ''magnetic'' dipole fields (i.e., magnetic near-fields) are used commercially for many types of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] devices. These include motors and electrical transformers at low frequencies, and devices such as [[metal detector]]s and [[MRI]] scanner coils at higher frequencies. Sometimes these high-frequency magnetic fields change at radio frequencies without being far-field waves and thus radio waves; see [[RFID]] tags.\nSee also [[near-field communication]].\nFurther uses of near-field EM effects commercially, may be found in the article on [[virtual photon]]s, since at the quantum level, these fields are represented by these particles. Far-field effects (EMR) in the quantum picture of radiation, are represented by ordinary [[photon]]s.\n\n=== Other ===\n\n* Electromagnetic field can be used to record data on static electricity.\n\n* Old televisions can be traced with Electromagnetic fields.\n\n==Health and safety==\nThe potential health effects of the very low frequency EMFs surrounding power lines and electrical devices are the subject of on-going research and a significant amount of public debate. The US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and other US government agencies do not consider EMFs a proven health hazard. NIOSH has issued some cautionary advisories but stresses that the data are currently too limited to draw good conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-129/ |title=NIOSH Fact Sheet: EMFs in the Workplace |accessdate=31 August 2015|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|date=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health vary widely depending on the frequency and intensity of the fields.

Designed by [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon]] and completed in 1931, the building has a roof height of {{convert|1,250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its [[antenna tower|antenna]]. Its name is derived from \"[[Empire State]]\", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], which is of unknown origin. {{As of|2017}} the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|5th-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]] and the [[List of tallest buildings|28th-tallest in the world]]. It is also the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|6th-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].\n\nThe site of the Empire State Building, located on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th century farm. In the late 1820s, it came into the possession of the prominent [[Astor family]], with [[John Jacob Astor|John Jacob Astor's]] descendants building the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel]] on the site in the 1890s. By the 1920s, the family had sold the outdated hotel and the site indirectly ended up under the ownership of Empire State Inc., a business venture that included businessman [[John J. Raskob]] and former New York governor [[Al Smith]]. The original design of the Empire State Building was for a 50-story office building. However, after fifteen revisions, the final design was for a 86-story 1,250-foot building, with an [[airship]] mast on top. This ensured it would be the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|world's tallest building]], beating the [[Chrysler Building]] and [[40 Wall Street]], two other Manhattan skyscrapers under construction at the time that were also vying for that distinction.\n\nDemolition of the Waldorf\u2013Astoria began in October 1929, and the foundation of the Empire State Building was excavated before demolition was even complete. Construction on the building itself started on March 17, 1930, with an average construction rate of one floor per day. A well-coordinated schedule meant that the 86 stories were [[topping out|topped out]] on September 19, six months after construction started, and the mast was completed by November 21. From that point, interior work proceeded at a quick pace, and it was opened on May 1, 1931, thirteen and a half months after the first steel beam was erected. Despite the publicity surrounding the building's construction, its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s. However, it has been a popular tourist attraction since opening, with around 4 million visitors to the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories every year.\n\nThe Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years until the completion of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] in late 1970. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, it was again the tallest building in New York until the new [[One World Trade Center]] was completed in April 2012.\n\nThe Empire State Building is an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]] and has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].

In this period, eugenic ideas were espoused across the political spectrum. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies with the intent to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both \"positive\" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly \"fit\" to reproduce, and \"negative\" measures such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. People deemed unfit to reproduce often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges of different [[IQ]] tests, criminals and deviants, and members of disfavored minority groups. The eugenics movement became negatively associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]] when many of the [[defendants]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] attempted to justify their human rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States|U.S. eugenics]] programs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |first1=Alison |last1=Bashford |first2=Philippa |last2=Levine |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327&dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials#v=onepage&q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&f=false |page=327|isbn=9780199706532 |date=2010-08-03 }}</ref> In the decades following [[World War II]], with the institution of [[human rights]], many countries gradually began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries, among them the United States and [[Sweden]], continued to carry out forced sterilizations.\n\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, when new [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures became available such as [[gestational surrogacy]] (available since 1985), [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (available since 1989), and [[cytoplasmic transfer]] (first performed in 1996), fear has emerged about a possible revival of eugenics.\n\nA major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether \"negative\" or \"positive\" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of [[genetic diversity]], resulting in [[inbreeding depression]] due to lower genetic variation.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of eugenics}}\n===Origin and development===\n{{Quote box\n |quote = We put down mad dogs; we kill the wild, untamed ox; we use the knife on sick sheep to stop their infecting the flock; we destroy abnormal offspring at birth; children, too, if they are born weak or deformed, we drown.

''The Ethical Principles of Classical Eugenics \u2013 Conclusions'' P. 241 Quote: \"A number of the opponents of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they could lead to further measures that would be unethical. This argument is unpersuasive because all sorts of measures that are acceptable might, if taken to extremes, lead to other measures that are unacceptable.\"</ref> Some fear future \"[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]\" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the [[euthanasia|killing of the institutionalized]] and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.<ref name=\"Black 2003\">{{cite book |last=Black |first=Edwin |author-link=Edwin Black |title=War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race |publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|date=2003 |isbn=1-56858-258-7||ref=harv}}</ref> Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.<ref name=\"Darnovsky Crossroads\">{{cite web |last=Darnovsky |first=Marcy |title=Health and human rights leaders call for an international ban on species-altering procedures |date=2001 |url= http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=2809 |access-date=February 21, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Annas 2002\">{{cite journal |author-link=George Annas |last=Annas |first=George |author2-link=Lori Andrews |last2=Andrews |first2=Lori |author3-link=Rosario Isasi |last3=Isasi |first3=Rosario |title=Protecting the endangered human: Toward an international treaty prohibiting cloning and inheritable alterations |journal=American Journal of Law & Medicine |volume=28 |page=151 |date=2002}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against [[germinal choice technology]] and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to \"improve\" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].<ref name=\"McKibben 2003\">{{cite book |last=McKibben |first=Bill |author-link=Bill McKibben |title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age |publisher=Times Books |date=2003 |isbn=0-8050-7096-6 |oclc=237794777}}</ref>\n\n====Endorsement====\nSome, for example [[Nathaniel C.

In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that \"[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that PGD, and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they're wrong.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Eugenics and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction |first1=Stephen |last1=Wilkinson |first2=Eve |last2=Garrard |publisher=Keele University |orig-year=2013 |url= http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf |access-date=18 September 2013 |isbn=978-0-9576160-0-4}}</ref>\n\nIn their book published in 2000, ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.<ref name=\"Buchanan 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen |last2=Brock |first2=Dan W. |last3=Daniels |first3=Norman |last4=Wikler |first4=Daniel |title=From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-66977-4 |oclc=41211380}}</ref>\n\n[[Original position]], a hypothetical situation developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]], has been used as an argument for ''negative eugenics''.<ref>Shaw, p. 147. Quote: \"What Rawls says is that \"Over time a society is to take steps to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects.\" The key words here are \"preserve\" and \"prevent\". Rawls clearly envisages only the use of negative eugenics as a preventative measure to ensure a good basic level of genetic health for future generations. To jump from this to \"make the later generations as genetically talented as possible,\" as Pence does, is a masterpiece of misinterpretation. This, then, is the sixth argument against positive eugenics: the Veil of Ignorance argument. Those behind the Veil in Rawls' Original Position would agree to permit negative, but not positive eugenics. This is a more complex variant of the Consent argument, as the Veil of Ignorance merely forces us to adopt a position of hypotethical consent to particular principles of justice.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=John R. |date=1991 |title=Beyond Abortion: Human Genetics and the New Eugenics |url= http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&context=plr |journal=Pepperdine Law Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=489\u2013491 |access-date= 2016-06-02 |quote=Rawls arrives at the difference principle by considering how justice might be drawn from a hypothetical \"original position.' A person in the original position operates behind a \"veil of ignorance\" that prevents her from knowing any information about herself such as social status, physical or mental capabilities, or even her belief system. Only from such a position of universal equality can principles of justice be drawn. In establishing how to distribute social primary goods, for example, \"rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth\" and self-respect, Rawls determines that a person operating from the original position would develop two principles. First, liberties ascribed to each individual should be as extensive as possible without infringing upon the liberties of others. Second, social primary goods should be distributed to the greatest advantage of everyone and by mechanisms that allow equal opportunity to all. ... Genetic engineering should not be permitted merely for the enhancement of physical attractiveness because that would not benefit the least advantaged. Arguably, resources should be concentrated on genetic therapy to address disease and genetic defects. However, such a result is not required under Rawls' theory. Genetic enhancement of those already intellectually gifted, for example, might result in even greater benefit to the least advantaged as a result of the gifted individual's improved productivity. Moreover, Rawls asserts that using genetic engineering to prevent the most serious genetic defects is a matter of intergenerational justice. Such actions are necessary in terms of what the present generation owes to later generations.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ableism]]\n* [[Biological determinism]]\n* [[Culling]]\n* [[Directed evolution (transhumanism)]]\n* [[Dor Yeshorim]]\n* [[Eugenics in Mexico]]\n* [[Eugenics in the United States]]\n* [[Genetic determinism]]\n* [[Genetic discrimination]]\n* [[Genetic enhancement]]\n* [[Human enhancement]]\n* [[In vitro fertilisation#Embryo selection|''In vitro'' embryo selection]] ([[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]])\n* [[New eugenics]]\n* [[Life unworthy of life]]\n* [[Mendelian traits in humans]]\n* [[Rare diseases|Prevention of rare diseases]]\n* [[Compulsory sterilization|Sterilization]]\n* [[Social Darwinism]]\n* [[Somatotype and constitutional psychology]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book |last=Anomaly |first=Jonathan |date=2018 |title=Defending Eugenics |publisher=Monash Bioethics Review |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-018-0081-2}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen |date=2017 |title=Better than Human: The Promise and Perils of Deliberate Biomedical Enhancement |publisher=Oxford University Press |url= https://global.oup.com/academic/product/better-than-human-9780190664046?cc=us&lang=en&}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gyngell |first1=Christopher |last2=Selgelid |first2=Michael |date=2016 |title=Twenty-First Century Eugenics |publisher=Oxford University Press |url= http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199981878.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199981878-e-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Larson |first=Edward J. | author-link=Edward J.

Invented by [[Ray Tomlinson]], email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across [[computer network]]s, which today is primarily the [[Internet access|Internet]]. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be [[Online and offline|online]] at the same time, in common with [[instant messaging]]. Today's email systems are based on a [[store-and-forward]] model. Email [[Server (computing)|servers]] accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] or a [[webmail]] interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.\n\nOriginally an [[ASCII]] text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments. [[International email]], with internationalized email addresses using [[UTF-8]], has been standardized, but as of 2017 it has not been widely adopted.<ref name=first/>\n\nThe history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early [[ARPANET]], with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561). An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today. Email had an important role in creating the Internet,<ref>{{Harv|Partridge|2008}}</ref> and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services.\n\n==Terminology==\nHistorically, the term ''electronic mail'' was used generically for any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe [[fax]] document transmission.<ref>Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pages 218\u2013221.</ref><ref>Herbert P.

Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the [[ARPANET]] (created in the late 1960s), which aimed at [[software portability]] between its systems.  That portability helped make the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) increasingly influential.\n\nFor a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the [[X.400]] email system, part of the [[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile]] (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995,<ref>[http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php \"Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101025735/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |date=2016-01-01 }}, Susan R.

The part before the @ sign is the ''local part'' of the address, often the [[username]] of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a [[domain name]]. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the [[fully qualified domain name]] of the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n# The [[DNS server]] for the domain ''b.org'' (''ns.b.org'') responds with any [[MX record]]s listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case ''mx.b.org'', a [[message transfer agent]] (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.<ref>[https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html \"MX Record Explanation\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117204846/https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html |date=2015-01-17 }}, it.cornell.edu</ref>\n# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final [[message delivery agent]] (MDA).\n# The MDA delivers it to the [[Email Mailbox|mailbox]] of user ''bob''.\n# Bob's MUA picks up the message using either the [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP3) or the [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP).\n\nIn addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:\n* Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as [[IBM]] [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]]. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.\n* Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a [[webmail]] service.\n* Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1. \n* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.\n* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.\n\nMany MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called ''[[open mail relay]]s''.

In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a [[signature block]] at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.\n\n===Message header===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Bracket]] -->\nEach message has exactly one [[Header (computing)|header]] (the \"header section\" of the message, according to the specification), which is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]] (\"header fields\"). Each field has a name (\"field name\" or \"header field name\") and a value (\"field body\" or \"header field body\"). RFC 5322 specifies the precise [[syntax]].\n\nInformally, each line of text in the header that begins with a non-[[Whitespace_character|whitespace]] [[Printable characters|printable character]] begins a separate field. The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character \":\". The separator is then followed by the field value (the \"body\" of the field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character. Field names and, without [[Extended SMTP#SMTPUTF8|SMTPUTF8]], field bodies are restricted to 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME [[MIME#Encoded-Word|encoded words]].\n\n====Header fields====\nEmail header fields can be multi-line, with each line recommended to be no more than 78 characters, although the technical limit is 998 characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322|title=RFC 5322, Internet Message Format|author=P.

[[E-mail subject abbreviations|Certain abbreviations]] are commonly used in the subject, including [[E-mail subject abbreviations|\"RE:\" and \"FW:\"]].\n* ''Cc'': [[Carbon copy]]; Many email clients will mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list. (''Bcc'': [[Blind carbon copy]]; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.)\n* [[Content-Type]]: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a [[MIME]] type.\n* ''Precedence'': commonly with values \"bulk\", \"junk\", or \"list\"; used to indicate that automated \"vacation\" or \"out of office\" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. [[Sendmail]] uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with \"Precedence: special-delivery\" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the ''X-Auto-Response-Suppress'' field.<ref>Microsoft, Auto Response Suppress, 2010, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx microsoft reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407033540/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx |date=2011-04-07 }}, 2010 Sep 22</ref>\n* ''Message-ID'': Also an automatically generated field; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).\n* ''In-Reply-To'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies for reply messages.\n* ''References'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.\n* ''Reply-To'': Address that should be used to reply to the message.\n* ''Sender'': Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).\n* ''Archived-At'': A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.\n\nNote that the ''To:'' field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field does not have to be the real sender of the email message. Some mail servers apply [[email authentication]] systems to messages being relayed. Data pertaining to server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.\n\nSMTP defines the ''trace information'' of a message, which is also saved in the header using the following two fields:<ref>{{cite IETF|title=Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|rfc=5321|author=[[John Klensin]]|sectionname=Trace Information|section=4.4| date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n* ''Received'': when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).\n* ''Return-Path'': when the delivery SMTP server makes the ''final delivery'' of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.\n\nOther fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called ''trace fields'', in a broader sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|title=Trace headers|author=John Levine|date=14 January 2012|work=email message|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=16 January 2012|quote=there are many more trace fields than those two|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811135249/http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|archivedate=11 August 2012|df=}}</ref>\n* ''Authentication-Results'': when a server carries out authentication checks, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.<ref>This extensible field is defined by RFC 7001, that also defines an [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] registry of [http://www.iana.org/assignments/email-auth/ Email Authentication Parameters].</ref>\n* ''Received-SPF'': stores results of [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.<ref>RFC 7208.</ref>\n* ''Auto-Submitted'': is used to mark automatically generated messages.<ref>Defined in RFC 3834, and updated by RFC 5436.</ref>\n* ''VBR-Info'': claims [[Vouch by Reference|VBR]] whitelisting<ref>RFC 5518.</ref>\n\n===Message body===\n\n====Content encoding====\nInternet email was originally designed for 7-bit [[ASCII]].<ref>{{cite book|title=TCP/IP Network Administration|year=2002|isbn=978-0-596-00297-8|author=Craig Hunt|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|page=70}}</ref> Most email software is [[8-bit clean]] but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The [[MIME]] standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: [[quoted printable]] for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and [[base64]] for arbitrary binary data. The [[8BITMIME]] and [[BINARY]] extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many [[mail transport agent]]s still do not support them fully. In some countries, several encoding schemes coexist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is coincidence, when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international [[character set]]s, [[Unicode]] is growing in popularity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Plain text and HTML====\nMost modern graphic [[email client]]s allow the use of either [[plain text]] or [[HTML#HTML email|HTML]] for the message body at the option of the user. [[HTML email]] messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well, for compatibility reasons. Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in [[block quote]]s, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as [[underline]]s and [[italics]], and change [[font]] styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about [[web bug]]s, abuse of HTML email as a vector for [[phishing]] attacks and the spread of [[malware|malicious software]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|title=Email policies that prevent viruses|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512053927/http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|archive-date=2007-05-12|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=|df=}}</ref>\n\nSome web-based [[mailing list]]s recommend that all posts be made in plain-text, with 72 or 80 [[characters per line]] for all the above reasons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |title=When posting to a RootsWeb mailing list... |publisher=Helpdesk.rootsweb.com |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219024856/http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |archivedate=2014-02-19 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html |title=...Plain text, 72 characters per line... |publisher=Openbsd.org |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208005706/http://openbsd.org/mail.html |archivedate=2014-02-08 |df= }}</ref> but also because they have a significant number of readers using [[List of email clients#Text-based|text-based email clients]] such as [[Mutt (email client)|Mutt]].

See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nMessages are exchanged between hosts using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] with software programs called [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called [[mail delivery agent]]s (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it,<ref>In practice, some accepted messages may nowadays not be delivered to the recipient's InBox, but instead to a Spam or Junk folder which, especially in a corporate environment, may be inaccessible to the recipient</ref> and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a [[bounce message]] back to the sender, indicating the problem.\n\nUsers can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[IMAP]], or, as is more likely in a large [[corporation|corporate]] environment, with a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] protocol specific to [[Novell Groupwise]], [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]s.  Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called [[mail user agent]]s (MUAs).\n\nMail can be stored on the [[client (computing)|client]], on the [[Server (computing)|server]] side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include [[Maildir]] and [[mbox]]. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as [[IMAP]], moving email from one server to another can be done with any [[Mail user agent|MUA]] supporting the protocol.\n\nMany current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as [[Gmail]] or [[Yahoo! Mail]], that performs the same tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/|title=Free Email Providers in the Yahoo!

Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the ''[[mbox]]'' format. The specific format used is often indicated by special [[filename extension]]s:\n;<tt>eml</tt>\n:Used by many email clients including [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Microsoft Outlook Express]], [[Lotus notes]], [[Windows Mail]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as [[plain text]] in [[MIME]] format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.\n;<tt>emlx</tt>\n:Used by [[Apple Mail]].\n;<tt>msg</tt>\n:Used by [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Office Outlook]] and [[OfficeLogic|OfficeLogic Groupware]].\n;<tt>mbx</tt>\n:Used by [[Opera Mail]], [[KMail]], and [[Apple Mail]] based on the [[mbox]] format.\n\nSome applications (like [[Apple Mail]]) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.\n\n===URI scheme mailto===\n{{main article|mailto}}\nThe [[URI scheme]], as registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], defines the <tt>mailto:</tt> scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the ''To:'' field.<ref>RFC 2368 section 3 : by Paul Hoffman in 1998 discusses operation of the \"mailto\" URL.</ref><ref name=\"Barnett 2011 p. 245\" />\n\n==Types==\n\n===Web-based email===\n{{main article|Webmail}}\nMany email providers have a web-based email client (e.g. [[AOL Mail]], [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]], [[Hotmail]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]]). This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible [[web browser]] to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the client, so can't be read without a current Internet connection.\n\n===POP3 email services===\nThe [[Post Office Protocol]] 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the [[server (computing)|server]]. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).<ref name=\"Windows to Linux\">{{cite book | last = Allen | first = David | title = Windows to Linux | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | location =  | page = 192 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=hMnATfmmA8j00gGMsOC2Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161226051835/https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=hMnATfmmA8j00gGMsOC2Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false | archivedate = 2016-12-26 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n===IMAP email servers===\nThe [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like [[smartphone]]s are increasingly used to check email while travelling, and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server.\n\n===MAPI email servers===\n[[MAPI|Messaging Application Programming Interface]] (MAPI) is used by [[Microsoft Outlook]] to communicate to [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] - and to a range of other email server products such as [[Axigen|Axigen Mail Server]], [[Kerio Connect]], [[Scalix]], [[Zimbra]], [[HP OpenMail]], [[IBM Lotus Notes]], [[Zarafa (software)|Zarafa]], and [[Bynari]] where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Business and organizational use===\nEmail has been widely accepted by business, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an 'e-revolution' in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed [[Internet]]). A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.<ref name=om>By Om Malik, GigaOm. \"[http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ Is Email a Curse or a Boon?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012735/http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ |date=2010-12-04 }}\" September 22, 2010.

Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.\n; Helping with synchronisation\n: With [[Real-time computing|real time]] communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows [[wikt:asynchrony|asynchrony]]: each participant may control their schedule independently.\n; Reducing cost\n: Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or [[long distance telephone call]]s, [[telex]] or [[telegrams]].\n; Increasing speed\n: Much faster than most of the alternatives.\n; Creating a \"written\" record\n: Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.\n\n====Email marketing====\nEmail marketing via \"[[opt-in email|opt-in]]\" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information.<ref name=brett>{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.

While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. {{As of|2011}}, there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.<ref name=\"Barnett 2011 p. 245\">{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Derek |last2=Smith |first2=Marc A. |last3=Heer |first3=Jeffrey |author-link3=Jeffrey Heer |chapter=E-Mail |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false |editor1-last=Barnett |editor1-first=George A |title=Encyclopedia of social networks |publisher=Sage |publication-place=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2011 |isbn=9781412994170 |page=245 |oclc=959670912}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages.

These range from [[List of email scams|various types of email scams]], including [[Social engineering (security)|\"social engineering\"]] scams such as [[advance-fee scam]] \"Nigerian letters\", to [[phishing]], [[email bomb]]ardment and [[Computer worm|email worms]].\n\n===Email spoofing===\n{{Main article|Email spoofing}}\n[[Email spoofing]] occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. [[Email spam]] and [[phishing]] methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\n\n===Email bombing===\n{{main article|Email bomb}}\n\n[[Email bomb]]ing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\n{{Main article|Email privacy}}\n\nToday it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although [[information technology]] personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\n\nEmail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\n* email messages are generally not encrypted.\n* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.\n* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.\n* the \"Received:\"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.\n* [[web bug]]s invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read, or re-read, and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the [[user agent string]].\n\nThere are [[cryptography]] applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, [[Virtual Private Network]]s or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], SMEmail,<ref>[http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3176 SMEmail \u2013 A New Protocol for the Secure E-mail in Mobile Environments], Proceedings of the Australian Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC'08), pp. 39\u201344, Adelaide, Australia, Dec. 2008.</ref> or [[S/MIME]] can be used for [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over [[Transport Layer Security]]/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\n\nAdditionally, many [[mail user agent]]s do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] prevent this. Finally, attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer filesharing]]. Attached files may contain [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or [[Computer virus|viruses]].\n\n===Flaming===\n[[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word \"incendiary\" to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the [[social norms]] that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S. Kiesler |author2=D. Zubrow |author3=A.M. Moses |author4=V. Geller |title=Affect in computer-mediated communication: an experiment in synchronous terminal-to-terminal discussion|journal=Human-Computer Interaction|volume=1|pages=77\u2013104|year=1985|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0101_3}}</ref>\n\n===Email bankruptcy===\n{{main article|Email bankruptcy}}\nAlso known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.<ref>{{cite news|title=All We Are Saying.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html?ref=weekinreview|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24|first=Grant|last=Barrett|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094849/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html?ref=weekinreview|archivedate=April 17, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nOriginally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based.

It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] introduced [[Delivery Status Notification]]s (delivery receipts) and [[Return receipt#Email|Message Disposition Notifications]] (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production. (A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined, but it never gained traction; see RFCs 3885<ref>RFC 3885, ''SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking''</ref> through 3888.<ref>RFC 3888, ''Message Tracking Model and Requirements''</ref>)\n\nMany ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\n* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.\n* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ([[email spoofing]]), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user.\n\nIn the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of [[web bug]]s have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D9143AF931A15752C1A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=Software That Tracks E-Mail Is Raising Privacy Concerns|author=Amy Harmon|publisher=The New York Times|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Email.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102000000/http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |archivedate=2018-01-02 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/yahoo/notification-when-yahoo-email-is-opened.php |title=Webdevelopersnotes.com |publisher=Webdevelopersnotes.com |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109193140/http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/yahoo/notification-when-yahoo-email-is-opened.php |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}</ref> and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML.

Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of \"tone\" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.<ref>{{cite news\n| first      = Alex\n| last       = Williams\n| url        = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/fashion/29emoticon.html\n| title      = (-: Just Between You and Me ;-)\n| work       = [[The New York Times]]\n| date       = July 29, 2007\n| accessdate = March 22, 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n== Origin of the term ==\nThe word is a [[portmanteau]] word of the [[English language|English]] words \"emotion\" and \"icon\".

Emoticons for a smiley face <code>:-)</code> and sad face <code>:-(</code> appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in double-byte languages, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of [[kaomoji]].\n\nThe use of emoticons can be traced back to the 17th century, drawn by a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635,<ref>{{cite web\n| url       = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/smileyoldestslovakia.html\n| title     = 17th-century Emoji\n| last      = Votruba\n| first     = Martin\n| work      = Slovak Studies Program\n| publisher = University of Pittsburgh\n}}</ref> but they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing.

The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to \"Royal Portable\", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h \"raising its hand\".<ref>MAD Magazine No. 73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pp. 36-37</ref> Two additional \"Typewri-toons\" articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.\n\nIn 1963, the \"[[smiley]] face\", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist [[Harvey Ball]]. It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is, in fact, a small yellow smiley face.\n\nIn a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in April 1969, [[Alden Whitman]] asked writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]]: \"How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?\" Nabokov answered: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&nbsp;\u2013 some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| author     = Nabokov\n| title      = Strong Opinions\n| isbn       = 0-679-72609-8\n| publisher  = Vintage Books\n| date       = March 1990\n| url        = http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter11.txt\n| accessdate = March 24, 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, a French journalist, [[Franklin Loufrani]], created a smiley logo to mark good news in the French newspaper ''France Soir''.

The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to the widespread use of smiley face designs. Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was \"readily distinguishable\" from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court.

The two character version <code>:)</code> which omits the nose is also very popular.\n\n=== Common Western examples ===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Less than three]] -->\n{{Main|List of emoticons}}The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny [[ambigrams]]), with or without a hyphen (nose).\nThere are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, <code>:(</code> equals sad and <code>:((</code> equals very sad. Weeping can be written as <code>:'(</code>. A blush can be expressed as <code>:\"></code>. Others include wink <code>;)</code>, a grin <code>:D</code>, smug <code>:-></code>, and tongue out <code>:P</code>, such as when [[blowing a raspberry]]. An often used combination is also <code><3</code> for a heart, and <code></3</code> for a broken heart. <code>:O</code> is also sometimes used to depict shock.\n\nA broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; <code>XD</code> and the addition of further \"D\" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. <code>XDDDD</code>. There are hundreds of other variations including <code>>:(</code> for anger, or <code>>:D</code> for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of <code>D:<</code>. <code>=K</code> for vampire teeth, <code>:s</code> for grimace, and <code>;P</code> can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a [[double entendre|second meaning]] in the sentence preceding it.<ref>Dresner & Herring (2010).</ref>\n\nAs computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The '[[shrug]]' emoticon, <code>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</code>, uses the glyph [[\u30c4]] from the Japanese [[katakana]] writing system.\n\n=== Variation ===\n{{Main|ASCII art}}\n\nAn equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as <code>=)</code>, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an \"o\" as in <code>=O)</code> . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://sourceforge.net/projects/denoser/\n| title      = Denoser strips noses from text\n| publisher  = Sourceforge.net\n| accessdate = March 14, 2013\n}}</ref> but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon <code>:-)</code> or <code>:^)</code>. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age.{{how|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{cite journal\n| url         = http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol18/iss2/14/\n| title       = Do You Smile with Your Nose?

It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as <code>]</code> instead of <code>)</code>.\n\nSome variants are also more common in certain countries due to [[keyboard layout]]s. For example, the smiley <code>=)</code> may occur in [[Scandinavia]], where the keys for <code>=</code> and <code>)</code> are placed right beside each other. However, the <code>:)</code> variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the <code>=)</code> version a rarity. [[Diacritic]]al marks are sometimes used. The letters <code>\u00d6</code> and <code>\u00dc</code> can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of <code>:O</code> (meaning that one is surprised) and <code>:D</code> (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.\n\nSome emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example <code>D:</code> which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of <code>:D</code>.\n\n== {{Anchor|East Asian style|Asian style}}Japanese style (\"Kaomojis\") ==\n[[File:It's all about the smilies (3578588882).jpg|thumb|200px|Kaomojis on a Japanese NTT Docomo mobile phone]]\n[[File:Kaomoji! (2334722446).jpg|thumb|200px|A Kaomoji painting in Japan]]\nUsers from [[Japan]] popularized a style of emoticons ([[:ja:\u9854\u6587\u5b57|\u9854\u6587\u5b57]], ''kaomoji, lit.'' \"face characters\") that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on [[ASCII Corporation#History|ASCII NET]], an early Japanese online service, in 1986.<ref name=\"aist\" /><ref name=\"whatjapanthinks2007\" /> Similar-looking emoticons were used on the [[Byte Information Exchange]] (BIX) around the same time.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg261.txt\n| title      = Jargon file, version 2.6.1, February 12, 1991\n| accessdate = March 14, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThese emoticons are usually found in a format similar to <code>(*_*)</code>. The [[asterisk]]s indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an [[underscore]], the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.\n\nDifferent emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, \"T\" can be used to express crying or sadness: <code>(T_T)</code>. <code>T_T</code> may also be used to mean \"unimpressed\".  The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. <code>^^</code>.  Looks of stress are represented by the likes of <code>(x_x)</code>, while <code>(-_-;)</code> is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced [[sweat drop]] (discussed further below).  <code>///</code> can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = KawaiiFace.net\n| url        = http://kawaiiface.net\n| accessdate = March 21, 2014\n| year       = 2014\n}}</ref> Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, \"cuter\" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. <code>(^.^)</code>. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. <code>(^^)</code>.\n\nParentheses are sometimes replaced with [[Bracket#Curly brackets|braces]] or [[Bracket#Square brackets|square brackets]], e.g. <code>{^_^}</code> or <code>[o_0]</code>. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. <code>^^</code>,<code> >.< </code>, <code>o_O</code>, <code>O.O</code>, <code>e_e</code>, or <code>e.e</code>. A quotation mark <code>\"</code>, apostrophe <code>'</code>, or semicolon <code>;</code> can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in [[manga]] and [[anime]].\n\nMicrosoft [[Input method editor|IME]] 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.  In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary.  Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.\n\nCommunication software allowing the use of [[Shift JIS]] encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as <code>(^\u30e0^)</code> or <code>(\u76ca)</code>.\n\nModern communication software generally utilizes [[Unicode]], which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in <code>(`\u0414\u00b4)</code> or <code>(\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f)</code>.\n\nFurther variations can be produced using Unicode [[combining character]]s, as in <code>\u0669(\u0361\u0e4f\u032f\u0361\u0e4f)\u06f6</code> or <code> \u1d98\u1d52\u1d25\u1d52\u1d85</code>.\n\n=== Western use of Japanese style ===\nEnglish-language [[anime]] forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.  Because of this, they are often called \"anime style\" emoticons in English{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums.  Emoticons such as <code><(&nbsp;^.^&nbsp;)></code>, <code><(^_^<)</code>, <code><(o_o<)</code>, <code><(&nbsp;-'.'-&nbsp;)></code>, <code><('.'-^)</code>, or <code>(>';..;')></code> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as \"{{not a typo|Kirbys}}\" in reference to their likeness to [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]] character [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]].  The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an [[intensifier]] for the emoticon in question, e.g. <code>^_________^</code> for very happy. The emoticon {{nowrap|<code>t(-_-t)</code>}} uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western [[The finger|\"middle-finger flick-off\"]] using a \"t\" as the arm, hand, and finger. Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like <code>*,..,*</code> or <code>`;..;\u00b4</code> to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.\n\n=== Mixture of Western and Japanese style ===\nExposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture has given rise to many emoticons that have an upright viewing format.  The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as <code>-O-</code>, <code>-3-</code>, <code>-w-</code>, <code>'_'</code>, <code>;_;</code>, <code>T_T</code>, <code>:></code>, and <code>.V.</code> are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example <code>^_^'</code>, <code>!>_<!</code>, <code><@>_____<@>;;</code>, <code>;O;</code>, and <code>*u*</code>.  The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example <code>=0=</code>, <code>=3=</code>, <code>=w=</code>, <code>=A=</code>, and <code>=7=</code>.\n\nIn Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in <code>\u00f2_\u00f3</code>, <code>\u00f3_\u00f2</code>, <code>\u00f5_o</code>, <code>\u00f9_u</code>, or <code>o_\u00d4</code>.\n\n=== 2channel style ===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[\u0ca0 \u0ca0]] -->\nUsers of the Japanese discussion board [[2channel]], in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], as in  <code>\u0ca0_\u0ca0</code> (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).  These were quickly picked up by [[4chan]] and spread to other Western sites soon after.  Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like [[Mona (ASCII art)|Mon\u0101]].\n\n== Korean style ==\nIn [[South Korea]], emoticons use Korean [[Hangul]] letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean [[jamo]] (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos <code>\u3145</code>, <code>\u3141</code> or <code>\u3142</code> as the mouth/nose component and <code>\u3147</code>, <code>\u314e</code> or <code>\u314d</code> for the eyes. For example: <code>\u3147\u3145\u3147</code>, <code>\u3147\u3142\u3147</code>, <code>\u3147\u3141\u3147</code> and <code>-\u3145-</code>. Faces such as <code>'\u3145'</code>, <code>\"\u3145\"</code>, <code>'\u3142'</code> and <code>'\u3147'</code>, using quotation marks <code>\"</code> and apostrophes <code>'</code> are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as \u315c,\u3160 depict a crying face. Example: <code>\u315c\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160\u3160</code> and <code>\ub274\ub274</code> (same function as T in western style). Sometimes \u3161 (not an em-dash \"\u2014\" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in <code>\u315c.\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160.\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160.\u3161</code>, <code>\u315c_\u3160</code>, <code>\u3161^\u315c</code> and <code>\u315c\u3147\u3161</code>. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with \u3161 or \u2013 they depict a bad feeling. Examples: <code>-;/</code>, <code>--^</code>, <code>\u3161\u3161;;;</code>, <code>-_-;;</code> and <code>-_^</code>. However, <code>^^, ^\uc624^</code> means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: <code>~_~</code>, <code>--a</code>, <code>-6-</code>, <code>+0+</code>.\n\n== Chinese ideographic style ==\n{{See also|Jiong}}\n\nThe character \u56e7 (U+56E7), which means \"bright\",<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://baike.baidu.com/view/181979.htm\n| title      = Baidu: \u56e7\n| publisher  = Baike.baidu.com\n| accessdate = March 14, 2013\n}}</ref> is also used in the Chinese computing community for a frowning face.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://tv.people.com.cn/BIG5/61602/7815716.html\n| title       = \u751f\u50fb\u5b57\u5927\u884c\u5176\u9053 \"\u56e7\"\u884d\u751f\u51fa\u5404\u7a2e\u8868\u60c5\n| work        = People's Daily\n| accessdate  = March 14, 2013\n| deadurl     = yes\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007082939/http://tv.people.com.cn/BIG5/61602/7815716.html\n| archivedate = October 7, 2011\n}}</ref> It is also combined with posture emoticon Orz, such as \u56e7rz.

These videos lack of a popular name yet and there are several ways to designate them: \"emoticlips\" (named above), \"emotivideos\" or more recently \"emoticon videos\". These are tiny little videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone to another or many other devices. The current video compression codecs (like [[H.264]]) allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of KB and very portable. The popular computer and mobile app Skype\u2122 uses these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the \"emoticon videos\" in parenthesis.\n\n== Emoticons and intellectual property rights ==\n[[File:USpatent6987991 emoticon.jpg|thumb|Patented drop down menu for composing phone mail text message with emoticons. {{cite patent|US|6987991}}]]\n\nIn 2000, [[Despair, Inc.]] obtained a U.S. [[trademark]] registration for the \"frowny\" emoticon <code>:-(</code> when used on \"greeting cards, posters and art prints\".

''Investigaciones Economicas'' 25, no. 3 (2001):585-602.</ref>  Additionally, education is often the tool with which societies instill a common set of values that underlie the basic norms of the society. Furthermore, there are positive externalities to society from education. These positive externalities can be in the form of reduced crime, more informed citizens and economic development, known as the neighborhood effect.<ref>McMahon, Walter. \"Externalities in Education.\" ''Bureau of Economic and Business Research'' Working Paper, no. 877 (1982):1-7.</ref>\n\nIn terms of economic theory, families face a bundle of consumption choices that determine how much they will spend on education and private consumption. Any number of consumption bundles are available as long as they fit within the  budget constraint. Meaning that any bundle of consumption of education and private consumption must not exceed budgetary constraints. Indifference curves represent the preferences of one good over another. The indifference curve determines how much education an individual will want to consume versus how much private consumption an individual will want to consume.<ref name=\"Gruber, Jonathan 2015\">Gruber, Jonathan.''Public Finance and Public Policy, 5th edition''.

A family can choose to where their child goes to school and pick the school that is closest to their preference of education provider.\n\nThe second reason is vouchers are proposed to increase market competition amongst schools. Similar to the free market theorem, vouchers hope to make schools more competitive while lowering costs for schools and increasing the educational quality for consumers, the families.\n\nIn many instances where school voucher programs have been instituted, there have been mixed results, with some programs showing increased benefits of school vouchers and some instances showing detrimental effects.\n\n===Positive and negative effects of school vouchers===\n\n====Positive effects====\n\nIn the United States, vouchers are usually funded with state dollars, and in other countries, through a variety of government funding vehicles. It is important to note that schools in the United States retain their federal and local funding regardless of enrollment- only state funding is dependent on enrollment size.<ref name=\"edchoice.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.edchoice.org/blog/how-to-accurately-calculate-the-fiscal-impact-of-school-voucher-programs/|last=Leuken|first=Martin|title=How to Accurately Calculate the Fiscal Impact of School Voucher Programs|publisher=''EdChoice''|date=September 27, 2016}}</ref> Part of improving student performance involves improving teacher and school performance. In theory, more school vouchers would prompt the formation of more private schools which will give parents more choice in school. This increased competition would make both the private and public schools, who are both competing for the voucher funds, maintain a high-quality of teaching as well as keeping costs low. \nIndeed, there is evidence that school vouchers result in cost savings for school systems. A fiscal analysis of Indiana\u2019s school voucher system showed annual savings, per student, for the state government.<ref name=\"edchoice.org\"/>\n\nProponents of voucher schools argue that there is evidence of multiple benefits for students and families because of school vouchers. There is evidence to show that the use of school vouchers results in increased test scores and higher high school graduation rates for students.

It aimed to assist low-income households by distributing school vouchers to students living in neighborhoods situated in the two lowest socioeconomic strata. Between 1991 and 1997, the PACES program awarded 125,000 vouchers to lower-income [[secondary school]] students. Those vouchers were worth about US $190 in 1998, and data shows that matriculation fees and other monthly expenses incurred by voucher students attending [[Private school|private schools]] averaged about US $340 in 1998, so a majority of voucher recipients supplemented the voucher with personal funds.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last=Angrist |first=Joshua |last2=Bettinger |first2=Eric |last3=Kremer |first3=Michael |title=Long-Term Consequences of Secondary School Vouchers: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2006 |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=847\u2013862 |doi=10.1257/aer.96.3.847 }}</ref>\n[[File:School Voucher Diagram.svg|thumb|Basic School Voucher Utility Maximization Picture]]\nThe students selected to be in the program were selected by lottery.

As a result, over 1,000 private schools entered the market, and private enrollment increased by 20-40% by 1998, surpassing 50% in some urban areas.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Chang-Tai |last2=Urquiola |first2=Miguel |title=The effects of generalized school choice on achievement and stratification: Evidence from Chile's voucher program |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=90 |issue=8\u20139 |year=2006 |pages=1477\u20131503 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.11.002 }}</ref> From 1981 to 1988, the private school enrollment rate in urban areas grew 11% more than the private school enrollment rate in rural areas.<ref name=\":3\" /> This change coincided with the transfer of public school administration from the [[central government]] to local municipalities. The financial value of a voucher didn\u2019t depend on the income of the family receiving it, and the program allowed private voucher schools to be selective, while [[State school|public schools]] had to accept and enroll every interested student. At the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, student achievement in Chile was low compared to students in other nations based on international test-scores. This disparity led to the Chilean government enacting substantial educational reforms in 2008, including major changes in the school voucher system.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Murnane |first=Richard J. |last2=Waldman |first2=Marcus R. |last3=Willett |first3=John B. |last4=Bos |first4=Maria Soledad |last5=Vegas |first5=Emiliana |date=June 2017 |title=The Consequences of Educational Voucher Reform in Chile |work=NBER Working Paper No. 23550 |doi=10.3386/w23550 }}</ref>\n\nThe Chilean government passed the Preferential School Subsidy Law (SEP) in January of 2008. This piece of legislation made the educational voucher system much more like the regulated compensatory model championed by [[Christopher Jencks]]. Under SEP, the voucher system was altered to take family incomes into account. The vouchers provided to \u201cpriority students,\u201d students whose family income was in the bottom 40% of Chileans in were worth 50% more than those given to the families of students in the upper 60%.<ref name=\":1\" /> Schools with larger numbers of priority students were eligible to receive per-student bonuses, the size of which was tied to the percentage of priority students in the student body. When SEP was started, it covered preschool to fourth grade, and an additional school-year of coverage was added each subsequent year. Almost every public school chose to participate in SEP in 2008, as well as almost two-thirds of private subsidized elementary schools.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere were three important requirements attached to the program. The first requirement stipulated that participating schools could not charge fees to priority students, although private schools in the voucher system could do so for non-priority students. The second requirement ensured that schools could not select students based on their academic ability, not expel them on academic grounds. The third requirement postulated that schools had to self-enroll themselves in an accountability system that ensured that schools were responsible for the utilization of financial resources and student test scores.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Europe===\nIn most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g. Belgium or France), parents are free to choose which school their child attends.\n\n====Ireland====\n{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}\nMost schools in Ireland are state-aided parish schools, established under diocesan patronage but with capital costs, teachers salaries and a per head fee paid to the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?maincat=&pcategory=17216&ecategory=20658&sectionpage=12251&language=EN&link=link001&page=1&doc=18626 |title=Irish Government Department of Education website |publisher=Education.ie |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> These are given to the school regardless of whether or not it requires its students to pay fees. (Although fee-paying schools are in the minority, there has been much criticism over the state aid they receive with opponents claiming this gives them an unfair advantage.)\n\nThere is a recent trend towards multi-denominational schools established by parents, which are organised as limited companies without share capital. Parents and students are free to choose their own school. In the event of a school failing to attract students it immediately loses its per-head fee and over time loses its teaching posts \u2013 and teachers are moved to other schools which are attracting students. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/44/38574871.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Irish report 02_04_07.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 1995\u20137 Rainbow Coalition (which contained parties of the centre right and the left) introduced free third-level education to primary degree level. Critics of the latter development charge that it has not increased the number of students from economically deprived backgrounds attending university. However, studies have shown that the removal of tuition fees at third level has increased the number of students overall and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This concurs with evidence from the UK of a decrease in attendance numbers after the introduction of fees. However, since the economic crisis, there has been extensive talk and debate regarding the reintroduction of third-level fees.\n\n====Sweden====\n{{Further information|Education in Sweden}}\nIn [[Sweden]], a system of school vouchers (called ''skolpeng'') was introduced in 1992 at primary and secondary school level, enabling free choice among publicly run schools and privately run ''friskolor'' (\"free schools\"). The voucher is paid with public funds from the local [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] (''kommun'') directly to a school based solely on its number of students. Both public schools and free schools are funded the same way. Free schools can be run by not-for-profit groups as well as by for-profit companies, but may not charge top-up fees or select students other than on a first-come, first-served basis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Choice Revolution: Privatization of Swedish Welfare Services in the 1990s |first=Paula|last=Blomqvist |journal=Social Policy & Administration |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013155 |date=April 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9515.2004.00382.x}}</ref> Over 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled in free schools in 2008 and the number is growing fast, leading the country to be viewed as a pioneer of the model.<ref name=\"swedishmodeleconomist\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11535645|title=Making money from schools: The Swedish model|publisher=The Economist | date=June 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Spectator|year=2008|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/526631/made-in-sweden-the-new-tory-education-revolution.thtml|title=Made in Sweden: the new Tory education revolution|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627082940/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/526631/made-in-sweden-the-new-tory-education-revolution.thtml|archivedate=June 27, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3717744.stm|title=Swedish parents enjoy school choice | location=London | date=October 5, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Mike | last=Baker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Washington Times|year=2008|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/11/embracing-private-schools/|title=Embracing private schools: Sweden lets companies use taxes for cost-efficient alternatives}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435386/How-choice-has-transformed-education-in-Sweden.html|title=How choice has transformed education in Sweden | location=London | first=Johnny | last=Munkhammar | date=May 25, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Per Unckel]], governor of Stockholm and former Minister of Education, has promoted the system, saying \"Education is so important that you can\u2019t just leave it to one producer, because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes.\" The Swedish system has been recommended to [[Barack Obama]] by some commentators,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/03/15/opinion/1194838660912/sweden-s-choice.html|title=Sweden\u2019s Choice: Why the Obama Administration Should Look to Europe for a School Voucher Program that Works|author=Lance T.

Each child will get HK$13,000 per year. The $13,000 subsidy will be separated into two parts. $10,000 is used to subsidize the school fee and the remaining $3,000 is used for kindergarten teachers to pursue further education and obtain a certificate in Education. Also, there are some restrictions on the voucher system. Parents can only choose non-profit schools with a yearly fee less than $24,000. The government hoped that all kindergarten teachers can obtain an Education certificate by the year 2011\u201312, at which point the subsidies are to be adjusted to $16,000 for each student, all of which will go toward the school fee.\n\n[[Milton Friedman]] criticised the system, saying \"I do not believe that [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|CE]] Mr. Tsang's proposal is properly structured.\" He said that the whole point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive market place so should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens. <!--source: ming pao news\n2006 11 13-->\n\nAfter protests by parents with children enrolled in for profit kindergartens, the program was extended to children in for- profit kindergartens, but only for children enrolled in or before September 2007. The government will also provide up to HK$30,000 subsidy to for profit kindergartens wanting to convert to non profit.\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn Pakistani Punjab, the Education Voucher Scheme (EVS) was introduced by Dr. Allah Bakhsh Malik Managing Director and Chief Executive of Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), especially in urban slums and poorest of the poor in 2005. The initial study was sponsored by Open Society Institute New York USA. Professor Henry M. Levin extended Pro-Bono services for children of poor families from Punjab. To ensure educational justice and integration, the government must ensure that the poorest families have equal access to quality education. The voucher scheme was designed by the Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Open Society Institute. It aims to promote freedom of choice, efficiency, equity, and social cohesion.\n\nA pilot project was started in 2006 in the urban slums of Sukhnehar, Lahore, where a survey showed that all households lived below the poverty line. Through the EVS, the foundation would deliver education vouchers to every household with children 5\u201313 years of age. The vouchers would be redeemable against tuition payments at participating private schools. In the pilot stage, 1,053 households were given an opportunity to send their children to a private school of their choice. The EVS makes its partner schools accountable to the parents rather than to the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education. In the FAS program, every school principal has the choice to admit a student or not. However, in the EVS, a school cannot refuse a student if the student has a voucher and the family has chosen that school. The partner schools are also accountable to the PEF: they are subject to periodic reviews of their student learning outcomes, additional private investments, and improvements in working conditions of the teachers. The EVS provides an incentive to parents to send their children to school, and so it has become a source of competition among private schools seeking to join the program.\n\nWhen it comes to the selection of schools, the following criteria are applied across the board: (i) The fee paid by the PEF to EVS partner schools is PKR 300 per child per month. Schools charging higher fees can also apply to the program, but they will not be paid more than PKR 450, and they will not be entitled to charge the difference to students\u2019 families. (ii) Total school enrollment should be between 100 and 500 children.  (iii) The school should have an adequate infrastructure and a good learning environment. (iv) EVS partner schools should be located within a half-kilometer radius of the residences of voucher holders. However, if the parents prefer a particular school farther away, the PEF will not object, provided that the school fulfills the EVS selection criteria. (v) The PEF advertises to stimulate the interest of potential partner schools. It then gives students at short-listed schools preliminary tests in selected subjects, and conducts physical inspections of these schools. PEF offices display a list of all the EVS partner schools so that parents may consult it and choose a school for their children.\n\nBy now more than 140, 000 students are benefiting from EVS and the program is being scaled up by financing from Government of Punjab.\n\n==School voucher public policy in the United States==\n\nIn the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in the initial education-reform proposals leading up to the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. As of December 2016, 14 states had traditional school voucher programs. <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/interactive-guide-to-school-choice.aspx#/|title=Interactive Guide to School Choice Laws|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref> These states consist of: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

Most of these programs were offered to students in low-income families, low performing schools, or students with disabilities. By 2014, the number participating in either vouchers or tax-credit scholarships increased to 250,000, a 30% increase from 2010, but still a small fraction compared to the 55 million in traditional schools.<ref name=politico>{{cite news|last1=Stephanie|first1=Simon|title=Special report: Taxpayers fund creationism in the classroom|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/education-creationism-104934.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=2014-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]'s [[Milwaukee Public Schools|public schools]] were the first to offer vouchers and has nearly 15,000 students using vouchers as of 2011.

Thus, proponents argue that a voucher system increases school performance and accountability<ref>https://mises.org/media/2349/Roads-Education-and-Waterways-The-Case-Against-Public-Services</ref> because it provides [[consumer sovereignty]] \u2013 allowing individuals to choose what product to buy, as opposed to a [[Public administration|bureaucracy]].<ref>http://ingrimayne.com/econ/AllocatingRationing/DollarVoting.html</ref><ref>http://ingrimayne.com/econ/government/MajorityRule.html</ref>\n\nThis argument is supported by studies such as \"When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement\" ([[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], 2003), which concluded that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements than did similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Stanford's [[Caroline Hoxby]], who has researched the systemic effects of school choice, determined that areas with greater residential school choice have consistently higher test scores at a lower per-pupil cost than areas with very few school districts.<ref name=\"hoxby1998\"/> Hoxby studied the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools. Public schools forced to compete made greater test-score gains than schools not faced with such competition,<ref name=\"hoxby2001\"/> and that the so-called effect of [[cream skimming]] did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined. Hoxby's research has found that both private and public schools improved through the use of vouchers.<ref name=\"hoxby1998\">Hoxby, Caroline \"Analyzing School Choice Reforms that Use America's Traditional Forms of Parental Choice\" in Paul E.

The [[Foundation for Educational Choice]] alleges that a school voucher plan \"embodies exactly the same principle as the GI bills that provide for educational benefits to military veterans.

Friedman, The role of government in education, 1955), it would now be entirely practicable to defray the costs of general education out of the public purse without maintaining government schools, by giving the parents vouchers covering the cost of education of each child which they could hand over to schools of their choice. It may still be desirable that government directly provide schools in a few isolated communities where the number of children is too small (and the average cost of education therefore too high) for privately run schools. But with respect to the great majority of the population, it would undoubtedly be possible to leave the organization and management of education entirely to private efforts, with the government providing merely the basic finance and ensuring a minimum standard for all schools where the vouchers could be spent.

I'm one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.\n\nI have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers \u2013 so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.\n\nIf we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, \"Let's start a school.\"\n|sign=[[Steve Jobs]]<ref>https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html</ref>}}\n\nAs a practical matter, proponents note, most U.S. programs only offer poor families the same choice more affluent families already have, by providing them with the means to leave a failing school and attend one where the child can get an education. Because public schools are funded on a per-pupil basis, the money simply follows the child, but the cost to taxpayers is less because the voucher generally is less than the actual cost.\n\nIn addition, they say, the comparisons of public and private schools on average are meaningless. Vouchers usually are utilized by children in failing schools, so they can hardly be worse off even if the parents fail to choose a better school. Also, focusing on the effect on the public school suggests that is more important than the education of children.\n\nSome proponents of school vouchers, including the Sutherland Institute and many supporters of the Utah voucher effort, see it as a remedy for the negative cultural impact caused by under-performing public schools, which falls disproportionately on demographic minorities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During the run-up to the November referendum election, Sutherland issued a controversial publication:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/vouchersvows.pdf |title=Sutherland Institute &#124; Vouchers Vows & Vexations |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Voucher, Vows, & Vexations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695210997,00.html |title=Deseret Morning News &#124; Voucher foe in 'lion's den'? |publisher=Deseretnews.com |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Sutherland called the publication an important review of the history of education in Utah, while critics just called it revisionist history.<ref>[http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/news/news_details.asp?c=1&id=274 The Sutherland Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217202856/http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/news/news_details.asp?c=1&id=274 |date=December 17, 2007 }}</ref>  Sutherland then released a companion article in a law journal<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |title=Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5noKmGSvh?url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as part of an academic conference about school choice.<ref>[http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008_2.htm Law School Conference on School Choice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155328/http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008_2.htm |date=July 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[EdChoice]], founded by Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996, is a non-profit organization that promotes universal school vouchers and other forms of school choice. In defense of vouchers, it cites empirical research showing that students who were randomly assigned to receive vouchers had higher academic outcomes than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them; and that vouchers improve academic outcomes at public schools, reduce racial segregation, deliver better services to special education students, and do not drain money from public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=255 |title=Forster, Greg.

Since almost all students and their families would like to choose the best schools, those schools, as a result, quickly reach its maximum capacity number for students that state law permits. Those who did not get vouchers then have to compete again to look for some other less preferred and competitive schools or give up searching and go back to their assigned local schools.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pons|first=Michael|title=School Vouchers: The Emerging Track Record|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16970.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref> [[Jonathan Kozol]], a prominent public school reform thinker and former public school teacher called vouchers the \"single worst, most dangerous idea to have entered education discourse in my adult life\".<ref>Lisa Kaiser, \"[http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-5728-an-interview-with-educator-and-activist-jonathan-kozol.html An Interview with Educator and Activist Jonathan Kozol]\", March 4, 2009, Express Milwaukee.com</ref>\n\nThe [[National Education Association]] additionally argues that more money should go towards the [[Public Education]] to help the schools struggling and improve the schools overall, instead of reducing the public school\u2019s fund to go towards school vouchers.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/19133.htm|title=The Case Against Vouchers|work=NEA|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}</ref> Their argument claims that increasing that amount of money that goes towards public education would also increase the amount of resources put into public schools, therefore, improving the education.<ref name=\":7\" /> This argument made towards school vouchers reflect the way the organization values public education.

One of these studies, conducted by the [[Tulane University]]\u2019s Education Research Alliance, consists of observing the relationship between voucher programs and student\u2019s test scores. They found that students in the Louisiana voucher program initially had lower test scores, but after three years, their scores matched those of students who stayed in public schools from standardized test scores spanning from 2012 to 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4832923/betsy-devos-trump-administration-school-choice-vouchers/|title=Here's Why Researchers Say Betsy DeVos' Proposed School Voucher Program Won't Work|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>\n\nPeople who can benefit from vouchers may not know it. In April 2012, a bill passed in Louisiana that made vouchers available to low-income families whose children attended poorly ranked schools.

They argue that some, if not all, of the cost difference between public and private schools comes from \"[[cream skimming]]\", whereby the private schools select only those students who belong to a preferred group \u2013 whether economic, religious, educational aptitude level, or ethnicity \u2013 rather than from differences in administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-025.html |title=What Would A School Voucher Buy The Real Cost Of Private Schools |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/b/2007/10/28/are-private-schools-more-cost-effective-than-public-ones.htm |title=Are Private Schools More Cost Effective Than Public Ones? |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>  The end result, it has been argued, is that a voucher system has led or would lead students who do not belong to the private schools' preferred groupings to become concentrated at public schools.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Gifted Children Left Behind |author=Susan Goodkin and David G.

In the United States, as of 2016, there are currently no state laws that require voucher programs to not discriminate against marginalized communities.<ref>Suzanne E. Eckes, Julie Mead & Jessica Ulm (2016) Dollars to Discriminate: The (Un)intended Consequences of School Vouchers, Peabody Journal of Education, 91:4, 537-558, DOI: 10.1080/0161956X.2016.1207446</ref>  Further, while some voucher programs may explicitly be aimed at marginalized communities, this is not necessarily always the case. A common argument for school vouchers is that it allows for marginalized communities of color to be uplifted from poverty. Historically, however, data suggests that voucher programs have been used to further segregate Americans.<ref>Mark A. Gooden, Huriya Jabbar & Mario S. Torres, Jr. (2016) Race and School Vouchers: Legal, Historical, and Political Contexts, Peabody Journal of Education, 91:4, 522-536, DOI: 10.1080/0161956X.2016.1207445</ref> Further, some data has shown that the effects of voucher programs such as the New York City School Choice Scholarship Program, are marginal when it comes to increasing student achievement.<ref>Marianne Bitler, Thurston Domina, Emily Penner & Hilary Hoynes (2015) Distributional Analysis in Educational Evaluation: A Case Study from the New York City Voucher Program, Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness, 8:3, 419-450, DOI: 10.1080/19345747.2014.921259</ref>\n\nAnother argument against a school voucher system is its lack of accountability to taxpayers. In many states, members of a community's board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. By contrast, although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers cannot vote on budget issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings. [[Kevin G. Welner|Kevin Welner]] points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit system\u2014a policy he calls \"neovouchers\"\u2014present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit.<ref>See Welner, Kevin G.

In 2012,  Louisiana State Superintendent of Education John White selected private schools to receive vouchers, then tried to fabricate criteria (including site visits) after schools had already received approval letters.

White published his first article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1925, then joined the staff in 1927 and continued to contribute for almost six decades. Best recognized for his essays and unsigned \"Notes and Comment\" pieces, he gradually became the magazine's most important contributor, this at a time when it was arguably the most important literary magazine in America. From the beginning to the end of his career at ''The New Yorker,'' he frequently provided what the magazine calls \"Newsbreaks\" (short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources) under various categories such as \"Block That Metaphor.\" He also served as a columnist for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' from 1938 to 1943.\n\nIn 1949, White published ''Here Is New York'', a short book based on an article he had been commissioned to write for ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]''. Editor [[Ted Patrick (editor)|Ted Patrick]] approached White about writing the essay telling him it would be fun. \"Writing is never 'fun,' replied White.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/05/holiday-magazine-history|title=The Visual and Writerly Genius of Holiday Magazine|last=Callahan|first=Michael|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}</ref> That article reflects the writer's appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both \"the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy.\" It concludes with a dark note touching on the forces that could destroy the city that he loved. This prescient \"love letter\" to the city was re-published in 1999 on his centennial with an introduction by his stepson, [[Roger Angell]].\n\nIn 1959, White edited and updated ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of [[American English]] was first written and published in 1918 by [[William Strunk Jr.]], one of White's professors at Cornell. White's reworking of the book was extremely well received, and later editions followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. [[Maira Kalman]] illustrated an edition in 2005. That same year, a New York composer named [[Nico Muhly]] premiered a short opera based on the book.

His first children's book, ''[[Stuart Little]]'', was published in 1945, and ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' appeared in 1952. ''[[Stuart Little]]'' initially received a lukewarm welcome from the literary community. However, both books went on to receive high acclaim, and ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' won the [[Newbery Medal]] from the [[American Library Association]].\n\nWhite received the [[Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal]] from the U.S. professional children's librarians in 1970.

In some denominations of the movement, an evangelist is referred to as a '''[[patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarch]]'''. However, the latter term was deprecated by the [[Community of Christ]] after the church began ordaining women to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]]. Other denominations, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], have an evangelist position independent of the original \"patriarch\" office instituted movement founder [[Joseph Smith]].\n\n==Early Latter Day Saint movement==\nThe first use of the term \"evangelist\" in Latter Day Saint theology were mainly consistent with how the term is used by [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].\n\nIn 1833, Joseph Smith introduced the new office of [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|Patriarch]], to which he ordained [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|his father]]. The elder Smith was given the \"keys of the [[Patriarchal priesthood|patriarchal Priesthood]] over the kingdom of God on earth\", the same power said to be held by the [[Patriarch (Bible)|Biblical Patriarchs]], which included the power to give blessings upon one's posterity.<ref>[[Joseph Fielding Smith]] (ed.), ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1938) pp. 38\u201339.</ref> The elder Smith, however, was also called to give [[patriarchal blessing]]s to the fatherless within the church, and the church as a whole, a calling he passed onto his eldest surviving son [[Hyrum Smith]] prior to his death. Hyrum himself was killed in 1844 along with Joseph, resulting in a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] that broke the Latter Day Saint movement into multiple denominations.\n\nIt is not known who first identified the term \"evangelist\" with the office of patriarch. However, in an 1835 church publication, [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]] stated,\n\n:\"[W]ho is not desirous of receiving a father's or an evangelist's blessing? Who can read the ancient patriarchal blessings, recorded in the bible, for the benefit of the church, without a heart filled with joy ... ?\"<ref>W. W. Phelps (1835), ''[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ma/v1n10.htm Messenger and Advocate]'' 1(10): 146.</ref>\n\nIn 1839, Joseph Smith equated an evangelist with the office of patriarch, stating that \"an Evangelist is an Patriarch\".<ref name = HC/>\n\nThe necessity of an evangelist in the church organization has been reinforced repeatedly, based on the passage in Ephesians 4:11, which states, \"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers\". In 1834, while writing what he called the \"principles of salvation\", prominent early Latter Day Saint [[Oliver Cowdery]] stated that:\n\n:\"We do not believe that he ever had a church on earth without revealing himself to that church: consequently, there were apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, in the same.\"<ref>Oliver Cowdery (1834), ''[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ma/v1n01.htm Messenger and Advocate]'' 1(1): 2.</ref>\n\nJoseph Smith echoed Cowdery's statement in 1842, in a letter to a Chicago newspaper editor outlining the church's basic beliefs. Smith said that his religion \"believe[s] in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists\".<ref>[[Wentworth letter|Letter]] from Joseph Smith to [[John Wentworth (mayor)|John Wentworth]], 1842, reprinted in Joseph Smith, [http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&CISOPTR=9801&filename=4893.pdf \"Church History\"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' (Nauvoo, Illinois) 1842-03-01.</ref>\n\n==Community of Christ==\n{{Further|Presiding Patriarch}}\nIn the [[Community of Christ]], which was formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), an evangelist is an office in the Melchizedec Order of the [[Priesthood (Community of Christ)|priesthood]]. The evangelist was originally called an '''evangelist-patriarch'''. This name derived from Latter Day Saint founder Joseph Smith's statement that \"an Evangelist is a Patriarch. ... Wherever the Church of Christ is established in the earth, there should be a Patriarch for the benefit of the posterity of the Saints\".<ref name = HC>{{cite book | author=Smith, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Smith | editor=[[B.

The local evangelist\u2013patriarchs of the church were governed by an individual with church-wide authority known as the [[Presiding Patriarch]].\n\nIn 1984, when the first women began to be ordained to the office of evangelist-patriarch, the RLDS Church changed the title of the local evangelist-patriarchs to simply \"evangelist\". Similarly, it changed the title of the Presiding Patriarch to the \"Presiding Evangelist\". To be an evangelist, a person must also be a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] of the Melchizedec Order of the priesthood.\n\nThe primary duty of an evangelist in the Community of Christ remains the giving of sacramental \"evangelist's blessings\"; it is for this reason that evangelists are often referred to as \"ministers of blessing\". Ideally, an evangelist is free from administrative responsibilities in the church in order to allow them to be fully responsive to the [[Holy Spirit]]. Their blessings\u2014which are given by the [[laying on of hands]]\u2014provide counsel and advice and confer spiritual blessings upon the recipient. Evangelist's blessings may or may not be recorded. If it is recorded, a copy is stored in the church archives at [[Independence, Missouri]]. A recipient may receive multiple evangelist's blessings in their life.\n\nAll evangelists belong to the Order of Evangelists, which is directed by the Presiding Evangelist (currently [[Jane M. Gardner]], since 2016).\n\n==The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==\nIn [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], the prescribed duties of an evangelist are to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, language, and people. An evangelist is part of the [[Quorum of Seventy Evangelists]].\n\n===Quorum of Seventy Evangelists===\nThe [[Quorum of Seventy Evangelists]] is responsible for management of the International Missionary Programs of the church and assists Regions of the church with their individual Domestic Missionary Programs. The Quorum of Seventy oversees the activities of its Missionary Operating Committees to ensure the fulfilling of Christ\u2019s commandment to take the gospel to the entire world.<ref>[http://www.thechurchofjesuschrist.org/evangelist.htm Evangelists<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the officers of the Quorum of Seventy Evangelists were:\n\n*Evangelist Eugene Perri, President\n*Evangelist Alex Gentile, Vice-President\n*Evangelist Jeffrey Giannetti, Secretary\n\n==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==\n{{Main|Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)}}\nIn [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), an evangelist is considered to be an office of the [[Melchizedek priesthood]]. However, the term \"evangelist\" is rarely used for this position; instead, the church has retained the term \"patriarch\", the term most commonly used by Joseph Smith.\n\nThe most prominent reference to the term \"evangelist\" in the LDS Church's literature is found in its \"[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]]\", derived from the [[Wentworth letter]]\u2014a statement by Smith in 1842 to a Chicago newspaper editor\u2014that the church believes in \"the same organization that existed in the primitive church\", including \"evangelists\".<ref>[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]] [//www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.6#5 1:6].</ref> Smith taught that \"an Evangelist is an Patriarch\".<ref name = HC/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*Edwards, Paul M., [https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V17N03_8.pdf \"RLDS Priesthood: Structure and Process\",] ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''17'''(3) (1984) p.&nbsp;6.\n*{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Richard P.|title=The Ministry of Patriarch-Evangelists: A Brief Historical Survey|url=//www.cofchrist.org/common/cms/resources/Documents/priesthood/Ministry-of-Patriarch-Evangelists.doc|publisher=Community of Christ|accessdate=10 February 2016}}\n*[[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]] (2005).

Roman poets, particularly [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]],  and [[Ovid]], adopted the same form in Latin many years later.  As with the English [[heroic couplet|heroic]], each couplet usually makes sense on its own, while forming part of a larger work.\n\nEach couplet consists of a [[dactylic hexameter|hexameter]] verse followed by a [[dactylic pentameter|pentameter]] verse. The following is a graphic representation of its [[scansion]].  Note that - is a long syllable, u a short syllable, and U is either one long syllable or two short syllables:\n\n:::- U | - U | - U | - U | - u u | - -\n:::- U | - U | - || - u u | - u u | -\n\nThe form was felt by the ancients to contrast the rising action of the first verse with a falling quality in the second.  The sentiment is summarized in a line from Ovid's [[Amores (Ovid)|''Amores'']] I.1.27 ''Sex mihi surgat opus numeris, in quinque residat''\u2014\"Let my work rise in six steps, fall back in five.\"  The effect is illustrated by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] as:\n:In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column,\n:In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.\ntranslating [[Friedrich_Schiller|Schiller]],\n:Im Hexameter steigt des Springquells silberne S\u00e4ule,\n:Im Pentameter drauf f\u00e4llt sie melodisch herab.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coleridge|first=Samuel Taylor|title=The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsSnSa76NrsC&lpg=PA532&ots=PdCpQPkXgp&dq=schiller%20hexameter%20steigt&pg=PA532#v=onepage&q=schiller%20hexameter%20steigt&f=false|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=532}}</ref>\n\n==Greek origins<!--Linked from 'Aulos'-->==\n'''The elegiac couplet''' is presumed to be the oldest Greek form of [[epodic poetry]] (a form where a later verse is sung in response or comment to a previous one).  Scholars, who even in the past did not know who created it,<ref>[[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 77-78.</ref> theorize the form was originally used in Ionian dirges, with the name \"elegy\" derived from the Greek ''\u03b5, \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b5, \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5''\u2014\"Woe, cry woe, cry!\"  Hence, the form was used initially for funeral songs, typically accompanied by an [[aulos]], a double-reed instrument.  [[Archilochus]] expanded use of the form to treat other themes, such as war, travel, or homespun philosophy.  Between Archilochus and other imitators, the verse form became a common poetic vehicle for conveying any strong emotion.\n\nAt the end of the 7th century BCE, [[Mimnermus]] of Colophon struck on the innovation of using the verse for erotic poetry.  He composed several elegies celebrating his love for the flute girl Nanno, and though fragmentary today his poetry was clearly influential in the later Roman development of the form.  [[Propertius]], to cite one example, notes ''Plus in amore valet Mimnermi versus Homero''\u2014\"The verse of Mimnermus is stronger in love than Homer\".\n\nThe form continued to be popular throughout the Greek period and treated a number of different themes.  [[Tyrtaeus]] composed elegies on a war theme, apparently for a Spartan audience. [[Theognis of Megara]] vented himself in couplets as an embittered aristocrat in a time of social change. Popular leaders were writers of elegy\u2014[[Solon]] the lawgiver of Athens composed on political and ethical subjects\u2014and even [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] dabbled with the meter.  \n\nBy the [[Hellenistic period]], the [[Alexandrian_school#Literature|Alexandrian school]] made elegy its favorite and most highly developed form.  They preferred the briefer style associated with elegy in contrast to the lengthier epic forms, and made it the singular medium for short epigrams. The founder of this school was [[Philitas of Cos]]. He was eclipsed only by the school's most admired exponent, [[Callimachus]]; their learned character and intricate art would have a heavy influence on the Romans.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= Hellenistic poetry |author= A. W. Bulloch |editor= [[P.E. Easterling]]; [[Bernard M.W. Knox]] (eds.) |title= The Hellenistic Period and the Empire |series= The Cambridge History of Classical Literature |year=1985 |location=Cambridge |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-35984-8 |pages=1\u201381 |doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521210423.019}}</ref>\n\n==Roman elegy==\nLike many Greek forms, elegy was adapted by the Romans for their own literature.  The fragments of [[Ennius]] contain a few couplets, and scattered verses attributed to Roman public figures like [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]] also survive.\n\nBut it is the elegists of the mid-to-late first century BCE who are most commonly associated with the distinctive Roman form of the elegiac couplet.  [[Catullus]], the first of these, is an invaluable link between the Alexandrine school and the subsequent elegies of [[Tibullus]] and [[Propertius]] a generation later.  His collection, for example, shows a familiarity with the usual Alexandrine style of terse epigram and a wealth of mythological learning, while his 66th poem is a direct translation of Callimachus' ''Coma Berenices''.  Arguably the most famous elegiac couplet in Latin is his two-line 85th poem ''[[Odi et amo|Odi et Amo]]'':\n\n:::Odi et amo.

Other than a few scant lines, all of his work has been lost.\n\n==Elegy in the Augustan Age==\nThe form reached its zenith with the collections of [[Tibullus]], [[Propertius]], and several collections of [[Ovid]] (the ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]], [[Heroides]], [[Tristia]]'', and ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'').  The vogue of elegy during this time is seen in the so-called 3rd and 4th books of Tibullus.  Many poems in these books were clearly not written by Tibullus but by others, perhaps part of a circle under Tibullus' patron Mesalla.  Notable in this collection are the poems of [[Sulpicia]], the only surviving Latin literature written by a woman.\n\nThrough these poets\u2014and in comparison with the earlier Catullus\u2014it is possible to trace specific characteristics and evolutionary patterns in the Roman form of the verse:\n\n*The Roman authors often write about their own love affairs.  In contrast to their Greek originals, these poets are characters in his own stories, and write about love in a highly subjective way.\n*The form began to be applied to new themes beyond the traditional love, loss, and other \"strong emotion\" verse.  Propertius uses it to relate aetiological or \"origin\" myths such as the origins of Rome (IV.1) and the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine Hill (IV.6).  Ovid's ''[[Heroides]]''\u2014though at first glance fictitious love letters\u2014are described by Ovid himself as a new literary form, and can be read as character studies of famous heroines from mythology.   Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' is a lengthy elegiac poem on the first six months of the Roman calendar.\n*The Romans adopted the Alexandrine habit of concealing the name of their beloved in the poem with a pseudonym.  Catullus' vexing [[Lesbia]] is notorious as the pseudonym of the teasing Clodia.  But as the form developed, this habit becomes more artificial; Tibullus' Delia and Propertius' Cynthia, while likely real people, lack something of the specificity seen in Lesbia, while Ovid's Corinna is often considered a mere literary device.\n*The poets become extremely careful in forming the distinctive pentameter line of their verses.  Examples:\n**A trend toward the clear separation of the pentameter halves.  Catullus, for example, allows an elision across the [[caesura]] in 18 cases, a rare occurrence in the later poets (Ovid, for example, never does this).\n**The pentameter begins to show a semi-regular \"leonine\" rhyme between the two halves of the verse, e.g. Tib. I.1\u20132, where the ''culti'' ending the first half of the pentameter rhymes with the ''soli'' closing the verse:\n:::Divitias alius fulvo sibi congerat auro\n:::Et teneat culti iugera multa soli,\n**While Catullus shows this rhyme in about 1 in 5 couplets, the later elegists use it more frequently.  Propertius II.34, for example, has the rhyme in nearly half its pentameters.  Rhyming between adjacent lines and even in the two halves of the hexameter is also observed, more than would be expected by chance alone.\n**Unlike Catullus, later poets show a definite trend toward ending the pentameter with a two-syllable word.  Propertius is especially interesting; in his first two books, he ignores this rule about as frequently as Catullus and Tibullus, but in the last two books endings other than a disyllabic word are very rare.  Ovid has no exceptions to the disyllable in his [[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]], and only a few proper names occur as polysyllabic endings in his later work.\n*The hexameter follows the usual rhetorical trends of the [[dactylic hexameter]] in this age.  If anything, the elegists are even more interested in verbal effects like alliteration and assonance.\n\n==Post-Augustan writers==\nAlthough no classical poet wrote collections of love elegies after Ovid, the verse retained its popularity as a vehicle for popular [[occasional poetry]].  Elegiac verses appear, for example, in [[Petronius]]' ''Satyricon'', and [[Martial]]'s [[Epigrams]] uses it for many witty stand-alone couplets and for longer pieces.  The trend continues through the remainder of the empire; short elegies appear in [[Apuleius]]'s story ''Psyche and Cupid'' and the minor writings of [[Ausonius]].\n\n==Medieval elegy==\nAfter the fall of the empire, one writer who produced elegiac verse was [[Maximianus (poet)|Maximianus]]. Various Christian writers also adopted the form; [[Venantius Fortunatus]] wrote some of his hymns in the meter, while later [[Alcuin]] and the [[Venerable Bede]] dabbled in the verse.  The form also remained popular among the educated classes for gravestone epitaphs; many such epitaphs can be found in European cathedrals. \n\n''[[De tribus puellis]]'' is an example of a Latin ''[[fabliau]]'', a genre of [[comedy]] which employed elegiac couplets in imitation of Ovid. The medieval theorist [[John of Garland]] wrote that \"all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.\" [[Medieval Latin]] had a developed comedic genre known as [[elegiac comedy]]. Sometimes narrative, sometimes [[drama]]tic, it deviated from ancient practice because, as Ian Thompson writes, \"no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.\"\n\n==Renaissance and modern period==\nWith the Renaissance, more skilled writers interested in the revival of Roman culture took on the form in a way which attempted to recapture the spirit of the Augustan writers.  The Dutch Latinist [[Johannes Secundus]], for example, included Catullus-inspired love elegies in his ''Liber Basiorum'', while the English poet [[John Milton]] wrote several lengthy elegies throughout his career.  This trend continued down through the [[Recent Latin]] writers, whose close study of their Augustan counterparts reflects their general attempts to apply the cultural and literary forms of the ancient world to contemporary themes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prosody (Latin)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~loxias/latinverse.htm Reading Latin Verse Aloud: Metre and Scansion]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080119132354/http://classics.rutgers.edu/Lat327/def.html What is Elegy?

A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.\n\n===Geological era===\n{{main|Era (geology)}}\nIn large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. \nThe next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.<ref>Short, N.M. (2009).

[[Anno mundi]] (\"year of the world\") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. \n\nThe [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH (\"After Hijra\").\n\nFor a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''k\u014dki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.\n\nMany [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as \"BE\" for \"Buddhist Era\"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].\n\nOther calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' (\"AUC\"), counting from the foundation of the city.\n\n===Regnal eras===\n{{main|Regnal year}}\nThe word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.\n \nIn [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:\n\n*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]\n*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]\n*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]\n*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]\n\nA similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that \"61 & 62 Vict c. 37\" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\n===Historiography===\n\"Era\" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.\nUse of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include [[Soviet era]], and \"[[:Category:History of European art music|musical eras]]\" in the history of modern [[popular music]], such as the \"[[Big Band|Big Band era]]\", \"[[Disco era]]\", etc.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Periodization]]\n*[[List of time periods]]\n*[[List of archaeological periods]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Chronology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Chronology]]\n[[Category:Units of time]]", "sha1": "b514f8tfqmydq36n52h97fhlwy0w4ie"}}, {"title": "Eschatology", "ns": "0", "id": "9760", "revision": {"id": "866735642", "parentid": "865266866", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T06:19:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m", "id": "2615838"}, "comment": "Linked to concept", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Theological views of the end of the world}}\n{{redirect|Last Things|the C.

In many [[religion]]s it is taught as an existing future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]].\n\nHistory is often divided into \"ages\" ([[aeons]]), which are time periods each with certain commonalities. One age comes to an end and a new age or [[world to come]], where different realities are present, begins. When such transitions from one age to another are the subject of eschatological discussion, the phrase, \"end of the world\", is replaced by \"end of the age\", \"end of an era\", or \"end of life as we know it\". Much [[apocalyptic fiction]] does not deal with the \"end of time\" but rather with the end of a certain period, the end of life as it is now, and the beginning of a new period. It is usually a crisis that brings an end to current reality and ushers in a new way of living, thinking, or being. This crisis may take the form of the intervention of a deity in history, a war, a change in the environment, or the reaching of a new level of consciousness.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sofroniou |first=Andreas |title=Philosophy and Science of Eschatology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Vc1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2017 |publisher=[[Lulu.com]] |isbn=9780244632243 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=7Vc1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77&dq=%22+of+the+intervention+of+a+deity+in+history,+a+war,+a+change+in+the+environment,+or+the+reaching+of+a+new+level+of+consciousness%22 77]}}</ref>\n\nMost modern eschatology and [[apocalypticism]], both religious and secular, involve the violent disruption or destruction of the world; whereas Christian and Jewish eschatologies view the end times as the consummation or perfection of God's creation of the world,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=Sean |title=The Big Picture.

For example, according to some ancient Hebrew worldviews, reality unfolds along a linear path (or rather, a spiral path, with cyclical components that nonetheless have a linear trajectory); the world began with God and is ultimately headed toward God's final goal for creation, the world to come.<ref>Sofroniou, Andreas (2017). p.

In some eschatologies, conditions are better for some and worse for others, e.g. \"heaven and hell\". They also vary as to the time frame.

In the Old Testament, apocalyptic eschatology can be found notably in [[Isaiah]] 24\u201327, Isaiah 56\u201366, [[Book of Joel|Joel]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9\u201314 as well as closing chapters of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]].<ref name=NBD>Bauckham, R.

Leicester, England; Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press.</ref> In the New Testament, applicable passages include [[Matthew 24]], [[Mark 13]], the [[parable]] of \"[[The Sheep and the Goats]]\" and in the [[Book of Revelation]]\u2014although Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.\n\nThe [[Second Coming]] of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology within the broader context of the fullness of the [[Kingdom_of_God_(Christianity)|Kingdom of God]]. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.\n\nThe Book of Revelation is at the core of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or [[hermeneutic]]s. In the [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]] approach, Revelation is treated mostly as unfulfilled prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In the [[Preterism|Preterist]] approach, Revelation is chiefly interpreted as having prophetic fulfillment in the past, principally, the events of the first century CE, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and the desecration of the Temple in the same year. In the [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] approach, Revelation provides a broad view of history, and passages in Revelation are identified with major historical people and events. In the [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]] (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.\n\n==== Messianic Judaism ====\n{{Main|Messianic Jewish theology#Eschatology}}\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|Hindu eschatology}}\nContemporary Hindu eschatology is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] before the age draws to a close who will reincarnate as [[Shiva]] and simultaneously dissolve and regenerate the universe.\n\nMost Hindus believe that the current period is the [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four ''Yuga'' that make up the current age. Each period has seen successive degeneration in the moral order, to the point that in the Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are the norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or \"[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]\". Each kalpa lasts 4.1 \u2013 8.2 billion years, which is one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of [[Brahma|birth]], [[Vishnu|growth]], [[Shiva|decay]], and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief. Some Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|Islamic eschatology}}\n[[Islamic eschatology]] is documented in the [[Hadith|sayings]] of the [[Prophet of Islam|Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], regarding the Signs of the Day of Judgement. The Prophet's sayings on the subject have been traditionally divided into Major and Minor Signs. He spoke about several Minor Signs of the approach of the Day of Judgment, including:\n* [[Abu Hurairah]] reported that [[Muhammad]] said: \"If you survive for a time you would certainly see people who would have whips in their hands like the tail of an ox. They would get up in the morning under the wrath of God and they would go into the evening with the anger of God.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n* [[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said, \"When honesty is lost, then wait for the Day of Judgment.\" It was asked, \"How will honesty be lost, O Messenger of God?\" He said, \"When authority is given to those who do not deserve it, then wait for the Day of Judgment.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n* [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b]], in a long narration, relating to the questions of the angel [[Gabriel#Islamic references|Gabriel]], reported: \"Inform me when the Day of Judgment will be.\" He [the Prophet Muhammad] remarked: \"The one who is being asked knows no more than the inquirer.\" He [the inquirer] said: \"Tell me about its indications.\" He [the Prophet Muhammad] said: \"That the slave-girl gives birth to her mistress and master, and that you would find barefooted, destitute shepherds of goats vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n* \"Before the Day of Judgment there will be great liars, so beware of them.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n* \"When the most wicked member of a tribe becomes its ruler, and the most worthless member of a community becomes its leader, and a man is respected through fear of the evil he may do, and leadership is given to people who are unworthy of it, expect the Day of Judgment.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nRegarding the Major Signs, a [[Sahaba|Companion of the Prophet]] narrated: \"Once we were sitting together and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us what it was we were discussing. We said it was the Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, [[Dajjal]] (the [[Antichrist]]), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the [[Second Coming#Islam|Second Coming]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], the emergence of [[Gog and Magog#Qur'an|Gog and Magog]], and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].'\" (note: the previous events were not listed in the chronological order of appearance){{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== Judaism ===\n{{Main|Jewish eschatology}}\nJewish eschatology is concerned with events that will happen in the [[End time|end of days]], according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] and Jewish thought. This includes the ingathering of the exiled [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the coming of the [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah]], [[afterlife]], and the [[Techiyat hamaysim|revival of the dead Tzadikim]].\n\nIn Judaism, the end times are usually called the \"end of days\" (''a\u1e25arit ha-yamim'', \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd), a phrase that appears several times in the [[Tanakh]]. The idea of a [[messianic age]] has a prominent place in Jewish thought and is incorporated as part of the end of days.\n\n[[Judaism]] addresses the [[end time]]s in the [[Book of Daniel]] and numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the [[Talmud]], particularly Tractate [[Avodah Zarah]].\n\n=== Zoroastrianism ===\n{{Main|Frashokereti}}\nFrashokereti is the [[Zoroastrian]] doctrine of a final renovation of the universe when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will then be in perfect unity with God ([[Ahura Mazda]]). The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the \"salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.\" Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.<ref name=\"Boyce\">{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1979|location=London|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-415-23902-8|pages=27\u201329|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}.</ref>\n\n== Analogies in science and philosophy ==\n{{Main|Global catastrophic risk}}\n\n=== Futures studies and transhumanism ===\nResearchers in [[futures studies]] and [[transhumanists]] investigate how the accelerating rate of scientific progress may lead to a \"[[technological singularity]]\" in the future that would profoundly and unpredictably change the course of human history, and result in ''Homo sapiens'' no longer being the dominant life form on Earth.<ref name=\"agi-conf\">[[Anders Sandberg|Sandberg, Anders]].

Thus, some parts of Christianity did not attend later councils, or attended but did not accept the results. Bishops belonging to what became known as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] accept only seven ecumenical councils, as described [[Ecumenical council#Eastern Orthodox Church|below]].  Bishops belonging to what became known as the [[Church of the East]] only participated in the first two councils. Bishops belonging to what became known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] participated in the first four councils, but rejected the decisions of the fourth and did not attend any subsequent ecumenical councils.\n\nAcceptance of councils as ecumenical and authoritative varies between different [[Christian denominations]]. Disputes over [[christological]] and other questions have led certain branches to reject some councils that others accept.\n\n== Acceptance of councils by denomination ==\nThe [[Church of the East]] (accused by others of adhering to [[Nestorianism]]) accepts as ecumenical only the first two councils. [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]] accept the first three.<ref>[http://www.holypimoly.com/images/im_about_ortho/coptic_church.pdf Coptic Orthodox Christian Center, \"The Coptic Church\"]</ref> Both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]] recognise as ecumenical the first seven councils, held from the 4th to the 9th century. While the Eastern Orthodox Church accepts no later [[council]] or [[synod]] as ecumenical, the Roman Catholic Church continues to hold general councils of the bishops in [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]], reckoning them as ecumenical. In all, the Roman Catholic Church recognises twenty-one councils as ecumenical. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and confessional [[Protestantism|Protestants]] accept either the first seven or the first four as ecumenical councils.\n\n==Infallibility of ecumenical councils==\n{{see also|Infallibility of the Church}}\nThe doctrine of the ''infallibility of ecumenical councils'' states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, which concern faith or morals, and to which the whole Church must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees are often labeled as 'Canons' and they often have an attached [[anathema]], a penalty of [[excommunication]], against those who refuse to believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is dogmatic, but that every aspect of an ecumenical council is free of errors or is indefectible.<ref>St Thomas Aquinas, S. Th. II, II, q. 11, a. 2 \"Now a thing may be of the faith in two ways, in one way, directly and principally, e.g. the articles of faith; in another way, indirectly and secondarily, e.g. those matters, the denial of which leads to the corruption of some article of faith; and there may be heresy in either way, even as there can be faith.\" http://newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article2</ref>\n\nBoth the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic churches uphold versions of this doctrine. However, the Roman Catholic Church holds that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils meet the conditions of infallibility only when approved by the Pope,<ref>[[First Vatican Council|Vatican I]], ''Dei Filius'' ch. 3 \u00b6 1.  [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]], ''Lumen Gentium'' \u00a7 25 \u00b6 2.  1983 Code of Canon Law 749 \u00a7 2.</ref> while the Eastern Orthodox Church holds that an ecumenical council is itself infallible when pronouncing on a specific matter.<ref>\"The infallibility of the Church does not mean that the Church, in the assembly of the Fathers or in the expression of the Conscience of the Church, has already formally expressed all the truths of faith and norms. The infallibility of the Church is confined to the formulation of truths in question. This infallibility is not wholly a God-inspired energy which would affect the participants of the synod to such an extent that they would be inspired to pronounce all the truths at one time as a whole system of a Christian catechism. The Synod does not formulate a system of beliefs encompassing all Christian teachings and truths, but only endeavors to define the particular disputed truth which was misunderstood and misinterpreted. The Church of Christ and its divine nature, as set forth above, is the foundation upon which the Eastern Orthodox Church [sic.] continues to administer and nourish its faithful, thereby protecting its fundamental essentials.\"  Rev. George Mastrantonis, of the [[Archbishop of America|Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]].</ref>\n\nProtestant churches would generally view ecumenical councils as fallible human institutions that have no more than a derived authority to the extent that they correctly expound Scripture (as most would generally consider occurred with the first four councils in regard to their dogmatic decisions).<ref>Hans Schneider, \"Councils of the Church\", The Encyclopedia of Christianity (Grand Rapids, Michigan; Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill, 1999\u20132003), 701.</ref>\n\n==Council documents==\nChurch councils were, from the beginning, bureaucratic exercises. Written documents were circulated, speeches made and responded to, votes taken, and final documents published and distributed. A large part of what is known about the beliefs of [[Christian heresy|heresies]] comes from the documents quoted in councils in order to be refuted, or indeed only from the deductions based on the refutations.\n\nMost councils dealt not only with doctrinal but also with disciplinary matters, which were decided in ''[[Canon law|canon]]s'' (\"laws\"). Study of the canons of church councils is the foundation of the development of [[canon law]], especially the reconciling of seemingly contradictory canons or the determination of priority between them. Canons consist of doctrinal statements and disciplinary measures \u2013 most Church councils and local synods dealt with immediate disciplinary concerns as well as major difficulties of doctrine. Eastern Orthodoxy typically views the purely doctrinal canons as [[dogma]]tic and applicable to the entire church at all times, while the disciplinary canons apply to a particular time and place and may or may not be applicable in other situations.\n\n==Circumstances of the first ecumenical councils==\nOf the seven councils recognised in whole or in part by both the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church as ecumenical, all were called by a [[Roman emperor]].<ref>Thomas J.

Local meetings of hierarchs have been called \"pan-Orthodox\", but these have invariably been simply meetings of local hierarchs of whatever Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions are party to a specific local matter. From this point of view, there has been no fully \"pan-Orthodox\" ('''Ecumenical''') council since 787. Unfortunately, the use of the term \"pan-Orthodox\" is confusing to those not within Eastern Orthodoxy, and it leads to mistaken impressions that these are ''[[ersatz]]'' ecumenical councils rather than purely local councils to which nearby Orthodox hierarchs, regardless of jurisdiction, are invited.\n\nOthers, including 20th century theologians Metropolitan [[Hierotheos (Vlachos)]] of [[Naupactus]], Fr.

Independency or [[congregationalist polity]] among Protestants may involve the rejection of any governmental structure or binding authority above local congregations; conformity to the decisions of these councils is therefore considered purely voluntary and the councils are to be considered binding only insofar as those doctrines are derived from the Scriptures. Many of these churches reject the idea that anyone other than the authors of Scripture can directly lead other Christians by original divine authority; after the [[New Testament]], they assert, the doors of revelation were closed and councils can only give advice or guidance, but have no authority. They consider new doctrines not derived from the sealed [[Biblical canon|canon]] of Scripture to be both impossible and unnecessary whether proposed by church councils or by more recent [[prophet]]s. Catholic and Orthodox objections to this position point to the fact that the [[Biblical canon|Canon of Scripture]] itself was fixed by these councils. They conclude that this would lead to a logical inconsistency of a non-authoritative body fixing a supposedly authoritative source.\n\n===Nontrinitarian churches===\nEcumenical councils are not recognised by [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] churches such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (and other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Church of God (Seventh-Day)]], their descendants and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]].

More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet transited in front of it.\n\nInitially, most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars.

Exoplanets found with low orbital eccentricity, near circular orbits, are almost all very close to their star and are tidally locked to the star. In contrast, seven out of eight planets in the Solar System have near-circular orbits. The exoplanets discovered show that the solar system, with its unusually low eccentricity, is rare and unique.<ref>[http://exoplanets.org/ecc.html exoplanets.org, ORBITAL ECCENTRICITES, by G.Marcy, P.Butler, D.Fischer, S.Vogt, 20 Sept 2003]</ref> One theory attributes this low eccentricity to the high number of planets in the Solar System; another suggests it arose because of its unique asteroid belts. A few other [[List of multiplanetary systems|multiplanetary systems]] have been found, but none resemble the Solar System. The Solar System has unique [[planetesimal]] systems, which led the planets to have near-circular orbits. The exoplanet systems discovered have either no planetesimal systems or one very large one.

Increased cloud-column depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths, but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths. Optical albedo increases with age, because older planets have higher cloud-column depths. Optical albedo decreases with increasing mass, because higher-mass giant planets have higher surface gravities, which produces lower cloud-column depths. Also, elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition, which can have a significant effect.<ref name=\"wfirstreturn\">{{cite arXiv|eprint=1412.6097|last1=Burrows|first1=Adam|title=Scientific Return of Coronagraphic Exoplanet Imaging and Spectroscopy Using WFIRST|class=astro-ph.EP|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThere is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared wavelengths for massive and/or young gas giants.

Initially supportive of that country's [[October Revolution]] that brought the [[Bolsheviks]] to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]; she denounced the [[Soviet Union]] for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923, she published a book about her experiences, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called ''[[Living My Life]]''. It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], Goldman traveled to Spain to support the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|anarchist revolution]] there. She died in [[Toronto]], Canada, on May 14, 1940, aged 70.\n\nDuring her life, Goldman was lionized as a [[freethought|freethinking]] \"rebel woman\" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122\u2013134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}</ref> Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[prison abolition movement|prisons]], [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and [[homosexuality]]. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Family ===\nEmma Goldman was born into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family in Kovno in the Russian Empire, which is now known as [[Kaunas]] in [[Lithuania]].<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 24.</ref> Goldman's mother Taube Bienowitch had been married before to a man with whom she had two daughters\u2014Helena in 1860 and Lena in 1862. When her first husband died of [[tuberculosis]], Taube was devastated. Goldman later wrote: \"Whatever love she had had died with the young man to whom she had been married at the age of fifteen.\"<ref name=\"EGLiv447\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 447.</ref>\n\nTaube's second [[arranged marriage|marriage was arranged]] by her family and, as Goldman puts it, \"mismated from the first\".<ref name=\"EGLiv447\"/> Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube's inheritance in a business that quickly failed. The ensuing hardship, combined with the emotional distance of husband and wife, made the household a tense place for the children. When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would be one more sign of failure.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 5.</ref> They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma.<ref>The order of birth is unclear; Wexler (in ''Intimate'', p. 13) notes that although Goldman writes as being her mother's fourth child, her brother Louis (who died at the age of six) was probably born after her.</ref>\n\nEmma Goldman was born on June 27, 1869.<ref>Chalberg, p. 12.</ref> Her father used violence to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them.<ref>Chalberg, p. 13.</ref> Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 12.</ref> Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.<ref name=\"EGLiv447\"/>\n\nGoldman's relationships with her elder half-sisters, Helena and Lena, were a study in contrasts. Helena, the oldest, provided the comfort the children lacked from their mother; she filled Goldman's childhood with \"whatever joy it had\".<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 11.</ref> Lena, however, was distant and uncharitable.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 12.</ref> The three sisters were joined by brothers Louis (who died at the age of six), Herman (born in 1872), and Moishe (born in 1879).<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\n=== Adolescence ===\n[[File:Emma Goldman's family.jpg|thumb|right|Emma Goldman's family in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1882. From left to right: Emma, standing; Helena, seated, with Morris on her lap; Taube; Herman; Abraham.]]\nWhen Emma was a young girl, the Goldman family moved to the village of [[Papil\u0117]], where her father ran an inn. While her sisters worked, she became friends with a servant named Petrushka, who excited her \"first erotic sensations\".<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 20.</ref> Later in Papil\u0117 she witnessed a peasant being whipped with a [[knout]] in the street. This event traumatized her and contributed to her lifelong distaste for violent authority.<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 28.</ref>\n\nAt the age of seven, Goldman moved with her family to the Prussian city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (then part of the German Empire), and she was enrolled in a ''[[Realschule]]''. One teacher punished disobedient students\u2014targeting Goldman in particular\u2014by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and she was unable to attend.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe family moved to the Russian capital of [[Saint Petersburg]], where her father opened one unsuccessful store after another. Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs, including one in a [[corset]] shop.<ref>Chalberg, p. 15.</ref> As a teenager Goldman begged her father to allow her to return to school, but instead he threw her French book into the fire and shouted: \"Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to know is how to prepare [[gefilte fish]], cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty of children.\"<ref name=\"EGLiv12\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 12.</ref>\n\nGoldman pursued an independent education [[autodidact|on her own]], however, and soon began to study the political turmoil around her, particularly the [[Nihilist movement|Nihilists]] responsible for assassinating [[Alexander II of Russia]]. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]]'s novel, ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera. She adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing [[cooperative]]. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source of inspiration throughout her life.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nHer father, meanwhile, continued to insist on a domestic future for her, and he tried to arrange for her to be married at the age of fifteen. They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a \"loose\" woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone.<ref name=\"JC16\">Chalberg, p. 16.</ref> At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men. One persistent suitor took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman described as \"violent contact\";<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 22.</ref> two biographers call it rape.<ref name=\"JC16\"/><ref>Falk, ''Love'', p. 14.</ref> She was stunned by the experience, overcome by \"shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful.\"<ref name=\"EGLiv23\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 23.</ref> Goldman felt that the encounter forever soured her interactions with men.<ref name=\"EGLiv23\"/>\n\n=== Rochester, New York ===\n[[File:Emma goldman 1886.jpg|thumb|upright|Emma Goldman in 1886]]\nIn 1885, her sister Helena made plans to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer to pay for the trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman threatened to throw herself into the [[Neva River]] if she could not go. Their father finally agreed. On December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's [[Castle Garden]], the entry for immigrants.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nThey settled upstate, living in the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising [[antisemitism]] of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a [[seamstress]], sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nAt her new job, Goldman met a fellow worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared her love for books, dancing, and traveling, as well as her frustration with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887.<ref>Falk, ''Love'', pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her\u2014particularly the aftermath of executions related to the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] in Chicago and the [[anti-authoritarian]] political philosophy of [[anarchism]].\n\nLess than a year after the wedding, the couple were divorced; Kershner begged Goldman to return and threatened to poison himself if she did not. They reunited, but after three months she left once again. Her parents considered her behavior \"loose\" and refused to allow Goldman into their home.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 15\u201317.</ref>  Carrying her sewing machine in one hand and a bag with five dollars in the other, she left Rochester and headed southeast to New York City.<ref>Chalberg, p. 27.</ref>\n\n=== Most and Berkman ===\n[[File:Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman.jpg|thumb|Goldman enjoyed a decades-long relationship with her lover [[Alexander Berkman]]. Photo c. 1917\u20131919.]]\n\nOn her first day in the city, Goldman met two men who greatly changed her life. At Sachs's Caf\u00e9, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to [[Alexander Berkman]], an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear [[Johann Most]], editor of a radical publication called ''[[Freiheit (1879)|Freiheit]]'' and an advocate of \"[[propaganda of the deed]]\"\u2014the use of violence to instigate change.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> She was impressed by his fiery oration, and Most took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking. He encouraged her vigorously, telling her that she was \"to take my place when I am gone.\"<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 40.</ref>  One of her first public talks in support of \"the Cause\" was in Rochester. After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage. She later wrote, suddenly:<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 51.</ref>\n{{quote|something strange happened. In a flash I saw it\u2014every incident of my three years in Rochester: the Garson factory, its drudgery and humiliation, the failure of my marriage, the Chicago crime...I began to speak. Words I had never heard myself utter before came pouring forth, faster and faster. They came with passionate intensity...The audience had vanished, the hall itself had disappeared; I was conscious only of my own words, of my ecstatic song.}}\n\nExcited by the experience, Goldman refined her public persona during subsequent engagements. Quickly, however, she found herself arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], she felt as though she had become \"a parrot repeating Most's views\"<ref name=\"Goldman-Living-52\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 52.</ref> and resolved to express herself on the stage. When she returned to New York, Most became furious and told her: \"Who is not with me is against me!\"<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 54.</ref> She left ''Freiheit'' and joined another publication, ''[[Die Autonomie]]''.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 53.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Goldman had begun a friendship with Berkman, whom she affectionately called Sasha. Before long they became lovers and moved into a communal apartment with his cousin [[Modest Stein|Modest \"Fedya\" Stein]] and Goldman's friend, Helen Minkin, on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]].<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 57.</ref>  Although their relationship had numerous difficulties, Goldman and Berkman would share a close bond for decades, united by their anarchist principles and commitment to personal equality.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 57\u201358.</ref>\n\n[[File:Emma Goodman\u2019s ice cream shop (photographed in 2017).jpg|thumb|right|Site of the ice cream shop in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] operated by Goldman, Berkman and Stein, photographed in 2017]]\nIn 1892, Goldman joined with Berkman and Stein in opening an ice cream shop in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  After a few months of operating the shop, however, Goldman and Berkman were diverted by becoming involved in the [[Homestead Strike]] in western Pennsylvania near [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web | title = People & Events: Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919) | publisher = [[PBS]] | date = March 11, 2004 | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_frick.html | accessdate = July 10, 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150712130323/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_frick.html | archivedate = July 12, 2015 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Southwick | first = Albert B. | title = Emma Goldman pays a visit | newspaper = [[Telegram & Gazette]] | location = [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] | date = June 26, 2014 | url = http://www.telegram.com/article/20140626/COLUMN21/306269974/0 | accessdate = July 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Homestead plot ===\n{{further|Homestead Strike}}\nBerkman and Goldman came together through the [[Homestead Strike]]. In June 1892, a steel plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] owned by [[Andrew Carnegie]] became the focus of national attention when talks between the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was [[Henry Clay Frick]], a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. [[Strikebreaker]]s were brought in and the company hired [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton guards]] to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Clay Frick.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman and Berkman believed that a retaliatory assassination of [[Carnegie Steel Company]] manager [[Henry Clay Frick]] (''pictured'') would \"strike terror into the soul of his class\" and \"bring the teachings of Anarchism before the world\".<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 63.</ref>]]\n\nWhen a majority of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would be in charge of \"the deed\"; she of the associated propaganda.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 63\u201365.</ref> Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes.\n\nGoldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), she mused: \"She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?\"<ref name=\"EGLiv91\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 91.</ref> Once on the street, Goldman caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have \"the knack,\" and told her to quit the business. She was \"too astounded for speech\".<ref name=\"EGLiv91\"/> She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 45.</ref>\n\nOn July 23, Berkman gained access to Frick's office while carrying a concealed handgun; he shot Frick three times, and stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers\u2014far from joining in his ''attentat''\u2014beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 42\u201343; Falk, ''Love'', p. 25; Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 65.</ref> Berkman was convicted of attempted murder<ref>{{cite news |title=Alexander Berkman, the Anarchist, to Be Deported; Case of Emma Goldman Now Up for Decision|work=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1919|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/26/archives/alexander-berkman-the-anarchist-to-be-deported-case-of-emma-goldman.html}}</ref> and sentenced to 22 years in prison.<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 106.</ref> Goldman suffered during his long absence.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nConvinced Goldman was involved in the plot, police raided her apartment. Although they found no evidence, they pressured her landlord into evicting her. Worse, the ''attentat'' had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman's action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it on her knee, and hurled the pieces at him.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 65\u201366.</ref><ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 105.</ref> She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: \"At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason.\"<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 66.</ref>\n\n=== \"Inciting to riot\" ===\nWhen the [[Panic of 1893]] struck in the following year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year's end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20%,<ref>[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=538 \"Panic of 1893\"].

Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated men and women in New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to \"take everything&nbsp;...&nbsp;by force\".<ref>Quoted in Chalberg, p. 46.</ref> But Goldman later recounted this message: \"Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread.\"<ref name=\"EGLiv123\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 123.</ref> Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\n[[File:Emma Goldman surrounded by crowd.jpg|thumb|Goldman (shown here in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], New York in 1916) urged unemployed workers to take [[direct action]] rather than depend on charity or government aid.]]\n\nA week later Goldman was arrested in [[Philadelphia]] and returned to New York City for trial, charged with \"inciting to riot\".<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 76.</ref> During the train ride, Jacobs offered to drop the charges against her if she would inform on other radicals in the area. She responded by throwing a glass of ice water in his face.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 57.</ref>  As she awaited trial, Goldman was visited by [[Nellie Bly]], a reporter for the ''[[New York World]].'' She spent two hours talking to Goldman, and wrote a positive article about the woman she described as a \"modern [[Joan of Arc]].\"<ref>[[Nellie Bly]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20150415182809/http://sunsite3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Samples/bly.html \"Nelly Bly Again: She Interviews Emma Goldman and Other Anarchists\"], ''[[New York World]]'', September 17, 1893.<!--The reporter's name was spelled Nellie Bly, but the article's title spelled it \"Nelly\" Bly.--></ref>\n\nDespite this positive publicity, the jury was persuaded by Jacobs' testimony and frightened by Goldman's politics. The assistant District Attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, as well as her atheism; the judge spoke of her as \"a dangerous woman\".<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 60.</ref> She was sentenced to one year in the [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]] Penitentiary. Once inside she suffered an attack of [[rheumatism]] and was sent to the infirmary; there she befriended a visiting doctor and began studying medicine. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]; poet [[Walt Whitman]], and philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]].<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 78.</ref> When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people greeted her at the [[Bowery Theatre|Thalia Theater]] in New York City. She soon became swamped with requests for interviews and lectures.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nTo make money, Goldman decided to pursue the medical work she had studied in prison. However, her preferred fields of specialization\u2014[[midwifery]] and [[massage]]\u2014were not available to nursing students in the US. She sailed to Europe, lecturing in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. She met with renowned anarchists such as [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Louise Michel]], and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. In [[Vienna]], she received two diplomas for midwifery and put them immediately to use back in the US.\n\nAlternating between lectures and midwifery, Goldman conducted the first cross-country tour by an anarchist speaker. In November 1899 she returned to Europe to speak, where she met the Czech anarchist [[Hippolyte Havel]] in London. They went together to France and helped organize the 1900 International Anarchist Congress on the outskirts of Paris.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 84\u201389.</ref> Afterward Havel immigrated to the United States, traveling with her to Chicago. They shared a residence there with friends of Goldman.\n\n=== McKinley assassination ===\n{{further|Assassination of William McKinley}}\n[[File:First photograph of Leon F.

McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 65\u201366.</ref> Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to a residence in Chicago she shared with Hippolyte Havel, who had come to the US; as well as with Mary and [[Abe Isaak]], an anarchist couple and their family.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 68.</ref><ref>Chalberg, p. 73.</ref> Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 104.</ref>\n\n[[File:Newspaper article blaming Emma Goldman for inspiring Czolgosz to assassinate McKinley.jpg|thumb|upright|Propaganda published in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', September 8, 1901, blaming Emma Goldman for inspiring Leon Czolgosz to assassinate President William McKinley.]]\nEarlier, Czolgosz had tried but failed to become friends with Goldman and her companions. During a talk in Cleveland, Czolgosz had approached Goldman and asked her advice on which books he should read. In July 1901, he had appeared at the Isaak house, asking a series of unusual questions. They assumed he was an infiltrator, like a number of police agents sent to spy on radical groups. They had remained distant from him, and Abe Isaak sent a notice to associates warning of \"another spy\".<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\nAlthough Czolgosz repeatedly denied Goldman's involvement, the police held her in close custody, subjecting her to what she called the \"[[Third degree (interrogation)|third degree]]\".<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 300.</ref> She explained her housemates' distrust of Czolgosz, and the police finally recognized that she had not had any significant contact with the attacker. No evidence was found linking Goldman to the attack, and she was released after two weeks of detention. Before McKinley died, Goldman offered to provide nursing care, referring to him as \"merely a human being\".<ref>Quoted in Chalberg, p. 76.</ref> Czolgosz, despite considerable evidence of [[mental illness]], was convicted of murder and executed.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 74.</ref>\n\nThroughout her detention and after her release, Goldman steadfastly refused to condemn Czolgosz's actions, standing virtually alone in doing so. Friends and supporters\u2014including Berkman\u2014urged her to quit his cause. But Goldman defended Czolgosz as a \"supersensitive being\"<ref name=\"Cha78\">Chalberg, p. 78.</ref> and chastised other anarchists for abandoning him.<ref name=\"Cha78\"/> She was vilified in the press as the \"high priestess of anarchy\",<ref>Falk, ''The American Years'', p. 461.</ref> while many newspapers declared the anarchist movement responsible for the murder.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 106\u2013112.</ref> In the wake of these events, [[socialism]] gained support over anarchism among US radicals. McKinley's successor, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], declared his intent to crack down \"not only against anarchists, but against all active and passive sympathizers with anarchists\".<ref>Quoted in Chalberg, p. 81.</ref>\n\n=== ''Mother Earth'' and Berkman's release ===\n[[File:Emma Goldman 1901 mugshot (single portrait).png|thumb|left|upright|Mug shot taken in 1901 when Goldman was implicated in the assassination of President McKinley.]]\n{{main|Mother Earth (magazine)}}\nAfter Czolgosz was executed, Goldman withdrew from the world. Scorned by her fellow anarchists, vilified by the press, and separated from her love, Berkman, she retreated into anonymity and nursing. \"It was bitter and hard to face life anew,\" she wrote later.<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 318.</ref>\n\nUsing the name E. G. Smith, she left public life and took on a series of private nursing jobs.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 115.</ref>  When the US Congress passed the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]] (1903), however, a new wave of activism rose to oppose it, and Goldman was pulled back into the movement. A coalition of people and organizations across the [[left-wing politics|left]] end of the political spectrum opposed the law on grounds that it violated [[freedom of speech]], and she had the nation's ear once again.\n\nAfter an English anarchist named [[John Turner (anarchist)|John Turner]] was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Goldman joined forces with the [[Free Speech League]] to champion his cause.<ref>Falk, ''Making Speech Free'', p. 557.</ref> The league enlisted the aid of noted attorneys [[Clarence Darrow]] and [[Edgar Lee Masters]], who took Turner's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 84\u201387.</ref> She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. \"I never felt so weighed down,\" she wrote to Berkman. \"I fear I am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others.\"<ref>Quoted in Chalberg, p. 87.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mother Earth 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldman's ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' magazine became a home to radical activists and literary free thinkers around the US.]]\n\nIn 1906, Goldman decided to start a publication, \"a place of expression for the young idealists in arts and letters\".<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 377.</ref> ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' was staffed by a cadre of radical activists, including Hippolyte Havel, [[Max Baginski]], and [[Leonard Abbott]]. In addition to publishing original works by its editors and anarchists around the world, ''Mother Earth'' reprinted selections from a variety of writers. These included the French philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]], German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and British writer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Goldman wrote frequently about anarchism, politics, labor issues, atheism, sexuality, and feminism, and was the first editor of the magazine.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 88\u201391.</ref><ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 121\u2013130.</ref>\n\nOn May 18 of the same year, Alexander Berkman was released from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform and found herself \"seized by terror and pity\"<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 384.</ref> as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home in silence. For weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside. An abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver with the intent of killing himself.<ref>Chalberg, p. 94.</ref><ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 97\u201398.</ref>  He returned to New York, however, and learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of [[freedom of assembly]], he declared, \"My resurrection has come!\"<ref>Quoted in Goldman, ''Living'', p. 391.</ref> and set about securing their release.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 98.</ref>\n\nBerkman took the helm of ''Mother Earth'' in 1907, while Goldman toured the country to raise funds to keep it operating. Editing the magazine was a revitalizing experience for Berkman. But his relationship with Goldman faltered, and he had an affair with a 15-year-old anarchist named [[Becky Edelsohn]]. Goldman was pained by his rejection of her, but considered it a consequence of his prison experience.<ref>Chalberg, p. 97.</ref>  Later that year she served as a delegate from the US to the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]]. Anarchists and [[syndicalism|syndicalists]] from around the world gathered to sort out the tension between the two ideologies, but no decisive agreement was reached. Goldman returned to the US and continued speaking to large audiences.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 135\u2013137.</ref>\n\n=== Reitman, essays, and birth control ===\nFor the next ten years, Goldman traveled around the country nonstop, delivering lectures and agitating for anarchism. The coalitions formed in opposition to the Anarchist Exclusion Act had given her an appreciation for reaching out to those of other political positions. When the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] sent spies to observe, they reported the meetings as \"packed\".<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 166.</ref> Writers, journalists, artists, judges, and workers from across the spectrum spoke of her \"magnetic power\", her \"convincing presence\", her \"force, eloquence, and fire\".<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 168.</ref>\n\n[[File:Emma Goldman as sketched by Marguerite Martyn, 1908.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman in 1908, sketched by [[Marguerite Martyn]]]]\n[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman joined [[Margaret Sanger]] in crusading for women's access to [[birth control]]; both women were arrested for violating the [[Comstock Law]].]]\n\nIn the spring of 1908, Goldman met and fell in love with [[Ben Reitman]], the so-called \"Hobo doctor.\" Having grown up in Chicago's Tenderloin District, Reitman spent several years as a drifter before earning a medical degree from the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine|College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago]]. As a doctor, he treated people suffering from poverty and illness, particularly [[venereal disease]]s. He and Goldman began an affair. They shared a commitment to [[free love]] and Reitman took a variety of lovers, but Goldman did not. She tried to reconcile her feelings of jealousy with a belief in freedom of the heart, but found it difficult.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 140\u2013147.</ref>\n\nTwo years later, Goldman began feeling frustrated with lecture audiences. She yearned to \"reach the few who really want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused\".<ref name=\"EGAn49\">Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 49.</ref> She collected a series of speeches and items she had written for ''Mother Earth'' and published a book titled ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]].'' Covering a wide variety of topics, Goldman tried to represent \"the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years\".<ref name=\"EGAn49\"/> In addition to a comprehensive look at anarchism and its criticisms, the book includes essays on patriotism, [[women's suffrage]], marriage, and prisons.\n\nWhen [[Margaret Sanger]], an advocate of access to [[contraception]], coined the term \"birth control\" and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine ''The Woman Rebel,'' she received aggressive support from Goldman. The latter had already been active in efforts to increase birth control access for several years. In 1916, Goldman was arrested for giving lessons in public on how to use contraceptives.<ref>Alice S. Rossi. ''The Feminist Papers: From Adams to de Beauvoir.'' Lebanon, New Hampshire: Northeastern University Press, 1988, p. 507</ref> Sanger, too, was arrested under the [[Comstock Law]], which prohibited the dissemination of \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious articles\",<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 210.</ref> which authorities defined as including information relating to birth control.\n\nAlthough they later split from Sanger over charges of insufficient support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger's pamphlet ''Family Limitation'' (along with a similar essay of Reitman's). In 1915 Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour, in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation's attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested on February 11, 1916, as she was about to give another public lecture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/feb11.html |title=Today in History: February 11 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}</ref> Goldman was charged with violating the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, Goldman spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an \"opportunity\" to reconnect with those rejected by society.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 211\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=== World War I ===\nAlthough US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was re-elected in 1916 under the slogan \"He kept us out of the war\", at the start of his second term, he announced that [[Germany]]'s continued deployment of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] was sufficient cause for the US to enter [[World War I|the Great War]]. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]], which required all males aged 21\u201330 to register for military [[conscription]]. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in [[militarism|militarist]] aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in ''Mother Earth'' her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose US involvement in the war.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 186\u2013187; Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 230.</ref>\n\n[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldman on a streetcar in 1917, perhaps during a strike or demonstration.]]\n\nTo this end, she and Berkman organized the [[No conscription league|No Conscription League]] of New York, which proclaimed: \"We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, antimilitarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments.\"<ref>Berkman, p. 155.</ref> The group became a vanguard for anti-draft activism, and chapters began to appear in other cities. When police began raiding the group's public events to find young men who had not registered for the draft, however, Goldman and others focused their efforts on distributing pamphlets and other writings.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 186\u2013187.</ref> In the midst of the nation's patriotic fervor, many elements of the political left refused to support the League's efforts. The Women's Peace Party, for example, ceased its opposition to the war once the US entered it. The [[Socialist Party of America]] took an official stance against US involvement, but supported Wilson in most of his activities.<ref>Chalberg, p. 129.</ref>\n\nOn June 15, 1917, Goldman and Berkman were arrested during a raid of their offices, in which authorities seized  \"a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda\".<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite news |title=Emma Goldman and A.

Defending herself and Berkman during their trial, Goldman invoked the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], asking how the government could claim to fight for democracy abroad while suppressing free speech at home:\n\n<blockquote>We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outraged, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged? Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? </blockquote><ref>''Trial and Speeches of Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman in the United States District Court, in the City of New York, July 1917'' (New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association, 1917)</ref>\n\nThe jury found Goldman and Berkman guilty. Judge [[Julius Marshuetz Mayer]] imposed the maximum sentence: two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine each, and the possibility of [[deportation]] after their release from prison. As she was transported to [[Missouri State Penitentiary]], Goldman wrote to a friend: \"Two years imprisonment for having made an uncompromising stand for one's ideal. Why that is a small price.\"<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 235\u2013244.</ref>\n\nIn prison, she was assigned to work as a seamstress, under the eye of a \"miserable gutter-snipe of a 21-year-old boy paid to get results\".<ref>Quoted in Chalberg, p. 141.</ref> She met the socialist [[Kate Richards O'Hare]], who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy\u2014 O'Hare believed in voting to achieve state power\u2014the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 141\u2013142.</ref> Goldman also met and became friends with [[Gabriella Segata Antolini]], an anarchist and follower of [[Luigi Galleani]]. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities, and was sent to prison for 14 months. Working together to make life better for the other inmates, the three women became known as \"The Trinity\". Goldman was released on September 27, 1919.<ref>Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 253\u2013263.</ref>\n\n=== Deportation ===\n[[File:Emma Goldman's deportation photo, 1919.jpg|thumb|Emma Goldman's deportation photo, 1919|upright]]\nGoldman and Berkman were released from prison during the United States' [[First Red Scare|Red Scare of 1919\u201320]], when public anxiety about wartime pro-German activities had expanded into a pervasive fear of Bolshevism and the prospect of an imminent radical revolution. It was a time of social unrest due to union organizing strikes and actions by activist immigrants. [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]], head of the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice's]] General Intelligence Division (now the FBI), were intent on using the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]] and its [[Immigration Act of 1918#Definition of anarchist|1918 expansion]] to deport any non-citizens they could identify as advocates of anarchy or revolution. \"Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman,\" Hoover wrote while they were in prison, \"are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and return to the community will result in undue harm.\"<ref>Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 215.</ref>\n\nAt her deportation hearing on October 27, Goldman refused to answer questions about her beliefs, on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: \"Today so-called [[Alien (law)|aliens]] are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished.

She wrote in ''Mother Earth'' that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented \"the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being\".<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 243.</ref> By the time she neared Europe, however, she expressed fears about what was to come. She was worried about the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]] and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. \"I could never in my life work within the confines of the State,\" she wrote to her niece, \"Bolshevist or otherwise.\"<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 17.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dissillusioncover.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman's experiences in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] led to her 1923 book, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''.]]\nShe quickly discovered that her fears were justified.

Those who questioned the government were demonized as [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]],<ref name=\"livingmylife\"/> and workers labored under severe conditions.<ref name=\"livingmylife\"/> They met with [[Vladimir Lenin]], who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. He told them: \"There can be no free speech in a revolutionary period.\"<ref>Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 235.</ref> Berkman was more willing to forgive the government's actions in the name of \"historical necessity\", but he eventually joined Goldman in opposing the Soviet state's authority.<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 236\u2013237.</ref>\n\nIn March 1921, strikes erupted in Petrograd when workers took to the streets demanding better food rations and more [[Trade union|union]] autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: \"To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal.\"<ref>Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 237.</ref> The unrest spread to the port town of [[Kronstadt]], where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. \"More and more\", she wrote, \"we have come to the conclusion that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave.\"<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 47\u201349.</ref>\n\nIn December 1921, they left the country and went to the Latvian capital city of [[Riga]]. The US commissioner in that city wired officials in Washington DC, who began requesting information from other governments about the couple's activities. After a short trip to [[Stockholm]], they moved to [[Berlin]] for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s newspaper, the ''[[New York World]].'' These were later collected and published in book form as ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'' (1923) and ''[[My Further Disillusionment in Russia]]'' (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, albeit in vain.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 56\u201358.</ref>\n\n=== England, Canada, and France ===\nGoldman found it difficult to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist [[Rebecca West]] arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], novelist [[H. G. Wells]], and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sacvan.jpg|thumb|The 1927 executions of Italian anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] (right) and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] were troubling for Goldman, then living alone in Canada.]]\n\nIn 1925, the spectre of deportation loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named [[James Colton]] offered to marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada.<ref>Falk, ''Love'', pp. 209\u2013210.</ref> Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: \"I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to come back here from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive.\"<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 111.</ref> She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were \"awful,\" and she never finished her second book on the subject.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 115.</ref>\n\nGoldman traveled to Canada in 1927, just in time to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the US. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in [[Boston]]; memories of the [[Haymarket affair]] overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. \"Then,\" she wrote, \"I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing.\"<ref>Quoted in Chalberg, p. 164.</ref><ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 122.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, she began writing her autobiography, with the support of a group of American admirers, including journalist [[H. L. Mencken]], poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], novelist [[Theodore Dreiser]] and art collector [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who raised $4,000 for her.<ref>Mary V. Dearborn, ''Mistress of Modernism: The Life of Peggy Guggenheim'', Houghton Mifflin, 2004, pp.61\u201362</ref> She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of [[Saint-Tropez]] and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 135.</ref> Goldman intended the book, ''[[Living My Life]],'' as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]], however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due in large part to the [[Great Depression]], sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US.<ref>Chalberg, pp. 165\u2013166.</ref> Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'' all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 154.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Goldman received permission to lecture in the United States under the condition that she speak only about drama and her autobiography\u2014but not current political events. She returned to New York on February 2, 1934 to generally positive press coverage\u2014except from Communist publications. Soon she was surrounded by admirers and friends, besieged with invitations to talks and interviews. Her visa expired in May, and she went to [[Toronto]] in order to file another request to visit the US. However, this second attempt was denied. She stayed in Canada, writing articles for US publications.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 158\u2013164.</ref>\n\nIn February and March 1936, Berkman underwent a pair of [[prostate gland]] operations. Recuperating in [[Nice]] and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in [[Saint-Tropez]] in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call in the middle of the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose [[paralysis]]. He died later that evening.<ref>Wexler, ''Emma Goldman in Exile'', pp. 193\u2013194.</ref><ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 298\u2013300.</ref>\n\n=== Spanish Civil War ===\nIn July 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] started after an attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by parts of the [[Spanish Army]] against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. At the same time, the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]], fighting against the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist forces]], started [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|an anarchist revolution]]. Goldman was invited to [[Barcelona]] and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, \"the crushing weight that was pressing down on my heart since Sasha's death left me as by magic\".<ref>Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 301\u2013302.</ref> She was welcomed by the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica]] (FAI) organizations, and for the first time in her life lived in a [[Revolutionary Catalonia|community run by and for anarchists]], according to true anarchist principles. \"In all my life\", she wrote later, \"I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity.\"<ref>Quoted in Wexler, p. 232.</ref> After touring a series of [[collectives]] in the province of [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]], she told a group of workers: \"Your revolution will destroy forever [the notion] that anarchism stands for chaos.\"<ref>Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 303.</ref> She began editing the weekly ''CNT-FAI Information Bulletin'' and responded to English-language mail.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n[[File:CNT FAI flag.png|thumb|left|Goldman edited the English-language ''Bulletin'' of the [[Anarcho-syndicalist]] organizations [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica]] (FAI) during the [[Spanish Civil War]].]]\n\nGoldman began to worry about the future of Spain's anarchism when the CNT-FAI joined a coalition government in 1937\u2014against the core anarchist principle of abstaining from state structures\u2014and, more distressingly, made repeated concessions to Communist forces in the name of uniting against fascism. She wrote that cooperating with Communists in Spain was \"a denial of our comrades in Stalin's concentration camps\".<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 209.</ref> Russia, meanwhile, refused to send weapons to anarchist forces, and disinformation campaigns were being waged against the anarchists across Europe and the US.

She wrote regularly for ''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Spain and the World]]'', a biweekly newspaper focusing on the civil war. In May 1937, however, Communist-led forces [[Barcelona May Days|attacked anarchist strongholds]] and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] at face value. British journalist [[George Orwell]], present for the crackdown, wrote: \"[T]he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May&nbsp;...&nbsp;beat everything I have ever seen for lying.\"<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 216.</ref>\n\nGoldman returned to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared to her like people \"in a burning house\".

Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten, however. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT-FAI, Mariano V\u00e1zquez, sent a message to her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as \"our spiritual mother\". She called it \"the most beautiful tribute I have ever received\".<ref>Both quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 232.</ref>\n\n=== Final years ===\n[[File:Emma-Goldman-Grave-Forest-Home-Cemetery-Il.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone of Emma Goldman, Forest Home Cemetery, Forest Park, IL|Goldman's grave in Illinois' [[German Waldheim Cemetery|Forest Home Cemetery]], near those of the anarchists executed for the [[Haymarket affair]]. The dates on the stone are incorrect.]]\n\nAs the events preceding [[World War II]] began to unfold in Europe, Goldman reiterated her opposition to wars waged by governments. \"[M]uch as I loathe [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\", she wrote to a friend, \"I would not support a war against them and for the democracies which, in the last analysis, are only Fascist in disguise.\"<ref name=\"WexEx236\">Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 236.</ref> She felt that Britain and France had missed their opportunity to oppose fascism, and that the coming war would only result in \"a new form of madness in the world\".<ref name=\"WexEx236\"/>\n\n=== Death ===\nOn Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman suffered a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed on her right side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak.

While she rejected [[orthodoxy]] and fundamentalist thinking, she was an important contributor to several fields of modern political philosophy. She was influenced by many diverse thinkers and writers, including [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Another philosopher who influenced Goldman was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In her autobiography, she wrote: \"Nietzsche was not a social theorist, but a poet, a rebel, and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocrats]].\"<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', 194.</ref>\n\n=== Anarchism ===\nAnarchism was central to Goldman's view of the world and she is today considered one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism. First drawn to it during the persecution of anarchists after the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]], she wrote and spoke regularly on behalf of anarchism. In the title essay of her book ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', she wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nAnarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.<ref>Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 62.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGoldman's anarchism was intensely personal. She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. \"I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct,\" she once wrote. \"I care if his spirit of today is correct.\"<ref name=\"WexInt92\">Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 92.</ref> Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. \"It seems to me that ''these'' are the new forms of life,\" she wrote, \"and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them.\"<ref name=\"WexInt92\"/>\n\nAt the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans. While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor. In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. \"I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things.\"<ref>Goldman, ''Living'', p. 56.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==== Tactical uses of violence ====\nGoldman, in her political youth, held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. Goldman at the time believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated [[propaganda of the deed]]\u2014''attentat'', or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner [[Alexander Berkman]]'s attempt to kill industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]], and even begged him to allow her to participate.<ref name=\"EGLiv88\">Goldman, ''Living'', p. 88.</ref> She believed that Frick's actions during the [[Homestead strike]] were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. \"Yes,\" she wrote later in her autobiography, \"the end in this case justified the means.\"<ref name=\"EGLiv88\"/> While she never gave explicit approval of [[Leon Czolgosz]]'s assassination of US President [[William McKinley]], she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in \"The Psychology of Political Violence\": \"the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning.\"<ref>Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 79.</ref>\n\nHer experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means. In the afterword to ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'', she wrote: \"There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another.... The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose....\"  In the same chapter, however, Goldman affirmed that \"Revolution is indeed a violent process,\" and noted that violence was the \"tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals...\"<ref>Goldman, ''Disillusionment'', pp. 260\u2013264.</ref>  Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first US edition of ''My Disillusionment in Russia'':\n\n<blockquote>The argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute. I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.</blockquote>\n\nGoldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that \"an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130928015428/http://ucblibrary3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Writings/Russia/preface1.html \"Preface to First Volume of American Edition\" for ''My Disillusionment in Russia''] (Emma Goldman Papers Project, University of California-Berkeley).</ref>\n\n=== Capitalism and labor ===\nGoldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. \"The only demand that property recognizes,\" she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', \"is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade.\"<ref name=\"EGAnar54\">Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 54.</ref> She also argued that [[criticism of capitalism|capitalism dehumanized workers]], \"turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron.\"<ref name=\"EGAnar54\"/>\n\nOriginally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row. In her autobiography, she wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nHe said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.<ref name=\"Goldman-Living-52\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nGoldman realized that smaller efforts for improvement such as higher wages and shorter hours could be part of a social revolution.\n\n=== The state \u2013 militarism, prison, voting, speech ===\nGoldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and \"direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code\".<ref name=\"WexInt91\">Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 91.</ref> She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country.<ref>Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 167.</ref> She disagreed with the movement for [[women's suffrage]], which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay \"Woman Suffrage\", she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: \"As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!\"<ref>Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 205.</ref> She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men, but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just. \"To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers.\"<ref>Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nGoldman was also a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the treatment of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay \"Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure\", she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] on prisons, and wrote: <blockquote>Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.<ref>Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 120.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGoldman was a committed [[war resister]], believing that wars were fought by the state on behalf of capitalists.  She was particularly opposed to the [[conscription|draft]], viewing it as one of the worst of the state's forms of coercion, and was one of the founders of the [[No-Conscription League]]\u2014for which she was ultimately arrested (1917), imprisoned and deported (1919).\n\nGoldman was routinely surveilled, arrested, and imprisoned for her speech and organizing activities in support of [[workers]] and various strikes, access to [[birth control]], and in [[opposition to World War I]].  As a result, she became active in the early 20th century free speech movement, seeing freedom of expression as a fundamental necessity for achieving social change.<ref name=\"Goldman-Living\">See generally ''Living My Life''.</ref><ref name=\"Stone-2004\">See Geoffrey R.

I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood.\"<ref>Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 94.</ref>\n\nA nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women concerning [[Birth control|contraception]]. Like many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of [[free love]], and a strong critic of marriage. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of [[Religious fanaticism|Puritanism]] and capitalism. She wrote: \"We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction.\"<ref>Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 224.</ref><ref>See generally Haaland; Goldman, \"The Traffic in Women\"; Goldman, \"On Love\".</ref>\n\nGoldman was also an outspoken critic of [[homophobia|prejudice against homosexuals]]. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katz|first=Jonathan Ned|title=Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.|year=1992|location=New York City|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=376\u2013380}}</ref> As German sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] wrote, \"she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.\"<ref name=\"hirschfeld\">Goldman, Emma (1923). \"Offener Brief an den Herausgeber der Jahrb\u00fccher \u00fcber Louise Michel\" with a preface by Magnus Hirschfeld. ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr sexuelle Zwischenstufen''. '''23''': 70. Translated from German by James Steakley. Goldman's original letter in English is not known to be extant.</ref> In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld, \"It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life.\"<ref name=\"hirschfeld\"/>\n\n=== Atheism ===\nA committed [[atheist]], Goldman viewed religion as another instrument of control and domination. Her essay \"The Philosophy of Atheism\" quoted Bakunin at length on the subject and added:\n\n<blockquote>\nConsciously or unconsciously, most theists see in gods and devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment.... The philosophy of Atheism expresses the expansion and growth of the human mind. The philosophy of [[theism]], if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Goldman|first= Emma|date=February 1916|title= The Philosophy of Atheism|journal= Mother Earth|volume= |issue= |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Atheism|accessdate= December 7, 2007|quote=}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn essays like \"The Hypocrisy of Puritanism\" and a speech entitled \"The Failure of Christianity\", Goldman made more than a few enemies among religious communities by attacking their moralistic attitudes and efforts to control human behavior. She blamed Christianity for \"the perpetuation of a slave society\", arguing that it dictated individuals' actions on Earth and offered poor people a false promise of a plentiful future in heaven.<ref>Goldman, [http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/goldman413.htm \"The Failure of Christianity\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512084543/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/goldman413.htm |date=May 12, 2008 }}.

Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist, but did not regard her as a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for instance, [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]].<ref>Marshall, pp. 396\u2013401.</ref>\n\n[[File:Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldman's image, often accompanying a popular paraphrase of her ideas\u2014\"If I can't dance, I don't want to be in your revolution\"\u2014has been reproduced on countless walls, garments, stickers, and posters as an icon of freedom.]]\n\nIn 1970, [[Dover Press]] reissued Goldman's biography, ''Living My Life'', and in 1972, feminist writer [[Alix Kates Shulman]] issued a collection of Goldman's writing and speeches, ''Red Emma Speaks''. These works brought Goldman's life and writings to a larger audience, and she was in particular lionized by the [[Second-wave feminism|women's movement]] of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from ''Living My Life'' about \"the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things\", recounting that she had been admonished \"that it did not behoove an agitator to dance\".<ref name=\"wexler1\" /> The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of Goldman's most famous quotations, even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: \"If I can't dance I don't want to be in your revolution.\"<ref>[[Alix Kates Shulman|Shulman, Alix Kates]]. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20051217133141/http://sunsite3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Features/dances_shulman.html Dances with Feminists]\".

The growth of [[feminism]] also initiated some reevaluation of Goldman's philosophical work, with scholars pointing out the significance of Goldman's contributions to anarchist thought in her time. Goldman's belief in the value of [[aesthetics]], for example, can be seen in the later influences of [[anarchism and the arts]]. Similarly, Goldman is now given credit for significantly influencing and broadening the scope of activism on issues of sexual liberty, reproductive rights, and freedom of expression.<ref>Marshall, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref>\n\nGoldman has been depicted in numerous works of fiction over the years, including [[Warren Beatty]]'s 1981 film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', in which she was portrayed by [[Maureen Stapleton]], who won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her performance.

Its name is [[Latin]] for 'little horse', a [[foal]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after [[Crux]]), spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the [[apparent magnitude|fourth magnitude]].\n\n==Notable features==\n[[Image:EquuleusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Equuleus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]\n\n===Stars===\n{{see|List of stars in Equuleus}}\nThe brightest star in Equuleus is [[Alpha Equulei]], traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3.9, 186 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means \"the section of the horse\".{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}}\n\nThere are few [[variable star]]s in Equuleus.  Only around 25 are known, most of which are faint. [[Gamma Equulei]] is an [[alpha CVn star]], ranging between magnitudes 4.58 and 4.77 over a period of around 12\u00bd minutes.<!-- not cited to Ridpath and Tirion 2001 --> It is a white star 115 light-years from Earth, and has an [[optical binary|optical companion]] of magnitude 6.1, [[6 Equulei]]. It is divisible in binoculars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}} [[R Equulei]] is a [[Mira variable]] that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 15.7 over nearly 261 days.\n\nEquuleus contains some [[double star]]s of interest.  \u03b3 Equ consists of a primary star with a magnitude around 4.7 (slightly variable) and a secondary star of magnitude 11.6, separated by 2 [[arcsecond]]s.  [[Epsilon Equulei]] is a triple star also designated 1 Equulei. The system, 197 light-years away, has a primary of magnitude 5.4 that is itself a binary star; its components are of magnitude 6.0 and 6.3 and have a period of 101 years. The secondary is of magnitude 7.4 and is visible in small telescopes. The components of the primary are becoming closer together and will not be divisible in amateur telescopes beginning in 2015.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}} [[Delta Equulei|\u03b4 Equ]] is a [[binary star]] with an orbital period of 5.7 years, which at one time was the shortest known orbital period for an optical binary.  The two components of the system are never more than 0.35 arcseconds apart.\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\nDue to its small size and its distance from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Equuleus contains no notable deep sky objects. Some very faint [[galaxy|galaxies]] between magnitudes 13 and 15 include [[NGC 7015]], [[NGC 7040]], [[NGC 7045]] and [[NGC 7046]].\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Pegasus and Equuleus (best currently available version - 2014).jpg|thumb|Seen in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]\nIn [[Greek mythology]], one myth associates Equuleus with the foal Celeris (meaning \"swiftness\" or \"speed\"), who was the offspring or brother of the winged horse [[Pegasus]]. Celeris was given to [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]] by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. Other myths say that Equuleus is the horse struck from [[Poseidon]]'s trident, during the contest between him and [[Athena]] when deciding which would be the superior. Because this section of stars rises before [[Pegasus]], it is often called Equus Primus, or the First Horse. Equuleus is also linked to the story of [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nCreated by [[Hipparchus]] and included by [[Ptolemy]], it abuts Pegasus; unlike the larger horse it is depicted as a horse's head alone.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}}\n<ref>Evans, James \"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy\" Oxford University Press, 1998.</ref>\n\n==Equivalents==\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that correspond to Equuleus are located within the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (\u5317\u65b9\u7384\u6b66, ''B\u011bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00e1n W\u01d4'').<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0605/ap060515.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) \u5929\u6587\u6559\u80b2\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7db2 2006 \u5e74 5 \u6708 15 \u65e5]</ref>\n\n==References==\n* Burnham, Robert (1978).

They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] the term \"[[Sacrament (Mormonism)|The Sacrament]]\" is used of the rite.\n\n====Mass====\n[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is used in the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]] (especially in the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]), by many Anglicans (especially those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship), and in some other forms of [[Western Christianity]].  At least in the Catholic Church, the Mass is a longer rite which always consists of two main parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist, in that order. The Liturgy of the Word consists mainly of readings from scripture (the Bible) and a [[homily]] preached by a priest or deacon and is essentially distinct and separate from the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which comprises the entirety of the Liturgy of the Eucharist, so the Eucharist itself is only about one half of the Mass. (It is also possible and permissible in the Latin Rite for a priest to consecrate and distribute the Eucharist outside the ritual structure of the Mass\u2014such an event is often called a communion service\u2014but it is much more common to celebrate a full Mass.) Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are \"Holy Mass\", \"the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord\", the \"Holy Sacrifice of the Mass\", and the \"Holy Mysteries\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=2006 |title=Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church | page=275 | publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana }}, and {{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=1997 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church | pages=1328\u201332 | isbn=978-1574551105 |url =http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Y.HTM }}</ref> The term ''mass'' derives from post-classical Latin ''missa'' \"dismissal\", found in the concluding phrase of the liturgy, \"[[Ite, missa est]]\".<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.

The consecration of the bread (known as the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]]) and wine represents the separation of Jesus' Body from his Blood at [[Calvary]]. However, since he has risen, the Church teaches that his Body and Blood can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion]]) says \"The Body of Christ\" when administering the Host and \"The Blood of Christ\" when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire.\n\n[[File:BentoXVI-51-11052007 (frag).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] celebrates a Mass.]]\nThe Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26\u201328|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22\u201324|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:19\u201320|NAB}}) and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul's]] {{bibleref2|1cor|11:23\u201325||1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;11:23\u201325}}) recount that in that context Jesus said of what to all appearances were bread and wine: \"This is my body \u2026 this is my blood.\" The Catholic understanding of these words, from the Patristic authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ's words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101210092453/http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/eucharist2.html \"Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Prophetic Foundations of the Eucharist\".

In his 1968 ''[[Credo of the People of God]]'', he reiterated that any theological explanation of the doctrine must hold to the twofold claim that, after the consecration, 1) Christ's body and blood are really present; and 2) bread and wine are really absent; and this presence and absence is ''real'' and not merely something in the mind of the believer.\n\nOn entering a church, [[Latin Church]] Catholics [[genuflect]] to the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] that holds the consecrated host in order to respectfully acknowledge the presence of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]], a presence signalled by a [[sanctuary lamp]] or [[votive candle]] kept burning close to such a tabernacle. (If there is no such burning light, it indicates that the tabernacle is empty of the special presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.)  Catholics will also often kneel or sit before the tabernacle, when the sanctuary light is lit, to pray directly to Jesus, materially present in the form of the Eucharist. Similarly, the consecrated Eucharistic host\u2014the unleavened bread\u2014is sometimes exposed on the altar, usually in an ornamental fixture called a [[Monstrance]], so that Catholics may pray or contemplate in the direct presence and in direct view of Jesus in the Eucharist; this is sometimes called \"exposition of the Blessed Sacrament\", and the prayer and contemplation in front of the exposed Eucharist are often called \"adoration of the Blessed Sacrament\" or just \"adoration\".  All of these practices stem from belief in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, which is an essential Article of Faith of the Catholic Church.\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\n[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy.]]\n{{Main|Divine Liturgy}}\nWithin [[Eastern Christianity]], the Eucharistic service is called the ''Divine Liturgy'' ([[Byzantine Rite]]) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the ''Liturgy of the Catechumens'' which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the [[Gospels]] and, often, a [[homily]]; the second is the ''Liturgy of the Faithful'' in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the ''[[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], '' literally: \"offering\" or \"carrying up\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1- + \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9}}). In the [[Rite of Constantinople]], two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to Saint [[John Chrysostom]], the other to [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil the Great]]. In the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]], a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil's is offered on the Sundays of [[Great Lent]], the eves of [[Christmas]] and [[Theophany]], [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Holy Saturday]], and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the Body and Blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSXu17g7BRwC&pg=PA90 |first=Steven |last=Runciman |title=The Great Church in Captivity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1968 |isbn=0521313104 |page=90}}</ref> The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], like the Latin Church, uses unleavened bread, whereas the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] utilizes leavened bread in their celebration.<ref>[https://www.orthodoxanswers.org/why-do-the-orthodox-use-leavened-bread-since-leaven-is-a-symbol-of-sin-is-not-christs-body-sinless/ Why do the Orthodox use leavened bread since leaven is a symbol of sin? Is not Christ\u2019s body sinless? ] - orthodoxanswers.org. Retrieved 26 August 2018.</ref>\n\nConventionally this change in the elements is understood to be accomplished at the ''[[Epiclesis]]'' (\"invocation\") by which the [[Holy Spirit]] is invoked and the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine as the true and genuine Body and Blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can be readily singled out.\n\n===Protestant===\n====Anglican====\n{{Main|Anglican eucharistic theology}}\nAnglican eucharistic theology is not merely [[Memorialism|memorialist]] (the belief that nothing special happens at the Lord's Supper other than devotional reflection on Christ's death). Editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] from 1559 onwards repeatedly refuse to define the Presence most often referred to as the spiritual food of the Most Precious Body and Blood.  The Words of Administration allowed for a Real Presence interpretation. Consecration effects a change, Christ is present objectively which does not depend on the faith of the recipient,  but the Church refused to define the 'how' (and still does) asking that the bread and wine 'be' the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ rather than 'become.'\n\nThe so-called 'Black Rubric' in the 1552 Prayer Book which allowed kneeling for communion but denied the real and essential presence of Christ in the elements was omitted in the 1559 edition. It was re-instated in the 1662 Book modified to deny any corporeal presence to suggest Christ was present in his natural Body. The bread and wine are held to be outward symbols of an inward and spiritual grace received by the faithful as the instruments of God's grace and Jesus' self-offering to the communicant.\n\nIn most parishes of the [[Anglican Communion]] the Eucharist is celebrated every Sunday, having replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service. The rites for the Eucharist are found in the various prayer books of the Anglican churches. Wine and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread is used. Daily celebrations are the norm in many [[cathedral]]s and parish churches sometimes offer one or more services of Holy Communion during the week. The nature of the liturgy varies according to the theological tradition of the priests, parishes, [[diocese]]s and regional churches.\n\n====Baptist groups====\n[[File:Communion Baptist.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|Serving of elements individually, to be taken in unison, is common among Baptists.]]\nThe bread and \"fruit of the vine\" indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the ''Lord's Supper''<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|26:26\u201329}}, {{bibleref|Mark|14:22\u201325}}, {{bibleref|Luke|22:19}}</ref> are interpreted by many [[Baptists]] as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, [[grape juice]], which they commonly refer to simply as \"the Cup\".<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book | first=J. R. | last=Graves | year=1928 | title=What is It to Eat and Drink Unworthily | publisher=Baptist Sunday School Committee | oclc=6323560}}</ref> The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ's breaking the bread and saying that it was his body. A [[saltine cracker|soda cracker]] is often used.\n\nMost Baptists consider the Communion to be primarily an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment.\n\nHowever, with the rise of [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], some Baptists have denied the Zwinglian doctrine of mere memorialism and have taken up a Reformed view of Communion.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Confessional Baptists believe in [[Eucharistic_theology#Pneumatic_presence|pneumatic presence]], which is expressed in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Baptist Confession]], specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7. This view is prevalent among [[Southern Baptists]], those in the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement within the some [[Independent Baptists]], [[Freewill Baptists]], and several individuals in other Baptist associations.\n\nCommunion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.\n\nSome Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the church before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. It is rare to find a Baptist church where The Lord's Supper is observed every Sunday; most observe monthly or quarterly, with some holding Communion only during a designated Communion service or following a worship service.  Adults and children in attendance, who have not made a profession of faith in Christ, are expected to not participate.\n\n====Lutheran====\n[[File:EucharistELCA.JPG|right|thumb|Table set for the Eucharist in an ELCA service]]\n{{Main|Eucharist in Lutheranism}}\n{{see also|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}\n[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] believe that the body and blood of Christ are \"truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms\" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in this [[Lutheran sacraments|sacrament]].<ref>[[Augsburg Confession]], Article 10</ref> The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the \"[[sacramental union]]\".

The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting<ref>Muller, G.

Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament as a means of grace.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.opc.org/OS/html/V6/4l.html|title=The Lord's Supper: How Often?|author=D.

Harking back to the [[regulative principle of worship]], the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Over the last half a century it is much more common in Presbyterian churches to have Holy Communion monthly or on a weekly basis. It is also becoming common to receive the elements by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it) Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nMost Reformed churches practice open communion\", i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament.\n\n====Methodist====\n[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|A United Methodist minister consecrating the elements]]\nThe ''Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists'' states that, \"[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|present]] with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour\".<ref name=\"Methcat\" /> Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in one of the fathers of the movement, [[Charles Wesley]], who wrote a Eucharistic hymn with the following stanza:<ref name=\"AbrahamWatson2013\"/>\n:We need not now go up to Heaven,\n:To bring the long sought Saviour down;\n:Thou art to all already given,\n:Thou dost e\u2019en now Thy banquet crown:\n:To every faithful soul appear,\n:And show Thy real presence here!<ref name=\"AbrahamWatson2013\">{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Watson|first2=David F.|title=Key United Methodist Beliefs|year=2013|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English |isbn=978-1426756610|pages=103\u201304|quote=Charles Wesley wrote a marvelous collection of hymns that offer an amazing vision of Christ's mysterious, yet real, presence in the bread and the wine.

Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist.\n\n[[John Wesley]], a founder of Methodism, said that it was the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as communion cups.<ref>[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product Communion Cups, 1000] from Broadman / Holman Church Supply.

Many non-denominational Christians hold to the Biblical [[autonomy]] of local churches and have no universal requirement among congregations.\n\nSome [[Churches of Christ]], among others, use [[grape juice]] and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.\n\n===Other Christian churches===\n\n====Syriac====\n{{Main|Holy Qurbana}}\n'''Holy Qurbana''' or '''Qurbana Qadisha, ''' the \"Holy Offering\" or \"Holy Sacrifice\", refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the [[East Syrian Rite|East Syrian]] and [[West Syrian Rite|West Syrian traditions]] of [[Syriac Christianity]].

The service includes the ordinance of [[footwashing]] and the Lord's Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. [[Open communion]] is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate.

Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the \"anointed\" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized \"[[other sheep]]\" of Christ's flock also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving everlasting life in Paradise restored on a \"New Earth\".<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \"emblems\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms denoting spiritual and sacred realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>\"Discerning What We Are \u2013 At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>\n\n====Latter-day Saints====\n{{main|Sacrament (LDS Church)}}\nIn [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the \"Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper\",<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book |first= B.

This ancient custom is still evident in the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], where the Mass is divided into two parts: the Mass of the Catechumens, and the Mass of the Faithful; and likewise in the [[ordinary form of the Roman Rite]], where the Mass is divided into the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. The [[Divine Liturgy]] of St. John Chrysostom, used in the [[Byzantine Rite]], still has a formula of dismissal of catechumens (not usually followed by any action) at this point. Likewise, the ordinary form of the Roman Rite permits{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} the dismissal of catechumens at the usual opportunity,{{Clarify|date=July 2018|reason=What is the \"usual opportunity\"?}} but makes this wholly optional; it is no longer essential to the rite.\n\nChurches such as the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Churches]] practice [[closed communion]] under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Church of the East]]) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the [[Holy See]] judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844]</ref> Some [[Protestant]] communities exclude non-members from Communion.\n\nThe [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) practices open communion, provided those who receive are baptized,<ref>[http://www.religionresourcesonline.org/different-types-of-religion/evangelical-lutheran.php Evangelical Lutheran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222431/http://www.religionresourcesonline.org/different-types-of-religion/evangelical-lutheran.php |date=7 July 2011 }}.

For alcoholics, but not generally, it allows the use of [[mustum]] (grape juice in which fermentation has begun but has been suspended without altering the nature of the juice), and it holds that \"since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons, this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite.\"<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1390] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616060732/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |date=16 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant.

In addition to, or in replacement of wine, some churches offer grape juice which has been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes; de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains), or water.<ref>Compare John Howard Spahr, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 I Smell the Cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921224625/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 |date=21 September 2008 }}, ''Christian Century'', 12 March 1974, pp. 257\u201359.</ref> Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in [[Baptist]] churches, the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], [[Churches of Christ]], [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)]] some [[Lutherans]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], the [[Christian Missionary Alliance]], and other American [[Nondenominational Christianity|independent]] Protestant churches.\n\n====Fear of transmission of diseases====\nRisk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup is low, to the point of being undetectable. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the [[common cold]], but a study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Risk of Infectious Disease Transmission from a Common Communion Cup |first=Lilia P. |last=Manangan |first2=Lynne M. |last2=Sehulster |first3=Linda |last3=Chiarello |first4=Dawn N. |last4=Simonds |first5=William R. |last5=Jarvis |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |date=October 1998 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=538\u201339 |url= http://www.ntnl.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/470-common-cup-cdc |doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70029-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pellerin | first1 = J. | last2 = Edmond | first2 = M.

This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the [[Church of England]].<ref>[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/archbishops.advise.against.sharing.chalice.during.swine.flu.pandemic/23882.htm Archbishops advise against sharing chalice during swine flu pandemic]</ref>\n\nSome fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or \"pillow packs\" (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not accepted in Catholic Church parishes, one such church provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to communicate to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.<ref>{{cite web| first= Sumathi |last=Reddy |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704415104576065982762908782 |title= Hands Off After Wafer Scare| publisher= Wall Street Journal| date=7 January 2011| accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n;Eucharistic theology\n* [[Eucharistic theology]], [[Eucharistic theologies summarised]]\n* [[Eucharistic miracle]]\n* [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]\n\n;Liturgical worship\n* [[Holy Qurbana|Eastern Rite]]\n* [[Mass (liturgy)|Western Rite]]\n* [[Canon of the Mass]]\n* [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Eucharistic Prayers]]\n* [[Mass of Paul VI|Second Vatican Council changes]]\n\n;Eucharistic practice\n* [[Closed communion]]\n* [[Communion under both kinds]]\n* [[First Communion]]\n* [[Fraction (religion)]]\n* [[Intinction]]\n* [[Open communion]]\n* [[Sacramental wine]]\n* [[Thanksgiving after Communion]]\n\n;Views of different churches\n* [[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n* [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)]]\n* [[Sacramental Union]] (Lutheran)\n* [[Transubstantiation]] (Catholicism)\n\n;Sacramental theology\n* [[Baptism]]\n* [[Sacrament]]\n\n;History\n* [[Origin of the Eucharist]] ([[The Last Supper]])\n* [[Marburg Colloquy]] (1529)\n* [[Sacramentarians]] ([[Protestant Reformation]] period, approx. 16th Century)\n* ''[[The Adoration of the Sacrament]]'' by Martin Luther (1523)\n* [[Confession Concerning Christ's Supper]] by Martin Luther (1528)\n* [[Ubiquitarians]] (1530 and 1540)\n* [[Receptionism]] (16th and 17th-century Anglicans)\n* [[Year of the Eucharist]] (2004\u20132005)\n* [[Host desecration]]\n\n;Others\n* [[Agape feast]]\n* [[Catholic social teaching]]\n* [[Catholic theology of the body]]\n* [[Perichoresis]]\n* [[Theophagy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n\n:Bouyer, Louis.

Even the [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|best]] articles should not be considered complete, as each new editor can offer new insights on how to enhance the content in it at any time.\n\n==Adding information to Wikipedia==\nWikipedia is here to provide summaries of accepted knowledge to the public, as described in [[WP:NOT]]; generally speaking, the more accepted knowledge it can provide (subject to certain defined [[WP:NOT|limitations]] on its scope), the better it is. Please [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] add content summarizing accepted knowledge to Wikipedia, either by creating new articles or adding to existing articles, and exercise particular caution when considering removing sourced content. However, it is Wikipedia policy that information in Wikipedia should be [[WP:V|verifiable]] and must not be [[WP:NOR|original research]]. You are invited to show that content is verifiable by referencing [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Unsourced content may be challenged and [[WP:BURDEN|removed]], because on Wikipedia a lack of content is better than misleading or false content\u2014Wikipedia's reputation as an encyclopedia depends on the content in articles being verifiable and reliable.  To avoid such challenges, the best practice is to provide an \"[[WP:IC|inline citation]]\" at the time the content is added (see: [[WP:Citing sources]] for instructions on how to do this, or ask for assistance on the article talk page).\n\nAlthough reliable sources are required, when developing articles on the basis of sources, [[WP:COPYPASTE|avoid copying]] or [[WP:PARAPHRASE|closely paraphrasing]] a copyrighted source.  Wikipedia respects others' copyright.  You should read the source, understand it, and then express what it says in your own words.\n\nAnother way editors can improve an article is by finding a source for existing unsourced content. This is especially true if you come across statements that are potentially controversial.  You do not need to be the person who added the content to add a source and citation for it.\n\n=={{anchor|Perfection is not required}} Wikipedia is a work in progress: perfection is not required==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links. Please do not move it out of the section heading, even though it disrupts edit summary generation (you can manually fix the edit summary before saving your changes). Please do not modify it, even if you modify the section title. It is always best to anchor an old section header that has been changed so that links to it won't be broken.

(This text: [[Template:Anchor comment]]) -->\n{{policy shortcut|WP:IMPERFECT|WP:PERFECTION|WP:NOTPERFECT}}\n\n''Perfection is not required'': [[WP:WIP|Wikipedia is a work in progress]]. Collaborative editing means that incomplete or poorly written first drafts can evolve over time into excellent articles. Even poor articles, if they can be improved, are welcome. For instance, one person may start an article with an overview of a subject or a few random facts.  Another may help standardize the article's formatting, or have additional facts and figures or a graphic to add.  Yet another may bring better [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#Due and undue weight|balance]] to the views represented in the article, and perform fact-checking and [[WP:CITE|sourcing]] to existing content. At any point during this process, the article may become disorganized or contain substandard writing.\n\n=== Neutrality in articles of living or recently deceased persons ===\n{{further|Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons}}\nAlthough ''perfection is not required'', extra care should be taken on articles that mention living persons. Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced\u2014whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable\u2014should either be verified immediately, with one or more reliable sources and presented in a [[WP:NPOV|neutral manner]] without [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]], or be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion.\n\n=={{Anchor|Try to fix problems: preserve information|Preserve content}} Try to fix problems==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Preserve appropriate content. As long as any facts or ideas would belong in an encyclopedia, they should be [[WP:5P|retained in Wikipedia]]. ''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia|Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.]]''\n\nLikewise, as long as any of the facts or ideas added to an article [[WP:ONUS|would belong]] in the \"finished\" article, they should be retained if they meet the three article content retention policies: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]] (which does not mean [[WP:YESPOV|no point of view]]), [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|Verifiability]] and  [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]].\n\nInstead of removing article content that is poorly presented, consider cleaning up the writing, formatting or sourcing on the spot, or [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup|tagging]] it as necessary. If you think an article needs to be rewritten or changed substantially, [[WP:BOLD|go ahead and do so]], but it is best to [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines#How to use article talk pages|leave a comment]] about why you made the changes on the article's talk page. The [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|editing process]] tends to guide articles through ever-higher [[WP:ASSESS|levels of quality]] over time. ''Great Wikipedia articles can come from a succession of editors' efforts.''\n\nInstead of removing content from an article, consider:\n* [[Paraphrase|Rephrasing]] or [[copy-edit]]ing to improve grammar or more accurately represent the sources\n* Correcting [[Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute|inaccuracies]], while keeping the rest of the content intact\n* [[WP:Merge|Merging]] or moving the content to a more relevant existing article, or [[WP:SS|splitting]] the content to [[Wikipedia:Your first article|an entirely new article]]\n* [[WP:YESPOV|Adding other points of views]] to the existing points of view to make the article more balanced\n* Requesting a citation by adding the {{tl|citation needed}} tag, or adding any other [[Template:Inline tags]] as appropriate\n* Doing a quick [[Template:Findsources|search for sources]] and adding a citation yourself\n* Adding [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup|appropriate cleanup tags]] to sections you cannot fix yourself\n* [[WP:DEADREF|Repair a dead link]] if a new [[URL]] for the page or an [[archive site|archive]] of the old one can be located\n* Merging the entire article into another article with the original article turned into a [[WP:redirect|redirect]] as described at [[Wikipedia:MERGETEXT|performing a merge]]\n* Fixing errors in [[wikitext]] code or formatting\n\nOtherwise, if you think the content could provide the seed of a new subarticle, or if you are just unsure about removing it from [[WP:5P|the project]] entirely, consider copying the information to the article's talk page for further discussion. If you think the content might find a better home elsewhere, consider moving the content to a talk page of any article you think might be more relevant, so that editors there can decide how it might be properly included in our encyclopedia.\n\n===Problems that may justify removal===\n{{Policy shortcut|WP:CANTFIX|WP:WONTWORK|WP:DON'T PRESERVE}}\n{{Anchor|REMOVE}}Several of our core policies discuss situations when it ''might'' be more appropriate to remove information from an article rather than preserve it. [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] discusses handling unsourced and contentious material; [[Wikipedia:No original research]] discusses the need to remove original research; [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] describes material that is fundamentally inappropriate for Wikipedia; and [[WP:UNDUE]] discusses how to balance material that gives undue weight to a particular viewpoint, which might include removal of trivia, tiny minority viewpoints, or material that cannot be supported with high-quality sources. Also, redundancy within an article should be kept to a minimum (excepting the [[WP:LEAD|lead]], which is meant to be a summary of the entire article, and so is intentionally duplicative).\n\nLibel, nonsense, and vandalism should be completely removed, as should material that [[Wikipedia:Copyright violations|violates copyright]] and material for which no reliable source that supports it has ever been [[Wikipedia:Published|published]].\n\nSpecial care needs to be taken with biographies of living people, especially when it comes to handling unsourced or poorly sourced claims about the subject. Editors working on such articles need to know and understand the extra restrictions that are laid out at [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living people]].\n\n==Talking and editing==\n{{policy shortcut|WP:EPTALK}}\n''[[Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages|Be bold in updating articles]], especially for minor changes and fixing problems''. Previous authors do not need to be consulted before making changes. [[WP:OWN|Nobody owns articles]]. If you see a problem that you can fix, do so. Discussion is called for, however, if you think the edit might be controversial or if someone indicates disagreement with your edit (either by reverting your edit and/or raising an issue on the talk page).  The [[Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle|\"BOLD, revert, discuss cycle\" (BRD)]] is often used when changes might be contentious.\n\nBoldness should not mean trying to impose edits against [[WP:CONSENSUS|existing consensus]] or in violation of core policies, such as [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|Verifiability]]. [[Wikipedia:Fait accompli|''Fait accompli'']] actions, where actions are justified by their having already been carried out, are inappropriate.\n\n===Be helpful: explain===\n{{policy shortcut|WP:UNRESPONSIVE}}\n''Be helpful: explain your changes''. When you edit an article, the more radical or controversial the change, the greater the need to explain it. Be sure to leave a comment about ''why'' you made the change.  Try to use an appropriate [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]]. For larger or more significant changes, the edit summary may not give you enough space to fully explain the edit; in this case, you may leave a note on the [[Wikipedia:Talk page|article's talk page]] as well. Remember too that notes on the talk page are more visible, make misunderstandings less likely and encourage discussion rather than [[WP:EW|edit warring]].\n\n===Be cautious with major changes: discuss===\n{{policy shortcut|WP:CAUTIOUS}}\n''Be cautious about making a major change to an article.'' Prevent [[WP:EW|edit warring]] by discussing such edits first on the article's talk page. One editor's idea of an improvement may be another editor's idea of a desecration. If you choose to be [[WP:BOLD|bold]], try to justify your change in detail on the article talk page, so as to avoid an edit war. Before making a major change, consider first creating a new draft on a [[Wikipedia:User_pages#SUB|subpage of your own user page]] and then link to it on the article's talk page so as to facilitate a new discussion.\n\n===But&nbsp;\u2013 Wikipedia is not a discussion forum===\n{{further|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought}}\nWhether you decide to edit very boldly or discuss carefully on the talk page first, please bear in mind that Wikipedia is not a discussion forum. Wikipedia can be a very energetic place, and it is best for the project as a whole if we concentrate our energies on improving articles rather than debating our personal ideas and beliefs. This is discussed further at [[Wikipedia:Etiquette]].\n\n==Edits to policies and guidelines==\n{{policy shortcut|WP:WPEDIT}}\n{{further|Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Content changes}}\n{{seealso|Wikipedia:Be bold#Wikipedia namespace|Wikipedia:Project namespace#Content}}\n\nPolicies and guidelines are supposed to state what most Wikipedians agree upon, and should be phrased to reflect the present consensus on a subject. In general, more caution should be exercised in editing policies and guidelines than in editing articles. Minor edits to existing pages, such as formatting changes, grammatical improvement and uncontentious clarification, may be made by any editor at any time. However, changes that would alter the substance of policy or guidelines should normally be announced on the appropriate talk page first. The change may be implemented if no objection is made to it or if discussion shows that there is consensus for the change. Major changes should also be publicized to the community in general, as should proposals for new policy pages (see also [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Proposals]]).\n\n==Editing and refactoring talk pages==\nFor guidance on how to edit talk pages see:\n* [[Wikipedia:Talk page]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Archiving talk pages]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia|Contributing to Wikipedia]]: how and where you can help Wikipedia\n* [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|Disruptive editing]]: how not to edit Wikipedia\n* [[Help:Edit conflict|Edit conflicts]]: how to deal with an edit conflict\n* [[Wikipedia:There is no deadline|There is no deadline]]: various points of view on what this lack of a deadline means\n* [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]\n\n{{Wikipedia principles}}\n{{Wikipedia policies and guidelines}}\n\n[[Category:Wikipedia conduct policies]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia editing]]\n\n[[ml:\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3f\u0d2a\u0d40\u0d21\u0d3f\u0d2f:\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d \u0d28\u0d2f\u0d02]]", "sha1": "dy4rqeyv2aszpjzd2bpg8gd1k0sec9u"}}, {"title": "Eclipse", "ns": "0", "id": "9770", "revision": {"id": "866471977", "parentid": "866471013", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T15:02:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kahtar", "id": "19297870"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Repair CS1 error(s), replaced: website=www. \u2192 website= (3)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses|Eclipse (disambiguation)|Total Eclipse (disambiguation)}}\n{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Totality during the 1999 solar eclipse.

This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].<ref>{{cite press release |author=Staff |date=March 31, 1981 |publisher=The New York Times |title=Science Watch: A Really Big Syzygy |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&fta=y |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210100651/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&fta=y |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |df= }}</ref> Apart from syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft reaches a position where it can observe two celestial bodies so aligned. An eclipse is the result of either an [[occultation]] (completely hidden) or a [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] (partially hidden).\n\nThe term eclipse is most often used to describe either a [[solar eclipse]], when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a [[lunar eclipse]], when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth\u2013Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A [[binary star]] system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.\n\nFor the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an \"[[eclipse season]]\", the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The [[Solar eclipse#Types|type of solar eclipse]] that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on [[apparent size]]s of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen each and every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. And if both orbits were perfectly circular, then each solar eclipse would be the same type every month. It is because of the non-planar and non-circular differences that eclipses are not a common event. Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly a total eclipse, as occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface, is a rare event that can span many decades from one to the next.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|\u00e9kleipsis}}''), which means \"the abandonment\", \"the downfall\", or \"the darkening of a heavenly body\", which is derived from the verb {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ekle\u00edp\u014d}}'') which means \"to abandon\", \"to darken\", or \"to cease to exist,\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&x=0&y=0  |accessdate=2009-09-24 |df= |title=Https://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp/?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&x=0&y=0 }}</ref> a combination of prefix {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba-}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek-}}''), from preposition {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek}}''), \"out,\" and of verb {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|le\u00edp\u014d}}''), \"to be absent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&do=dictionary&language_id_from=23&language_id_to=8&word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&t.x=55&t.y=16|title=Free online English Greek dictionary.

The latter object will block some amount of light being emitted by the former, creating a region of shadow around the axis of the line. Typically these objects are moving with respect to each other and their surroundings, so the resulting shadow will sweep through a region of space, only passing through any particular location in the region for a fixed interval of time.

During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable. This is because Earth's apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of Deimos crossing Mars, or Phobos entering Mars's penumbra.\n\nThe ''first contact'' occurs when the eclipsing object's disc first starts to impinge on the light source; ''second contact'' is when the disc moves completely within the light source; ''third contact'' when it starts to move out of the light; and ''fourth'' or ''last contact'' when it finally leaves the light source's disc entirely.\n\nFor spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (''L'') of the umbra's cone-shaped shadow is given by:\n\n:<math>L\\ =\\ \\frac{r \\cdot R_o}{R_s - R_o}</math>\n\nwhere ''R<sub>s</sub>'' is the radius of the star, ''R<sub>o</sub>'' is the occulting object's radius, and ''r'' is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For [[Earth]], on average ''L'' is equal to 1.384{{e|6}}&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]], which is much larger than the Moon's [[semimajor axis]] of 3.844{{e|5}}&nbsp;km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]].<ref>{{cite book \n|first=Robin M. |last=Green |date=1985 \n|title=Spherical Astronomy |publisher=Oxford University Press \n|isbn=978-0-521-31779-5 }}</ref> If the occulting object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be [[refraction|refracted]] into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earth&mdash;producing a faint, [[red|ruddy]] illumination of the Moon even at totality.\n\nOn Earth, the shadow cast during an eclipse moves very approximately at 1&nbsp;km per sec. This depends on the location of the shadow on the Earth and the angle in which it is moving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/speed-of-eclipse-shadow.53722/|title=Speed of eclipse shadow? - Sciforums|author=|date=|website=sciforums.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094757/http://www.sciforums.com/threads/speed-of-eclipse-shadow.53722/|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Eclipse cycles ==\n{{Main|Eclipse cycle}}\n\nAn [[eclipse cycle]] takes place when eclipses in a series are separated by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A particular instance is the [[saros (astronomy)|saros]], which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3&nbsp;days, or a little over 18 years.

Because the [[orbit of the Moon|orbital plane of the Moon]] is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the [[ecliptic]]), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the [[node (astronomy)|node]]s). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year (during an [[eclipse season]]), and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times.

The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.<ref>{{cite web\n |first       = R.\n |last        = Hipschman\n |title       = Solar Eclipse: Why Eclipses Happen\n |url         = http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why.html\n |accessdate  = 2008-12-01\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205073238/http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why.html\n |archivedate = 2008-12-05\n |df          = \n|date        = 2015-10-29\n }}</ref>\n[[File:Solar eclipse visualisation.svg|thumb|upright|Each icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the moon (not to scale)]]\nThe [[Magnitude of eclipse|eclipse magnitude]] is the fraction of the Sun's diameter that is covered by the Moon.

Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7&nbsp;minutes, 31&nbsp;seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250&nbsp;km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700&nbsp;km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth's surface.\n\n[[File:Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse.svg|thumb|300px|right|Geometry of a total solar eclipse (not to scale)]]\n\nDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun's when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an [[occultation]] while an annular solar eclipse is a [[Astronomical transit|transit]].\n\nWhen observed at points in space other than from the Earth's surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of [[Apollo 12]] observed the [[:File:Earth Eclipses Sun-ap12-s80-37406.jpg|Earth to eclipse the Sun]] in 1969 and when the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]] [[Space probe|probe]] observed [[:File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|Saturn to eclipse the Sun]] in 2006.\n\n===Lunar eclipse===\n{{main|Lunar eclipse}}\n[[Image:Eclipse lune.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The progression of a [[lunar eclipse]] from right to left.

This happens only during a [[full moon]], when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.<ref>{{cite web\n |author      = Staff\n |date        = January 6, 2006\n |url         = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/suneclipse.php\n |title       = Solar and Lunar Eclipses\n |publisher   = NOAA\n |accessdate  = 2007-05-02\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512191007/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/suneclipse.php\n |archivedate = May 12, 2007\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nThere are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth's penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth's [[umbra]]; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth's umbra.

The most striking involve [[Jupiter]], which has four large moons and a low [[axial tilt]], making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter's cloudtops.\n\nThe eclipses of the [[Galilean moon]]s by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. [[Ole R\u00f8mer]] deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath203/kmath203.htm\n |title       = Roemer's Hypothesis\n |publisher   = MathPages\n |accessdate  = 2007-01-12\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224015233/http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath203/kmath203.htm\n |archivedate = 2011-02-24\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nOn the other three [[gas giant]]s, eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet's orbit, due to their higher [[inclination]] between the orbits of the moon and the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of the planet. The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6\u00b0 to Saturn's equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27\u00b0. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn's orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7&nbsp;years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.\n\nThe timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's [[longitude]] upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as [[Greenwich]]), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15\u00b0 around the Earth's equator. This technique was used, for example, by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni D. Cassini]] in 1679 to re-map [[France]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |last        = Cassini\n |first       = Giovanni D.\n |authorlink  = Giovanni Domenico Cassini\n |title       = Monsieur Cassini His New and Exact Tables for the Eclipses of the First Satellite of Jupiter, Reduced to the Julian Stile, and Meridian of London\n |url         = http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/18/207-214/237\n |journal     = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]\n |date        = 1694\n |volume      = 18\n |issue       = 207\u2013214\n |pages       = 237\u2013256\n |accessdate  = 2007-04-30\n |doi         = 10.1098/rstl.1694.0048\n |jstor       = 102468\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130908162932/http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/18/207-214/237\n |archivedate = 2013-09-08\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n===Mars===\n{{main|Transit of Phobos from Mars}}\n[[Image:PIA05553.gif|right|thumbnail|[[Transit of Phobos from Mars]], as seen by the Mars ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity rover]]'' (10 March 2004).]]\nOn [[Mars]], only partial solar eclipses ([[Transit of Phobos from Mars|transits]]) are possible, because neither of its moons is large enough, at their respective orbital radii, to cover the Sun's disc as seen from the surface of the planet.

The movements of both stars lie on a common [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] in space. When this plane is very closely aligned with the location of an observer, the stars can be seen to pass in front of each other. The result is a type of extrinsic [[variable star]] system called an [[eclipsing binary]].\n\nThe maximum [[luminosity]] of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease. The luminosity returns to normal once the two stars are no longer in alignment.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Bruton \n |first=Dan \n |url=http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/ebstar/ebstar.html \n |title=Eclipsing binary stars \n |publisher=Midnightkite Solutions \n |accessdate=2007-05-01 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414144827/http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/ebstar/ebstar.html \n |archivedate=2007-04-14 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nThe first eclipsing binary star system to be discovered was [[Algol]], a star system in the constellation [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].

Thompson's versions of qed were notable as the first to implement [[regular expression]]s. Regular expressions are also implemented in ed, though their implementation is considerably less general than that in qed.\n\n[[Dennis M. Ritchie]] produced what [[Doug McIlroy]] later described as the \"definitive\" ed,<ref name=\"reader\">{{cite techreport |first1=M.

It does not report the current filename or line number, or even display the results of a change to the text, unless requested. Older versions (c. 1981) did not even ask for confirmation when a quit command was issued without the user saving changes.<ref name=\"norman\">{{cite journal |title=The truth about UNIX |author=Donald A.

As computer technology improved and these constraints were loosened, editors with more visual feedback became the norm.\n\nIn current practice, ed is rarely used interactively, but does find use in some [[shell script]]s. For interactive use, ed was subsumed by the [[sam (text editor)|sam]], [[vi]] and [[Emacs]] editors in the 1980s. ed can be found on virtually every version of Unix and [[Linux]] available, and as such is useful for people who have to work with multiple versions of Unix. On Unix-based operating systems, some utilities like [[SQL*Plus]] run ed as the editor if the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables are not defined.<ref>Administering SQL*Plus. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10839/admn_sqlpls.htm#UNXAR166 Accessed 7/23/2016.</ref> If something goes wrong, ed is sometimes the only editor available. This is often the only time when it is used interactively.\n\nThe ed commands are often imitated in other line-based editors. For example, [[edlin|EDLIN]] in early [[MS-DOS]] versions and [[32-bit]] versions of [[Windows NT]] has a somewhat similar syntax, and text editors in many [[MUD]]s ([[LPMud]] and descendants, for example) use ed-like syntax. These editors, however, are typically more limited in function.\n\n== Example ==\nHere is an example transcript of an ed session. For clarity, commands and text typed by the user are in normal face, and output from ed is '''emphasized'''.\n\n a\n ed is the standard Unix text editor.\n This is line number two.\n .\n 2i\n  &nbsp;\n .\n ,l\n '''ed is the standard Unix text editor.$'''\n '''$'''\n '''This is line number two.$'''\n 3s/two/three/\n ,l\n '''ed is the standard Unix text editor.$'''\n '''$'''\n '''This is line number three.$'''\n w text\n '''65'''\n q\n\nThe end result is a simple text file containing the following text:\n\n ed is the standard Unix text editor.\n  &nbsp;\n This is line number three.\n\nStarted with an empty file, the <code>a</code> command appends text (all ed commands are single letters). The command puts ed in ''insert mode'', inserting the characters that follow and is terminated by a single dot on a line. The two lines that are entered before the dot end up in the file buffer. The <code>2i</code> command also goes into insert mode, and will insert the entered text (a single empty line in our case) before line two. All commands may be prefixed by a line number to operate on that line.\n\nIn the line <code>,l</code>, the lowercase L stands for the list command. The command is prefixed by a range, in this case <code>,</code> which is a shortcut for <code>1,$</code>. A range is two line numbers separated by a comma (<code>$</code> means the last line). In return, ed lists all lines, from first to last. These lines are ended with dollar signs, so that white space at the end of lines is clearly visible.\n\nOnce the empty line is inserted in line 2, the line which reads \"This is line number two.\" is now actually the third line.

Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the full-screen [[MS-DOS Editor|edit]] command, and by [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]] in [[Microsoft Windows]], it continues to be included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems.\n\n==History==\nEdlin was created by [[Tim Paterson]] in two weeks in 1980, for [[Seattle Computer Products]]'s [[86-DOS]] (QDOS)<ref>[http://www.patersontech.com/dos/byte%E2%80%93history.aspx A Short History of MS-DOS]</ref> based on the [[CP/M]] line editor ''ED''.<ref>[http://www.shaels.net/index.php/cpm80-22-documents/using-cpm/8-ed-utility ED Utility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620002545/http://www.shaels.net/index.php/cpm80-22-documents/using-cpm/8-ed-utility |date=2013-06-20 }}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft acquired 86-DOS and sold it as MS-DOS, so Edlin was included in v1.0\u2013v5.0 of MS-DOS, after which the only editor included was the new full-screen [[MS-DOS Editor]] in v6.0\u2013v8.0. \n\nEarly Windows versions ran on top of the later versions of MS-DOS, so Edlin was typically not available. \n\nHowever, Edlin is included in the 32-bit versions of [[Windows NT]]<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/101929 16-Bit Applications Included with Windows NT], microsoft.com</ref> and its derivatives\u2014up to and including [[Windows 10]]\u2014because the [[Virtual DOS machine|NTVDM]]'s DOS support in those operating systems is based on MS-DOS version 5.0. However, unlike most other external DOS commands, it has not been transformed into a native [[Windows API|Win32]] program. It also does not support [[long filename]]s, which were not added to MS-DOS and MS-Windows until long after Edlin was written.\n\n==Usage==\nThere are only a few commands. The short list can be found by entering a ? at the edlin prompt.\n\nWhen a file is open, typing L lists the contents (e.g., <code>1,6L</code> lists lines 1 through 6). Each line is displayed with a line number in front of it.\n\n *1,6L\n        1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.\n        2:\n        3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages\n        4: branded with a logo at the bottom:\n        5: \"This page created in edlin.\"\n        6: The things that some people put themselves through. ;-)\n *\n\nThe currently selected line has a *.  To replace the contents of any line, the line number is entered and any text entered replaces the original.  While editing a line pressing Ctrl-C cancels any changes. The * marker remains on that line.\n\nEntering I (optionally preceded with a line number) inserts one or more lines before the * line or the line given.  When finished entering lines, Ctrl-C returns to the edlin command prompt.\n\n *6I\n        6:*(...or similar)\n        7:*^C \n &nbsp;\n *7D\n *L\n        1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.\n        2:\n        3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages\n        4: branded with a logo at the bottom:\n        5: \"This page created in edlin.\"\n        6: (...or similar)\n *\n\n:'''D''' - deletes the specified line, again optionally starting with the number of a line, or a range of lines.  E.g.: <code>2,4d</code> deletes lines 2 through 4.  In the above example, line 7 was deleted.  \n\n:'''R''' - is used to replace all occurrences of a piece of text in a given range of lines, for example, to replace a spelling error.  Including the ? prompts for each change.  E.g.: To replace 'prit' with 'print' and to prompt for each change: <code>?rprit^Zprint</code> (the ^Z represents pressing CTRL-Z).  It is case-sensitive.\n\n:'''S''' - searches for given text.  It is used in the same way as replace, but without the replacement text.  A search for 'apple' in the first 20 lines of a file is typed <code>1,20?sapple</code> (no space, unless that is part of the search) followed by a press of enter.  For each match, it asks if it is the correct one, and accepts n or y (or Enter).\n\n:'''P''' - displays a listing of a range of lines. If no range is specified, P displays the complete file from the * to the end. This is different from L in that P changes the current line to be the last line in the range.\n\n:'''T''' - transfers another file into the one being edited, with this syntax: [line to insert at]t[full path to file].\n\n:'''W''' - (write) saves the file.\n\n:'''E''' - saves the file and quits edlin.\n\n:'''Q''' - quits edlin without saving.\n\n===Scripts===\nEdlin may be used as a non-interactive file editor in scripts by [[Redirection (computing)|redirecting]] a series of edlin commands.\n\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nedlin < script\n</source>\n\n===FreeDOS Edlin===\nA [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]-licensed [[clone (computer science)|clone]] of Edlin that includes long filename support is available for download as part of the [[FreeDOS]] project.

Contrast at top enhanced to show the printed characters.]]\nEBCDIC was devised in 1963 and 1964 by [[IBM]] and was announced with the release of the [[IBM System/360]] line of mainframe [[computer]]s. It is an eight-bit character encoding, developed separately from the seven-bit [[ASCII]] encoding scheme. It was created to extend the existing [[Binary-coded decimal#IBM and BCD|Binary-Coded Decimal]] (BCD) Interchange Code, or [[BCDIC]], which itself was devised as an efficient means of encoding the two ''zone'' and ''number'' punches on [[punched cards]] into six bits. The distinct encoding of 's' and 'S' (using position 2 instead of 1) was maintained from [[punched cards]] where it was desirable not to have hole punches too close to each other to ensure the integrity of the physical card.\n\nWhile IBM was a chief proponent of the ASCII standardization committee,<ref name=\"WPS\"/> the company did not have time to prepare ASCII peripherals (such as card punch machines) to ship with its System/360 computers, so the company settled on EBCDIC.<ref name=\"Bemer_P-Bit\"/> The System/360 became wildly successful, together with clones such as [[RCA Spectra 70]], [[ICL System 4]], and Fujitsu FACOM, thus so did EBCDIC.\n\nAll IBM mainframe and [[Midrange computer|midrange]] [[peripheral]]s and [[operating system]]s use EBCDIC as their inherent encoding<ref name=\"ibmebcdic\"/> (with toleration for ASCII, for example, [[ISPF]] in [[z/OS]] can browse and edit both EBCDIC and ASCII encoded files). Software and many hardware peripherals can translate to and from encodings, and modern mainframes (such as IBM [[zSeries]]) include processor instructions, at the hardware level, to accelerate translation between character sets.\n\nThere is an EBCDIC-oriented [[Unicode Transformation Format]] called [[UTF-EBCDIC]] proposed by the Unicode consortium, designed to allow easy updating of EBCDIC software to handle Unicode, but not intended to be used in open interchange environments. Even on systems with extensive EBCDIC support, it has not been popular. For example, z/OS supports Unicode (preferring [[UTF-16]] specifically), but z/OS only has limited support for UTF-EBCDIC.\n\n[[IBM AIX]] running on the [[RS/6000]] and its descendants including the [[IBM Power Systems]], [[Linux on z Systems|Linux running on z Systems]], and operating systems running on the [[IBM PC]] and its descendants use ASCII, as did [[AIX/370]] and [[AIX/390]] running on [[System/370]] and [[System/390]] mainframes.\n\n== Compatibility with ASCII ==\nThe fact that all the code points were different was less of a problem for inter-operating with [[ASCII]] than the fact that sorting EBCDIC put lowercase letters before uppercase letters and letters before numbers, exactly the opposite of ASCII.\n\nSoftware portability and data exchange are hindered by EBCDIC's lack of codes for several symbols (such as the brace characters) commonly used in programming and in network communications.\n\nThe gaps between letters made simple code that worked in ASCII fail on EBCDIC. For example, \"<code>for&nbsp;(c='A';c<='Z';++c)</code>\" would set <code>c</code> to the 26 letters in the ASCII alphabet, but 41 characters including a number of unassigned ones in EBCDIC. Fixing this required complicating the code with function calls which was greatly resisted by programmers.\n\nAll ASCII codes stored within an eight-bit byte had nonnegative values on systems such as the [[PDP-11]] that treated bytes as signed quantities.  Software on those platforms often took advantage of that property, causing problems when it was ported to EBCDIC-based environments where many character codes had a 1 as the \"sign\" bit.\n\nBy using all eight bits EBCDIC may have encouraged the use of the eight-bit byte by IBM, while ASCII was more likely to be adopted by systems with 36 bits (as five seven-bit ASCII characters fit into one word). As eight-bit bytes became widespread, ASCII systems sometimes used the \"unused\" bit for other purposes such as [[parity bit|parity]], thus making it more difficult to transition to larger character sets.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Code page layout ==\n{{See|EBCDIC code pages}}\nThe table below shows the \"invariant subset\" of EBCDIC, which are characters that ''should'' have the same assignments on all EBCDIC code pages. It also shows (in boxes) missing ASCII and EBCDIC punctuation, located where then are in [[CCSID 037]] (one of the code page variants of EBCDIC). Unassigned codes are typically filled with international or region-specific characters in the various EBCDIC [[code page]] variants, but the characters in boxes are often moved around as well.\n\nIn each table cell below, the first row is an abbreviation for a control code or (for printable characters) the character itself; and the second row is the [[Unicode]] code (blank for controls that don't exist in Unicode).\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|EBCDIC}}\n|-\n!{{chset-left|0}}\n|{{chset-color-ctrl}}|{{chset-ctrl|0000|[[Null

The Jargon File 4.4.7 gives the following definition:<ref name=\"CATB\"/>\n{{quote|text = EBCDIC: /eb\u00b4s@\u00b7dik/, /eb\u00b4see`dik/, /eb\u00b4k@\u00b7dik/, n.\n[abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An alleged character set used on IBM dinosaurs. It exists in at least six mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies according to which version of EBCDIC you're looking at). IBM adapted EBCDIC from punched card code in the early 1960s and promulgated it as a customer-control tactic (see ''[[connector conspiracy]]''), spurning the already established ASCII standard. Today, IBM claims to be an [[open system (computing)|open-system]]s company, but IBM's own description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading. Hackers blanch at the very ''name'' of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of purest evil. \n|source=The Jargon file 4.4.7}}<!-- Public domain: [http://catb.org/jargon/quoting.html] -->\n\nEBCDIC design was also the source of many jokes.

In the \"Machine Room\" in ''[[Zork II]]'', EBCDIC is used to imply an incomprehensible language:\n{{quote|text = This is a large room full of assorted heavy machinery, whirring noisily. The room smells of burned resistors. Along one wall are three buttons which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square. Naturally, above these buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC...}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of EBCDIC code pages with Latin-1 character set]]\n* [[EBCDIC 037|Code page 037 (English, Portuguese)]]\n* [[EBCDIC 285|Code page 285 (Ireland, United Kingdom)]]\n* [[UTF-EBCDIC]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\">{{cite book |title=Coded Character Sets, History and Development |work=The Systems Programming Series |author-last=Mackenzie |author-first=Charles E. |year=1980 |edition=1 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.]] |isbn=0-201-14460-3 |lccn=77-90165 |id={{ISBN|978-0-201-14460-4}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-tQAAAAMAAJ |access-date=2016-05-22}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20160526172151/https://textfiles.meulie.net/bitsaved/Books/Mackenzie_CodedCharSets.pdf]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bemer_P-Bit\">{{cite web |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Bob |author-link=Bob Bemer |title=EBCDIC and the P-Bit (The Biggest Computer Goof Ever) - Computer History Vignettes |url=http://www.bobbemer.com/P-BIT.HTM |access-date=2013-07-02 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513204153/http://www.bobbemer.com/P-BIT.HTM |archive-date=2018-05-13 |quote=[\u2026] but their printers and punches were not ready to handle ASCII, and IBM just HAD to announce.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"WPS\">{{cite web |url=http://worldpowersystems.com/archives/codes/X3.4-1963/page4.JPG |title=X3.4-1963 |page=4 |date=1963 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812085410/http://worldpowersystems.com/projects/codes/X3.4-1963/page4.JPG |archive-date=2016-08-12}} (NB.

The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer [[nuclear membrane]]. The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from [[red blood cell]]s and [[spermatozoa]]. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough (granular) and smooth (agranular). The outer ([[cytosol]]ic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with [[ribosome]]s that are the sites of [[protein synthesis]]. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as [[hepatocyte]]s. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in [[lipid]] manufacture and metabolism, the production of [[steroid hormone]]s, and [[detoxification]].<ref name=\"bscb\">{{cite web|title=Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth)|url=http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/endoplasmic-reticulum-rough-and-smooth/|accessdate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124032610/http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/endoplasmic-reticulum-rough-and-smooth/|archivedate=24 November 2015|df=}}</ref> The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian [[liver]] and [[gonad]] cells.\n\n==History==\nThe ER was observed with [[light microscope]] by Garnier in 1897, who coined the term \"ergastoplasm\".<ref>Garnier, C. 1897.

These sac-like structures are held together by the [[cytoskeleton]]. The [[phospholipid membrane]] encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the [[perinuclear space]] but separate from the [[cytosol]]. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function.  The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell.  Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes.  Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.<ref name=\"Alberts_2002\">{{cite book | last1 = Alberts | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Lewis | first3 = Julian | last4 = Raff | first4 = Martin | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Keith | last6 = Walter | first6 = Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular biology of the cell | date = 2002 | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | isbn = 0-8153-3218-1 | edition = 4th | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26841/ | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171003052046/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26841/ | archivedate = 2017-10-03 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Geoffrey M.|name-list-format=vanc|title=The cell: a molecular approach|date=2000|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington (DC)|isbn=0-87893-106-6|edition=2nd|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9839/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311010402/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9839/|archivedate=2014-03-11|df=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Rough endoplasmic reticulum===\n[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px|An\n animation showing how a protein destined for the [[secretory pathway]] is synthesized into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (which appears at upper right in animation when approximately half of animation is done).

Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s and moved along the [[cytoskeleton]] toward their destination.

Japanese Americans in Hawaii were not incarcerated in the same way, despite the attack on Pearl Harbor. Although the Japanese American population in Hawaii was nearly 40% of the population of Hawaii itself, only a few thousand people were detained there, supporting the eventual finding that their mass removal on the West Coast was motivated by reasons other than \"military necessity.\"<ref name=Calisphere />\n\nJapanese Americans and other Asians in the U.S. had suffered for decades from prejudice and [[Yellow Peril|racially-motivated fear]]. Laws preventing Asian Americans from [[Alien land laws|owning land]], voting, [[People v. Hall|testifying against whites in court]], and other racially discriminatory laws existed long before World War II. Additionally, the [[FBI]], [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] and [[Military Intelligence Division]] had been conducting surveillance on Japanese American communities in Hawaii and the U.S. mainland from the early 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kashima |first=Tetsuden |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Custodial_detention_/_A-B-C_list/ |title=Custodial detention / A-B-C list |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> In early 1941, President Roosevelt secretly commissioned a study to assess the possibility that Japanese Americans would pose a threat to U.S. security. The report, submitted exactly one month before Pearl Harbor was bombed, found that, \"There will be no armed uprising of Japanese\" in the United States. \"For the most part,\" the [[Munson Report]] said, \"the local Japanese are loyal to the United States or, at worst, hope that by remaining quiet they can avoid concentration camps or irresponsible mobs.\"<ref name=Calisphere /> A second investigation started in 1940, written by Naval Intelligence officer Kenneth Ringle and submitted in January 1942, likewise found no evidence of [[fifth column]] activity and urged against mass incarceration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Brian |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Kenneth%20Ringle/ |title=Kenneth Ringle |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> Both were ignored.\n\nOver two-thirds of the people of Japanese ethnicity were incarcerated\u2014almost 70,000\u2014were American citizens. Many of the rest had lived in the country between 20 and 40 years. Most Japanese Americans, particularly the first generation born in the United States (the ''[[nisei]]''), considered themselves loyal to the United States of America. No Japanese American citizen or Japanese national residing in the United States was ever found guilty of sabotage or espionage.<ref name=\"Calisphere\">{{cite web |url=http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/jarda/historical-context.html |title=Relocation and Incarceration of Japanese Americans During World War II |publisher=University of California \u2013 Japanese American Relocation Digital Archives |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAmericans of Italian and German ancestry were also targeted by these restrictions, including internment. 11,000 people of [[Germans|German ancestry]] were interned, as were 3,000 people of [[Italians|Italian ancestry]], along with some [[Jews|Jewish]] refugees. The interned Jewish refugees came from Germany, as the U.S. government did not differentiate between ethnic Jews and ethnic Germans (the term \"Jewish\" was defined as a religious practice, not an ethnicity). Some of the internees of European descent were interned only briefly, while others were held for several years beyond the end of the war. Like the Japanese American incarcerees, these smaller groups had American-born citizens in their numbers, especially among the children. A few members of ethnicities of other Axis countries were interned, but exact numbers are unknown.\n\n==World War II camps under Executive Order 9066==\n\nSecretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] was responsible for assisting relocated people with transport, food, shelter, and other accommodations and delegated Colonel Karl Bendetsen to administer the removal of West Coast Japanese.<ref name=\"EO 9066\" /> Over the spring of 1942, Bendetsen issued [[Western Defense Command]] orders for Japanese Americans to present themselves for removal. The \"evacuees\" were taken first to temporary [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly centers]], requisitioned fairgrounds and horse racing tracks where living quarters were often converted livestock stalls. As construction on the more permanent and isolated WRA camps was completed, the population was transferred by truck or train. These accommodations consisted of tar paper-walled frame buildings in parts of the country with bitter winters and often hot summers. The camps were guarded by armed soldiers and fenced with barbed wire (security measures not shown in published photographs of the camps). Camps held up to 18,000 people, and were small cities, with medical care, food, and education provided by the government. Adults were offered \"camp jobs\" with wages of $12 to $19 per month, and many camp services such as medical care and education were provided by the camp inmates themselves.<ref name=\"Calisphere\"/>\n\n==Post-World War II==\n\nIn December 1944, President Roosevelt suspended Executive Order 9066.  Incarcerees were released, often to resettlement facilities and temporary housing, and the camps were shut down by 1946.<ref name=Calisphere />\n\nIn the years after the war, the interned Japanese Americans had to rebuild their lives. United States citizens and long-time residents who had been incarcerated lost their personal liberties; many also lost their homes, businesses, property, and savings. Individuals born in Japan were not allowed to become naturalized US citizens until 1952.<ref name=Calisphere />\n\nU. S. President [[Gerald Ford]] rescinded Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1976.<ref>[http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/760111p.htm President Gerald R. Ford's Proclamation 4417].</ref> In 1980, U. S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed legislation to create the [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]] (CWRIC). The CWRIC was appointed to conduct an official governmental study of Executive Order 9066, related wartime orders, and their impact on Japanese Americans in the West and [[Alaska Natives]] in the [[Pribilof Islands]].\n\nIn December 1982, the CWRIC issued its findings in ''Personal Justice Denied'', concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. The report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on \"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\". The Commission recommended legislative remedies consisting of an official [[Federal Government of the United States|Government]] apology and redress payments of $20,000 to each of the survivors; a public education fund was set up to help ensure that this would not happen again ({{USPL|100|383}}).\nOn August 10, 1988, the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], based on the CWRIC recommendations, was signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan]]. On November 21, 1989, [[George H. W. Bush]] signed an appropriation bill authorizing payments to be paid out between 1990 and 1998. In 1990, surviving internees began to receive individual [[reparation (legal)|redress payments]] and a letter of apology. This bill applied to the Japanese Americans and to members of the Aleut people inhabiting the strategic [[Aleutian islands]] in Alaska who were also relocated.<ref name=\"Civil Liberties Act\">{{cite web | url=http://digital.lib.usu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/Topaz/id/6370 | title=Public Law 100-383 \u2013 The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 | publisher=Topaz Japanese-American Relocation Center Digital Collection | date=August 10, 1988 | accessdate=April 25, 2014 | author=US Government}}</ref>\n\nThe anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 is now the [[Day of Remembrance (Japanese Americans)|Day of Remembrance]], an annual commemoration of the unjust incarceration of the Japanese American community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbpost.com/news/1309300152-day-of-remembrance-for-japanese-americans-interned-during-wwii|title=Day of Remembrance for Japanese-Americans Interned During WWII|first=|last=|publisher=Long Beach Post}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Executive Order 9102]]\n*[[War Relocation Authority]]\n*''[[Hirabayashi v.

His best known work is ''[[The Scream]]'', painted in 1893.\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEdvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of [[\u00c5dalsbruk]] in [[L\u00f8ten]], [[Union between Sweden and Norway|United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway]], to Laura Catherine Bj\u00f8lstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Laura was artistically talented and may have encouraged Edvard and Sophie. Edvard was related to painter [[Jacob Munch]] and to historian [[Peter Andreas Munch]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=15}}</ref>\n\nThe family moved to Christiania (renamed Kristiania in 1877, and now [[Oslo]]) in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at [[Akershus Fortress]]. Edvard's mother died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1868, as did Munch's favorite sister Johanne Sophie in 1877.<ref name=Eg_p16>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=16}}</ref> After their mother's death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=17}}</ref>\n\nAs Edvard remembered it, Christian's positive behavior toward his children was overshadowed by his morbid [[pietism]]. Munch wrote, \"My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious\u2014to the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=2}}</ref> Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=19}}</ref> One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding. Munch would later write, \"I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies\u2014the heritage of consumption and insanity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=137}}</ref>\n\nChristian Munch's military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty.<ref name=Eg_p16/> They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munch's early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munch's interests.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=22}}</ref> At thirteen, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Studies and influences===\n[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm'', 1895]]\nIn 1879, Munch enrolled in a [[Institute of technology|technical college]] to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and math. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies.<ref name=Pr_p35>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=35}}</ref> The following year, much to his father's disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an \"unholy trade\", and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=40}}</ref> In contrast to his father's rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art. He wrote his goal in his diary: \"in my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself.\"<ref name=Pr_p35/>\n\nIn 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were sculptor [[Julius Middelthun]] and the [[Naturalism (painting)|naturalistic]] painter [[Christian Krohg]].<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=41}}</ref> That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the Academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=34}}</ref> His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic's dismissive response: \"It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art.\"<ref name=Pr_p34>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=34}}</ref> Munch's nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for ''Standing Nude'' (1887). They may have been confiscated by his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=41}}</ref>\n\nDuring these early years, Munch experimented with many styles, including [[Naturalism (painting)|Naturalism]] and [[Impressionism]]. Some early works are reminiscent of [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]]. Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses.<ref name=Pr_p34/> At one point, however, Munch's father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch's cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=43}}</ref>\n\nMunch also received his father's ire for his relationship with [[Hans J\u00e6ger]], the local nihilist who lived by the code \"a passion to destroy is also a creative passion\" and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|pp=71, 74}}</ref> Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. \"My ideas developed under the influence of the [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] or rather under Hans J\u00e6ger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of [[Strindberg]] and the Germans\u2026but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=71}}</ref> At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called ''The City of Free Love''.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=72}}</ref> Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munch's relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life.\n\nAfter numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under J\u00e6ger's commandment that Munch should \"write his life\", meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his \"soul's diary\".<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=83}}</ref> This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting ''[[The Sick Child]]'' (1886), based on his sister's death, was his first \"soul painting\", his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another \"violent outburst of moral indignation\" from the community.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=88}}</ref>\n\nOnly his friend Christian Krohg defended him:\n<blockquote>He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule \"not complete\", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=52\u201353}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMunch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=46}}</ref> His idiom continued to veer between [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]], as seen in ''Portrait of Hans J\u00e6ger'', and [[Impressionism|impressionistic]], as in ''Rue Lafayette''. His ''[[Inger On the Beach]]'' (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=59}}</ref> He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]], what evolved was a subject matter which was [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=55}}</ref>\n\nMunch seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that it \"will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!\"<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Patricia G.|editor-last=Berman |date=1986 |title=Edvard Munch: Mirror Reflections |location=West Palm Beach, FL |publisher=Norton Gallery & School of Art |page=106 |oclc=757178143}}</ref>\n\nMunch's younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior ''Melancholy: Laura''.

Considered by the artist and journalist [[Christian Krohg]] as the first [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painting by a Norwegian artist, ''Melancholy'' was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo.<ref name=\"Eggum75\">{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=75}}</ref> In 1892, [[Adelsteen Normann]], on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition,<ref name=\"Pr_135\">{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|pp=135\u2013137}}</ref> the society's first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed \"The Munch Affair\"), and after one week the exhibition closed.<ref name=\"Pr_135\"/> Munch was pleased with the \"great commotion\", and wrote in a letter: \"Never have I had such an amusing time\u2014it's incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual [[August Strindberg]], whom he painted in 1892.  He also met Danish writer and painter [[Holger Drachmann]], whom he painted in 1898. Drachmann was 17 years Munch's senior and a drinking companion at [[Zum schwarzen Ferkel]] in 1893\u201394.<ref>{{harvnb|Munch|2005|p=119}}</ref>  In 1894 Drachmann wrote of Munch: \"He struggles hard.  Good luck with your struggles, lonely Norwegian.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Munch|2005|p=7}}</ref>\n\nDuring his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would comprise his major work, ''The Frieze of Life'', first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=77}}</ref> He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=153}}</ref> Already, Munch was showing a reluctance to part with his paintings, which he termed his \"children\".\n\nHis other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=79}}</ref> Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in ''Ashes'', the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munch's figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage (''Death in the Sick-Room''), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in ''The Scream'', Munch's men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. He wrote, \"No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.\"<ref name=Eg_p10>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=10}}</ref>\n\n===''The Scream''===\n{{Main article|The Scream}}\n[[File:Edvard Munch, 1893, The Scream, oil, tempera and pastel on cardboard, 91 x 73 cm, National Gallery of Norway.jpg|thumb|''[[The Scream]]'' (1893)]]\n''The Scream'' exists in four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910).

The 1910 painting was stolen in 2004 from The Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage.\n\n''The Scream'' is Munch's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.<ref name=Eg_p10/> Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis.\n\nWith this painting, Munch met his stated goal of \"the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self\".<ref>{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=16}}</ref> Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: \"I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=17}}</ref> He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, \"for several years I was almost mad\u2026 You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit\u2014nature was screaming in my blood\u2026 After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=152}}</ref>\n\nIn summing up the painting's effects, author Martha Tedeschi has stated:\n<blockquote>''[[Whistler's Mother]]'', Wood's ''[[American Gothic]]'', Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and Edvard Munch's ''The Scream'' have all achieved something that most paintings\u2014regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value\u2014have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.<ref>{{cite book|title=Whistler's Mother: An American Icon|year=2003|publisher=Lund Humphries|location=Burlington, VT|isbn=0-85331-856-5|editor-last=MacDonald|editor-first=Margaret F.|page=80}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Frieze of Life\u2014A Poem about Life, Love and Death''===\nIn December 1893, [[Unter den Linden]] in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munch's work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled ''Study for a Series: Love.'' This began a cycle he later called the ''Frieze of Life\u2014A Poem about Life, Love and Death''. ''Frieze of Life'' motifs, such as ''The Storm'' and ''Moonlight'', are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as ''Rose and Amelie'' and ''Vampire''. In ''Death in the Sickroom'', the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding ''Anxiety'', ''Ashes'', ''[[Madonna (Edvard Munch)|Madonna]]'' and ''Women in Three Stages'' (from innocence to old age).<ref>{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=28}}</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the \"Frieze\". He painted a number of pictures, several of them in bigger format and to some extent featuring the [[Art Nouveau]] aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting ''Metabolism'' (1898), initially called ''Adam and Eve''. This work reveals Munch's preoccupation with the \"fall of man\" and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as ''The Empty Cross'' and ''Golgotha'' (both {{circa|1900}}) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch's pietistic upbringing. The entire ''Frieze'' was shown for the first time at the [[Berlin Secession|secessionist]] exhibition in Berlin in 1902.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=211}}</ref>\n\n\"The Frieze of Life\" themes recur throughout Munch's work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=116\u2013118}}</ref> These themes are expressed in paintings such as ''[[The Sick Child]]'' (1885), ''Love and Pain'' (retitled ''Vampire''; 1893\u201394), ''Ashes'' (1894), and ''The Bridge''. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see ''[[Puberty (Edvard Munch)|Puberty]]'' and ''Love and Pain'') or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see ''Separation'', ''Jealousy'', and ''Ashes'').\n\nMunch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=122}}</ref> These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist's sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence.<ref>{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=6}}</ref> Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as ''Madonna'', ''Hands'' and ''Puberty'', and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series.<ref name=Fa_p5>{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=5}}</ref> Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, \"My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life\u2014it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=118}}</ref>\n\nWhile attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, \"With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=121}}</ref> One of his great supporters in Berlin was [[Walther Rathenau]], later the German [[foreign minister]], who strongly contributed to his success.\n\n===Paris, Berlin and Kristiania===\n[[File:Edvard Munch - The sick child (1907) - Tate Modern.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Sick Child]]'' (1907)]]\nIn 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his ''Frieze of Life'' themes. He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch's ''Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by [[Paul Klee]].<ref name=Eg_p141>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=141}}</ref> Munch also produced multi-colored versions of ''The Sick Child'', [[Tuberculosis in human culture|concerning tuberculosis]], which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of ''Kiss'' (1892).<ref name=Eg_p141/> Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch's work \"violent and brutal\" but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=152}}</ref> His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of [[\u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand]] in Norway. He dubbed this home the \"Happy House\" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years.<ref name=Eg_p153/> It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. \"To walk in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand is like walking among my paintings\u2014I get so inspired to paint when I am here\".\n\n[[File:Aase and Harald N\u00f8rregaard.jpeg|thumb|[[Harald N\u00f8rregaard]] (painted by Munch in 1899, [[National Gallery (Norway)|National Gallery]]) was one of Munch's closest friends since adolescence, adviser and lawyer<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Jens Thiis |first=Jens |last=Thiis |title=Edvard Munch og hans samtid.

They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in \"The Frieze of Life\" series, ''The Dance of Life'' (1899).<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=168}}</ref> Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: \"Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.\"<ref name=Eg_p174>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=174}}</ref> Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin.<ref name=Eg_p174/> His ''Girls on the Jetty'', created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations.<ref name=Fa_p5/> In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing \"a symphonic effect\u2014it made a great stir\u2014a lot of antagonism\u2014and a lot of approval.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=176}}</ref> The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.\n\nThe good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and [[Max Linde]]. He described the turn of events in his diary, \"After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany\u2014and a bright door opens up for me.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=181}}</ref> However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=183}}</ref> His paintings ''Still Life (The Murderess)'' and ''The Death of Marat I'', done in 1906\u201307, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=214}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903\u201304, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=190}}</ref> After studying the sculpture of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=195}}</ref> During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=196, 203}}</ref> In 1906, he painted the screen for an [[Ibsen]] play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]], in which the ''Frieze of Life'' was hung.

Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons\u2014honest portrayals devoid of flattery.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=240}}</ref> He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style\u2014broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black\u2014with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=259}}</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, \"All my friends are German but it is France that I love.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=285}}</ref> In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=288}}</ref> Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=290}}</ref> Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the [[Spanish flu]], the worldwide pandemic of that year.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=299}}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Munch grave 2.JPG|thumb|Munch's grave at the [[Cemetery of Our Saviour]], Oslo]]\nMunch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at [[Sk\u00f8yen]], Oslo.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=291}}</ref> Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse \"Rousseau\" as a model.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=292}}</ref> Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Nazis]] labeled Munch's work \"[[degenerate art]]\" (along with that of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and many other modern artists) and removed his 82 works from German museums.<ref>{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=287}}</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] announced in 1937, \"For all we care, those prehistoric Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=313}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Germans invaded Norway]] and the Nazi party took over the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other eleven were never recovered), including ''The Scream'' and ''The Sick Child'', and they too were hidden from the Nazis.<ref>{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=319}}</ref>\n\nMunch died in his house at Ekely near Oslo on 23 January 1944, about a month after his 80th birthday.

His \"private\" symbolism was far more personal than that of other Symbolist painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[James Ensor]]. Munch was still highly influential, particularly with the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionists]], who followed his philosophy, \"I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive result of Man's urge to open his heart.\"<ref name=Eg_p10/> Many of his paintings, including ''The Scream'', have universal appeal in addition to their highly personal meaning.\n\nMunch's works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. His cabin, \"the Happy House\", was given to the municipality of \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in 1944; it serves as a small Munch Museum. The inventory has been maintained exactly as he left it.\n\nOne version of ''The Scream'' was stolen from the National Gallery in 1994. In 2004, another version of ''The Scream'', along with one of ''Madonna'', was stolen from the Munch Museum in a daring daylight robbery. All were eventually recovered, but the paintings stolen in the 2004 robbery were extensively damaged. They have been meticulously restored and are on display again. Three Munch works were stolen from the Hotel [[Refsnes Gods]] in 2005; they were shortly recovered, although one of the works was damaged during the robbery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arts, Briefly; Munch Theft Confessions|work=The New York Times|date=10 March 2005 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EFD7163CF933A25750C0A9639C8B63 |accessdate=4 March 2010 | first=Walter | last=Gibbs}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2006, the color [[woodcut]] ''Two people.

It was announced in September 1988 by a [[consortium]] of [[IBM PC compatible|PC clone]] vendors (the \"Gang of Nine\") as a counter to IBM's use of its [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] [[Micro Channel architecture]] (MCA) in its [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] series.<ref name=announced>Compaq Leads 'Gang of Nine' In Offering Alternative to MCA, ''InfoWorld'', Sep 19, 1988</ref>\n\nEISA extends the AT bus, which the Gang of Nine [[Retronym|retroactively renamed]] to the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus to avoid infringing IBM's trademark on its [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC/AT computer]], to 32 [[bit]]s and allows more than one [[Central processing unit|CPU]] to share the bus. The [[bus mastering]] support is also enhanced to provide access to 4 [[gigabyte|GB]] of memory. Unlike MCA, EISA can accept older [[XT bus architecture|XT]] and ISA boards &mdash; the lines and slots for EISA are a superset of ISA.\n\nEISA was much favoured by manufacturers due to the proprietary nature of MCA, and even IBM produced some machines supporting it. It was somewhat expensive to implement (though not as much as MCA), so it never became particularly popular in desktop PCs. However, it was reasonably successful in the server market,<ref name=\"Daily1998\">{{cite book|author=Sean K. Daily|title=Optimizing Windows NT|year=1998|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-7645-3110-1|quote=\"EISA is still found on many of today's modern servers owing to its long-standing presence in the PC server market.\"|page=137}}</ref> as it was better suited to bandwidth-intensive tasks (such as disk access and networking). Most EISA cards produced were either [[SCSI]] or network cards. EISA was also available on some non-IBM compatible machines such as the [[AlphaServer]], [[HP 9000]]-D, [[SGI Indigo2]] and [[MIPS Magnum]].\n\nBy the time there was a strong market need for a bus of these speeds and capabilities for desktop computers, the [[VESA Local Bus]] and later [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] filled this niche and EISA vanished into obscurity.\n\n== History ==\nThe original [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] included five 8-bit slots, running at the system clock speed of 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC/AT]], introduced in 1984, had three 8-bit slots and five 16-bit slots, all running at the system clock speed of 6&nbsp;MHz in the earlier models and 8&nbsp;MHz in the last version of the computer.  The 16-bit slots were a superset of the 8-bit configuration, so ''most'' 8-bit cards were able to plug into a 16-bit slot (some cards used a \"skirt\" design that physically interfered with the extended portion of the slot) and continue to run in 8-bit mode. One of the key reasons for the success of the IBM PC (and the PC clones that followed it) was the active ecosystem of third-party expansion cards available for the machines.  IBM was restricted from patenting the bus, and widely published the bus specifications.\n\nAs the PC-clone industry continued to build momentum in the mid- to late-1980s, several problems with the bus began to be apparent.  First, because the \"AT slot\" (as it was known at the time) was not managed by any central standards group, there was nothing to prevent a manufacturer from \"pushing\" the standard.  One of the most common issues was that as PC clones became more common, PC manufacturers began ratcheting up the processor speed to maintain a competitive advantage.  Unfortunately, because the ISA bus was originally locked to the processor clock, this meant that some 286 machines had ISA buses that ran at 10, 12, or even 16&nbsp;MHz. In fact, the first system to clock the ISA bus at 8&nbsp;MHz was the turbo 8088 clones that clocked the processors at 8&nbsp;MHz. This caused many issues with incompatibility, where a true IBM-compatible third-party card (designed for an 8&nbsp;MHz or 4.77&nbsp;MHz bus) might not work in a higher speed system (or even worse, would work unreliably).  Most PC makers eventually decoupled the slot clock from the system clock, but there was still no standards body to \"police\" the industry.\n\nAs companies like [[Dell]] modified the AT bus design,<ref name=\"lewis19880424\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/business/the-executive-computer-introducing-the-first-ps-2-clones.html | title=Introducing the First PS/2 Clones | work=The New York Times | date=1988-04-24 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Lewis, Peter H.}}</ref> the architecture was so well entrenched that no single clone manufacturer had the leverage to create a standardized alternative, and there was no compelling reason for them to cooperate on a new standard.  Because of this, when the first [[Intel 80386|386]]-based system (the [[Compaq Deskpro]] 386) hit the market in 1986, it still supported 16-bit slots.  Other 386 PCs followed suit, and the AT (later ISA) bus remained a part of most systems even into the late 1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM began to worry that it was losing control of the industry it had created.  In 1987, IBM released the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] line of computers, which included the [[Micro Channel architecture|MCA]] bus.  MCA included numerous enhancements over the 16-bit AT bus, including [[bus mastering]], [[Burst mode (computing)|burst mode]], software configurable resources, and 32-bit capabilities.  However, in an effort to reassert its dominant role, IBM patented the bus, and placed stringent licensing and royalty policies on its use.  A few manufacturers did produce licensed MCA machines (most notably [[NCR Corporation|NCR]]), but overall the industry balked at IBM's restrictions.\n\n[[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] proposed that clone makers adopt [[NuBus]].<ref name=\"lemmons198708\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1987-08/1987_08_BYTE_12-09_Prolog_and_386_Hardware_Software#page/n9/mode/2up | title=Editorial | work=BYTE | date=August 1987 | accessdate=6 November 2013 | author=Lemmons, Phil | pages=6}}</ref> Instead, a group (the \"Gang of Nine\"), led by Compaq, created a new bus, which was named the Extended (or Enhanced) Industry Standard Architecture, or \"EISA\".

The additional features of the EISA bus are implemented on the lower part of the slot connector, using thin traces inserted into the insulating gap of the upper / ISA card card edge connector. Additionally the lower part of the bus has five keying notches, so an ISA card with unusually long traces cannot accidentally extend down into the lower part of the slot. \n\nIntel introduced their first EISA chipset (and also their first [[chipset]] in the modern sense of the word) as the [[82350]] in September 1989.<ref name=\"Mueller2011\">{{cite book|author=Scott M.

It included such features as [[multiprocessing]], hardware [[RAID]], and bus-mastering network cards.\n\nOne of the benefits to come out of the EISA standard was a final codification of the standard to which [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots and cards should be held (in particular, clock speed was fixed at an industry standard of 8.33&nbsp;MHz).  Thus, even systems which didn't use the EISA bus gained the advantage of having the ISA standardized, which contributed to its longevity.\n\n==The \"Gang of Nine\"==\nThe ''Gang of Nine'' was the informal name given to the [[consortium]] of personal computer manufacturing companies that together created the EISA bus. Rival members generally acknowledged Compaq's leadership, with one stating in 1989 that within the Gang of Nine \"when you have 10 people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president, someone has to write the letter. Compaq is sitting down at the typewriter\".<ref name=\"iw19890123\"/> The members were:<ref name=announced/>\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[AST Research|AST Research, Inc.]]\n* [[Compaq|Compaq Computer Corporation]]\n* [[Seiko Epson|Seiko Epson Corporation]]\n* [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard Company]]\n* [[NEC|NEC Corporation]]\n* [[Olivetti]]\n* [[Tandy Corporation]]\n* [[Dell Wyse|WYSE]]\n* [[Zenith Data Systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Technical data ==\n[[Image:EISA Bus pins.png|right|200px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| bus width || 32 [[bit]]\n|-----\n| compatible with || 8 bit ISA, 16 bit ISA, 32 bit EISA\n|-----\n|[[pin]]s || 98 + 100 inlay\n|-----\n| Vcc || +5 V, \u22125 V, +12 V, \u221212 V\n|-----\n| clock || 8.33&nbsp;MHz \n|-----\n| theoretical data rate (32 bit) || about 33 [[megabyte|MB]]/s (8.33&nbsp;MHz \u00d7 4 [[byte]]s)\n|-----\n| usable data rate (32 bit) || about 20 MB/s\n|}\n\nAlthough the MCA bus had a slight performance advantage over EISA (bus speed of 10&nbsp;MHz, compared to 8.33&nbsp;MHz), EISA contained almost all of the technological benefits that MCA boasted, including [[bus mastering]], [[Burst mode (computing)|burst mode]], software configurable resources, and 32-bit data/address buses.  These brought EISA nearly to par with MCA from a performance standpoint, and EISA easily defeated MCA in industry support.\n\nEISA replaced the tedious [[Jumper (computing)|jumper]] configuration common with ISA cards with software-based configuration.  Every EISA system shipped with an EISA configuration utility; this was usually a slightly customized version of the standard utilities written by the EISA chipset makers. The user would boot into this utility, either from [[floppy disk]] or on a dedicated hard drive partition.  The utility software would detect all EISA cards in the system, and could configure any hardware resources ([[Interrupt request|interrupt]]s, memory ports, etc.) on any EISA card (each EISA card would include a disk with information that described the available options on the card), or on the EISA system [[motherboard]].  The user could also enter information about ISA cards in the system, allowing the utility to automatically reconfigure EISA cards to avoid resource conflicts.\n\nSimilarly, [[Windows 95]], with its [[Plug and play|Plug-and-Play]] capability, was not able to change the configuration of EISA cards, but it could detect the cards, read their configuration, and reconfigure Plug and Play hardware to avoid resource conflicts.  Windows 95 would also automatically attempt to install appropriate drivers for detected EISA cards.\n\n== Industry Acceptance ==\nEISA's success was far from guaranteed.  Many manufacturers, including those in the \"Gang of Nine\", researched the possibility of using MCA.  For example, Compaq actually produced prototype DeskPro systems using the bus.  However, these were never put into production, and when it was clear that MCA had lost, Compaq allowed its MCA license to expire (the license actually cost relatively little; the primary costs associated with MCA, and at which the industry revolted, were royalties to be paid per system shipped).\n \nOn the other hand, when it became clear to IBM that Micro Channel was dying, IBM licensed EISA for use in a few server systems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Industry Standard Architecture]]  (ISA)\n* [[Micro Channel architecture]] (MCA)\n* [[NuBus]]\n* [[VESA Local Bus]] (VESA)\n* [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI)\n* [[Accelerated Graphics Port]] (AGP)\n* [[PCI Express]] (PCIe)\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[Amiga Zorro II]]\n* [[PCI-X]]\n* [[PC/104]]\n* [[CompactPCI]]\n* [[MiniPCI]]\n* [[PC card]]\n* [[Low Pin Count]] (LPC)\n* [[Universal Serial Bus]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.geekdot.com/category/knowledge-base/eisa-bus The Intel EISA chipset explained]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040214013557/http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/eisa.htm EISA bus technical summary]\n*[http://www.intel.com/design/archives/periphrl/index.htm Intel EISA Controllers]\n*[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102652375 Intel 82350 EISA chip family ]\n\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n{{Computer-bus}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computer buses]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n[[Category:Motherboard expansion slot]]", "sha1": "ceyaxrmdw3wfk75u3bfim21tp5j5pv6"}}, {"title": "EISA", "ns": "0", "id": "9782", "redirect": {"title": "Eisa"}, "revision": {"id": "783862327", "parentid": "290580110", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:47:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Eisa]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "2tfzye9hreyifl9bfz44gw59d68kkpy"}}, {"title": "Electromagnetic spectroscopy", "ns": "0", "id": "9788", "redirect": {"title": "Spectroscopy"}, "revision": {"id": "460112704", "parentid": "377655933", "timestamp": "2011-11-11T11:14:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision from [[:nost:Electromagnetic spectroscopy]]: import old edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Spectroscopy]]", "sha1": "gyeusjasjok1n2llm6miu0lao49qfqe"}}, {"title": "Earthdawn", "ns": "0", "id": "9789", "revision": {"id": "860192059", "parentid": "849974362", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T23:30:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jabberjaw", "id": "9895903"}, "comment": "/* References */ convert refs", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox game\n|title= Earthdawn\n|image= \n|caption= \n|designer= [[Greg Gorden]]\n|publisher= [[FASA Corporation|FASA]] ''(First Edition)''<br>[[Living Room Games]] ''(Second Edition)''<br>[[RedBrick Limited|RedBrick]] ''(Classic, Third, Revised Third Editions)''<br>[[FASA Games|FASA]] ''(Fourth Edition)''\n|date= 1993 ''(First Edition)''<br>2001 ''(Second Edition)''<br>2005 ''(Classic Edition)''<br>2009 ''(Third Edition)''<br>2012 ''(Revised Third Edition)''<br>2015 ''(Fourth Edition)''\n|genre= [[Fantasy]]\n|system= [[Step System]]\n|footnotes= Set in the same world as ''[[Shadowrun]]'', [[Millennium|millennia]] earlier\n}}\n[[File:earthdawngmc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Earthdawn Gamemaster's Compendium'' (RedBrick)]]\n'''''Earthdawn''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], originally produced by [[FASA Corporation|FASA]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author=Staff | title=Feature Review: Earthdawn\n | journal=[[Shadis]]\n |date=December 1993 | issue=10 }}</ref> In 1999 it was licensed to [[Living Room Games]], which produced the ''Second Edition''. It was licensed to [[RedBrick Limited|RedBrick]] in 2003, who released the Classic Edition in 2005 and the game's Third Edition in 2009 (the latter through [[Mongoose Publishing]]'s Flaming Cobra imprint). The license is now held (again) by FASA Corporation through FASA Games, Inc., who have released the Fourth Edition, with updated mechanics and an advanced metaplot timeline.\n\nThe game is similar to fantasy games like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but draws more inspiration from games like ''[[RuneQuest]]''. The rules of the game are tightly bound to the underlying [[magic (gaming)|magical]] [[metaphysics]], with the goal of creating a rich, logical fantasy world. Like many role-playing games from the nineties, ''Earthdawn'' focuses much of its detail on its [[Fantasy world|setting]], a province called Barsaive.\n\n==History==\nStarting in 1993, FASA released over 20 gaming supplements describing this universe; however, it closed down production of ''Earthdawn'' in January 1999. During that time several novels and short-story anthologies set in the ''Earthdawn'' universe were also released. In late 1999, FASA granted Living Room Games a licensing agreement to produce new material for the game.\n\nThe ''Second Edition'' did not alter the setting, though it did update the timeline to include events that took place in Barsaive. There were a few changes to the rules in the ''Second Edition''; some classes were slightly different or altered abilities from the original. The changes were meant to allow for more rounded characters and better balance of play. Living Room Games last published in 2005 and they no longer have a license with FASA to publish Earthdawn material.<ref>{{cite web| title=Living Room Games Forums| url= http://forums.lrgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1043&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=30| date=2009-01-30| accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 a second license was granted to RedBrick, who developed their own edition based on the FASA products, in addition to releasing the original FASA books in PDF form. The ''Earthdawn Classic Player's Compendium'' and ''Earthdawn Classic Gamemaster's Compendium'' are essentially an alternative Second Edition, but without a version designation (since the material is compatible anyway). Each book has over 500 pages and summarizes much of what FASA published\u2014not only the game mechanics, but also the setting, narrations, and stories. For example, each Discipline has its own chapter, describing it from the point of view of different adepts. Likewise, Barsaive gets a complete treatment, and the chapters contain a lot of log entries and stories in addition to the setting descriptions; the same applies to Horrors and Dragons. All previous Errata are merged into the text, correcting previous edition errors and providing rules clarifications.\n[[File:EDplayerscomp.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Earthdawn Player's Compendium'' (RedBrick)]] While RedBrick tried to remain faithful to FASA's vision and visual style, they revised almost everything and introduced new material to fill the gaps. RedBrick began publishing Earthdawn novels in 2007. In 2009, RedBrick announced the Third Edition of the game. In order to get a larger audience for this edition, RedBrick published the book through Mongoose Publishing's Flaming Cobra imprint. The first two books were released in July 2009. \nIn 2012, RedBrick announced the transfer of the Earthdawn license to FASA Games, Inc. FASA Games released RedBrick's Revised Third Edition Player's Guide, based on the Earthdawn Third Edition rules, but in a smaller format book. FASA noted, however, that there is no need for owners of the Third Edition to buy into the Revised Third Edition.\n\nIn 2014, FASA Games announced the forthcoming publication of Earthdawn Fourth Edition and launched a successful Kickstarter to support the project. Fourth Edition is described as a reworking of the game mechanics, with redundancies eliminated, and a simpler success level system. The game world is advanced five years, past the end of the Barsaive-Thera War, in order to clear dangling threads in the metaplot and open the game world to new stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/783548120/earthdawn-4th-edition|title=Earthdawn 4th Edition|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref> The first Fourth Edition title\u2014the Player's Guide\u2014was released in early 2015.

As the magic level rises, it allows alien creatures called Horrors to cross from their distant, otherworldly [[dimension]] into our own. The Horrors come in an almost infinite variety\u2014from simple eating machines that devour all they encounter, to incredibly intelligent and cunning foes that feed off the negative emotions they inspire in their prey.\n\nIn the distant past of ''Earthdawn'''s setting, an [[elf]] scholar discovered that the time of the Horrors was approaching, and founded the Eternal Library in order to discover a way to defeat them \u2014 or at the very least, survive them. The community that grew up around the library developed wards and protections against the Horrors, which they traded to other lands and eventually became the powerful Theran Empire, an extremely magically advanced civilization and the main antagonist of the ''Earthdawn'' setting.\n\nThe peoples of the world built kaers, underground towns and cities, which they sealed with the Theran wards to wait out the time of the Horrors, which was called the Scourge. Theran wizards and politicians warned many of the outlying nations around Thera of the coming of the Horrors, offering the protection of the kaers to those who would pledge their loyalty to the Empire. Most of these nations agreed at first though some became unwilling to fulfill their end of the bargain after the end of the Scourge, wanting to have nothing to do with the bureaucratic nation run on political conflict and powered by slavery. After four hundred years of hiding, the Scourge ended, and the people emerged to a world changed by the Horrors. The player characters explore this new world, discovering lost secrets of the past, and fighting Horrors that remain.\n\nThe primary setting of Earthdawn is Barsaive, a former province of the Theran Empire. Barsaive is a region of city-states, independent from the Therans since the [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarven]] Kingdom of Throal led a rebellion against their former overlords. The Theran presence in Barsaive has been limited to a small part of south-western Barsaive, located around the magical fortress of Sky Point and the city of Vivane.\n\nThe setting of Earthdawn is the same world as [[Shadowrun]] (i.e. a fictionalized version of [[Earth]]), but takes place millennia earlier. Indeed, the map of Barsaive and its neighboring regions established that most of the game takes place where [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] are in our world. However, the [[topography]] other than coastlines and major rivers is quite different, and the only apparent reference to the real world besides the map may be the Blood Wood, known as \"Wyrm Wood\" before the Scourge and similar in location and extent to the [[Chernobyl (city)#Name origin|Chernobyl]] (Ukrainian for \"wormwood\") [[Zone of alienation]]. Note should be made that game world links between ''Earthdawn'' and ''Shadowrun'' were deliberately broken by the publisher when the ''Shadowrun'' property was licensed out, in order to avoid the necessity for coordination between publishing companies. FASA has announced since that there are no plans to return ''Shadowrun'' to in-house publication, nor to restore the links between the game worlds.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nTwo Earthdawn supplements cover territories outside Barsaive. ''The Theran Empire'' book (First Edition) covers the Theran Empire and its provinces (which roughly correspond to the territories of the Roman Empire, plus colonies in America and India). ''Cathay: The Five Kingdoms'' (Third Edition) covers the lands of Cathay (Far East).\n\n===Races===\nThe setting of ''Earthdawn'' features several fantasy races for characters and NPCs:\n# [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]] - Dwarfs in ''Earthdawn'' are similar in appearance to the classic ''[[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]]'' or [[Tolkien]] dwarfs. They are the predominant race in Barsaive, and the dwarf language is considered the common language. Their culture, especially of the dominant Throal Kingdom, can be considered more of a [[Renaissance]]-level culture than in most other fantasy settings, and forms the main source of resistance to a return of [[Theran Empire|Thera]]'s rule in Barsaive.\n# [[Elf]] - Elves in ''Earthdawn'' fit the common fantasy role playing convention; they are tall, lithe, pointy-eared humanoids who prefer living in nature. Elves in ''Earthdawn'' naturally live a very long time; some are thought to be immortal. Such immortal Elves feature in many cross-pollinated storylines with ''[[Shadowrun]]''. A subrace of ''Earthdawn'' elves are called the Blood Elves. The blood elves rejected the Theran protective magic, and attempted their own warding spells. These wards failed, and a last-ditch ritual caused thorns to thrust through the skin of the blood elves. These ever-bleeding wounds caused constant pain, but the self-inflicted suffering was enough to protect the blood elves from the worst of the Horrors.\n# [[Human]] - Humans in ''Earthdawn'' are physically similar to humans in our own real world. Human adepts are granted a special Versatility talent to make them more mechanically appealing. Humans in ''Earthdawn'' are considered to be somewhat warlike in general outlook.\n# Obsidiman - Obsidimen are a race of large, rock-based humanoids. They stand over {{convert|7|ft|m}} tall and weigh over 900 pounds. Their primary connection is to their Liferock, which is a large formation of stone that they emerge from. Obsidimen are loyal to the community around their Liferock, and eventually return to and re-merge with it. Obsidimen can live around 500 years away from their Liferock, and their ultimate lifespan is unknown, as they generally return to it and remain there. Due to their rocky nature and long lives, obsidimen are rather slow moving and deliberate in both speech and action, and can have difficulty understanding the smaller races' need for haste. However, if aroused by a threat to self, friend, or community, obsidimen are fearsome to behold.\n# [[Orc|Ork]] - The ork race in ''Earthdawn'' is physically similar to other depictions of orks in fantasy role-playing. They are tribal, nomadic and often barbaric humanoids, with olive, tan, beige or ebony skin. They are relatively short-lived, and as a result many attempt to leave a legacy marked by a memorable death\u2014preferably one that leaves no corpse. Before the Scourge almost all orks were enslaved by other races.\n# [[Troll]] - The troll race in ''Earthdawn'' is also similar in appearance to many other fantasy role playing depictions of trolls. They are very tall humanoids, with a hardened skin and horns. Socially, they form clans to which they are fiercely loyal. Troll clans often raid one another, and a significant subset of the troll race are crystal raiders, which command many of the airships of Barsaive. Other trolls, known as lowland trolls, have merged with mixed communities around Barsaive, although most retain the fierce cultural and personal pride of their less-civilized cousins.\n# T'skrang - The t'skrang are lizard-like amphibian humanoids with long tails and a flair for dramatics. Many of them exhibit the behaviors and characteristics which are stereotypical to a \"swashbuckler\". T'skrang are often sailors, and many t'skrang families run ships up and down the rivers of Barsaive. A rare subrace of t'skrang, the ''k'stulaami'', possess a flap of skin much like a [[flying squirrel]]'s patagium, allowing them to glide. While ''k'stulaami'' can be born as a random mutation in any t'skrang line, they tend to congregate into communities filled with their own kind.\n# Windling - The windlings are small, winged humanoids; similar to many depictions of [[fairy|fae]] creatures, they resemble small elves with insect-like wings. They have the ability to see into the astral plane, and are considerably luckier than the other races. Windlings are often somewhat mischievous, hedonistic, and eager for new experiences, and are culturally similar to the [[Kender (fantasy)|Kender]] of [[Krynn]], but without the same [[kleptomania]]cal tendencies. They have wings similar to those of a dragonfly and are one to two feet in height.\n# Leafer - A Race native to the Dark Forest of Vasgothia, the Leafers are a race of sentient plant Name-Givers.\n# Ulkmen - Another Race unique to Vasgothia, the Ulkmen are Name-Givers that have been merged with Horrors. In addition to his Talents, an Ulkman Adept gains a Horror Power every 4 Circles. Despite their origins & horrific appearance, the Ulkmen are a largely peaceful people.\n# Jubruq - The only 'Half-race' in Earthdawn, Jubruq are half human or ork and half elemental spirit. They are native to the Sufik Tribes of Marak.\n# Jackelmen - Native to Creana, Jackelmen have the body of a human and the head of a jackal. They are a warrior people and are thought to practice cannibalism.\n\n===Political entities===\n;Barsaive (Ukraine/Russia/Byelorussia)\n:*Throal Kingdom/Throal (dwarves, monarchy)\n:*Iopos (city state, magocracy)\n:*Blood Wood (Elves, monarchy)\n:*Kratas (city of thieves, kleptocracy)\n:*Urupa (city-state, important port)\n:*Jerris (city-state)\n:*Travar (city-state)\n:*Trollish clans of mountains (sky raiders)\n:*T'skrang clans (''aropagoi'') of the Serpent River (traders)\n:*Vivane (city-state, under occupation by Thera)\n:*Haven and Parlainth (ruins)\n:*Great Dragons\n:*various Secret Societies\n;Outside Barsaive\n:*Theran Empire (Thera)\n:*Cathay (China)\n:*Jih Poh (Japan)\n:*Indrisa (India)\n:*Shosara (Scandinavia)\n:*Talea (Italy)\n:*Vivane (Moesia)\n:*Rugaria (Thracia)\n:*Creana (Egypt)\n:*Arancia (France)\n:*Marac (North Africa)\n:*Vasgothia (Germany)\n:*Torinachia (Considered a smaller Province within Vasgothia, famous for its wines)\n:*Aznan (Horn of Africa)\n:*Fekara (African Continent)\n:*Araucania (South America)\n:*Slithering Wastes (Spain)\n:*Ulustan (Turkey) \n:*Issyr (Persia)\n\n===Magic in ''Earthdawn''===\n''Earthdawn'''s magic system is highly varied but the essential idea is that all player characters (called [[Adepts]]) have access to magic, used to perform abilities attained through their Disciplines.\n\nEach Discipline is given a unique set of ''Talents'' which are used to access the world's magic. Legend points (the ''Earthdawn'' equivalent of [[experience points]]) can be spent to put up the characters level in the Talent, increasing his step level for the ability, making the user more proficient at using that specific type of magic.\n\nCaster Disciplines use the same Talent system as others, but also have access to ''spells''. How a player character obtains spells varies depending on his Game Master; but how they are used is universal. Casters all have special Talents called ''spell matrixes'' which they can place spells into. A spell ''attuned'' (placed into) to a matrix is easily accessible and can be cast at any time. Spells can be switched at the players will while out of combat. Once engaged in combat, however, they must use an action to do so (called re-attuning on the fly), which requires a set difficulty they must achieve, or risk losing their turn.\n\nIt is generally recommended that Casters only use attuned spells, but this is not required. Casting a spell that is not in a matrix is referred to as ''raw casting''. Raw casting is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the Earthdawn magic system. If the spell is successfully cast, it has its normal effects along with added consequences. Raw casting has a very good chance of drawing the attention of a Horror, which can quickly turn into death for low level characters (and for high level characters as well in some cases).\n\nOne of the most innovative ideas in ''Earthdawn'' is how magical items work. At first, most magical items work exactly like a mundane item of the same type. As a character searches for information about the item's history, performs certain tasks relating to that history, and spends legend points to activate the item, he unlocks some of the magic in the item. As the character learns more about the item and its history, he can unlock more and more power within the item.\n\nEach magical item, therefore, is unique by virtue of its history and the scope of its powers. For example, one magical broadsword may have only 4 magical ranks and only increases the damage of the blade. On the other hand, the legendary sword Purifier, has 10 magical ranks and grants its wielder numerous powers.\n\n==Game mechanics==\n[[File:Earthdawn companion ldged-201.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The ''Earthdawn Companion 2nd Edition'' cover shows Throal, the capital of Barsaive]]\n\n''Earthdawn'' stands out from other tabletop RPGs with a unique approach to skill tests. Players wanting to perform an action determine their level or \"step\" for the skill, talent, or ability to be used. This step can then be looked up in a list of dice to be thrown; it is the next-highest [[integer]] of the average roll of the dice(s) in question. For example, two six-sided dice will on average yield a result of 7,<ref>Actually, due to the bonus dice mechanic it is 8.4</ref> thus the step number 8 means that 2d6 will be rolled. The consequence is that each such dice roll has a 50% chance of yielding a result at least as high as the corresponding step number.\n\nThe result of each die is added (dice which reach their maximum value are thrown again, adding each maximum to the tally, along with the final result below maximum) and compared to a value decided by the game master/storyteller according to the difficulty of the task. This approach means it's always technically possible to succeed with a low step number, yet leaves room for failure on high step numbers. This will sometimes make combat last longer than in other games. As per the above, the difficulty value where the odds of success are perfectly even is identical to the step number.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Examples of steps\n! Step !! Dice to be thrown (Classic and 2nd Edition) !! Dice to be thrown (3rd Edition)\n|-\n| 1 || 1d4-2 || 1d6-3\n|-\n| 2 || 1d4-1 || 1d6-2\n|-\n| 3 || 1d4 || 1d6-1\n|-\n| 4 || 1d6 || 1d6\n|-\n| 5 || 1d8 || 1d8\n|-\n| 6 || 1d10 || 1d10\n|-\n| 7 || 1d12 || 1d12\n|-\n| 8 || 2d6 || 2d6\n|-\n| 9 || 1d8 + 1d6 || 1d8 + 1d6\n|-\n| 10 || 1d10 + 1d6 || 2d8\n|-\n| 11 || 1d10 + 1d8 || 1d10 + 1d8\n|-\n| 12 || 2d10 || 2d10\n|-\n| 13 || 1d12 + 1d10 || 1d12 + 1d10\n|-\n| 14 || 1d20 + 1d4 or 2d12 (''Earthdawn Classic'' option) || 2d12\n|}\n\nThe dice in steps 3 through 13 form the basis of an 11-step cycle. To form steps 14-24, add 1d20. To form steps 25-35, further add 1d10 + 1d8. For higher cycles, continue alternating between the addition of 1d20 and 1d10 + 1d8. Step 2 is rolled as step 3, but you subtract 1 from the result. This is notated as \"1d4 - 1\". Step 1 is 1d4 - 2.\n\nThe 3rd edition changes this by removing d4s and d20s from the system. Steps 6 through 12 (as listed above) form the basis of a 7-step cycle. To add 7 steps from then on, simply add 1d12.\n\n==Reception==\n''Earthdawn'' was ranked 24th in the 1996 reader poll of ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.  The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"Very good indeed. ''Earthdawn'' combined traditional fantasy with ''Call of Cthulhu''-style horror and a detailed background to create an evocative and interesting setting. Combined with a clear, well-designed rules system and an impressive range of supporting supplements and adventures, this is an excellent fantasy game. It's also of special interest to fans of ''Shadowrun'', because it describes the past of the same gameworld.\"<ref name=\"Arcane14\">{{cite journal|last= Pettengale|first=Paul|date= Christmas 1996 |title=Arcane Presents the Top 50 Roleplaying Games 1996|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=14|pages=25-35}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Earthdawn'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''. Editor [[Scott Haring]] noted (referring to the FASA edition) that \"''Earthdawn'' had an original, inventive magic system (no mean trick given the hundreds of fantasy RPGs that came before), and a game world that gave you the classic \"monsters and dungeons\" sort of RPG experience, but made sense doing it.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n{{main article|list of Earthdawn books}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://earthdawn.fasagames.com FASA Games, Inc.

[[Technical standard]]s for EDI exist to facilitate parties transacting such instruments without having to make special arrangements.\n\nEDI has existed at least since the early 70s, and there are many EDI standards (including [[ASC X12|X12]], [[EDIFACT]], [[OFTP|ODETTE]], etc.), some of which address the needs of specific industries or regions.  It also refers specifically to a family of standards.  In 1996, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] defined electronic data interchange as \"the computer-to-computer interchange of strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments. EDI implies a sequence of messages between two parties, either of whom may serve as originator or recipient. The formatted data representing the documents may be transmitted from originator to recipient via telecommunications or physically transported on electronic storage media.\" It distinguished mere electronic communication or data exchange, specifying that \"in EDI, the usual processing of received messages is by computer only. Human intervention in the processing of a received message is typically intended only for error conditions, for quality review, and for special situations. For example, the transmission of binary or textual data is not EDI as defined here unless the data are treated as one or more data elements of an EDI message and are not normally intended for human interpretation as part of on-line data processing.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=FIPS PUB 161-2: Electronic Date Interchange (EDI) |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=1996-04-29 |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip161-2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511043940/https://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip161-2.htm |archivedate=2008-05-11}} Standard withdrawn: 2008-09-02.</ref> In short, EDI can be defined as the transfer of structured data, by agreed message standards, from one computer system to another without human intervention.\n\n==History==\nLike many other early information technologies, EDI was inspired by developments in [[military logistics]]. The complexity of the [[Berlin Airlift|1948 Berlin airlift]] required the development of concepts and methods to exchange, sometimes over a 300 baud teletype [[modem]], vast quantities of data and information about transported goods. These initial concepts later shaped the first TDCC (Transportation Data Coordinating Committee) standards in the US.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Gifkins | first1 = Mike\n | last2 = Hitchcock | first2 = David\n | title = The EDI handbook\n | publisher = Blenheim Online\n | date = 1988\n | location = London }}\n</ref> Among the first integrated systems using EDI were Freight Control Systems. One such real-time system was the London Airport Cargo EDP Scheme (LACES) at Heathrow Airport, London, UK, in 1971. Implementing the direct trader input (DTI) method, it allowed forwarding agents to enter information directly into the [[Customs]] processing system reducing the time for clearance. The increase of maritime traffic and problems at Customs similar to those experienced at Heathrow Airport led to the implementation of DTI systems in individual [[port]]s or group of ports in the 1980s.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Tweddle| first = Douglas\n | contribution = EDI in International Trade: a Customs View\n | title = The EDI handbook\n | editor-last1 = Gifkins | editor-first1 = Mike\n | editor-last2 = Hitchcock | editor-first2 = David\n | publisher = Blenheim Online\n | date = 1988\n | location = London }}\n</ref>\n\n==Standards==\n<!-- === Overview === -->\nEDI provides a technical basis for automated commercial \"conversations\" between two entities, either internal or external. The term EDI encompasses the entire electronic data interchange process, including the transmission, message flow, document format, and software used to interpret the documents. However, EDI standards describe the rigorous format of electronic documents, and the EDI standards were designed by the implementers, initially in the Automotive industry, to be independent of communication and software technologies. EDI can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient. This includes a variety of technologies, including modem (asynchronous and synchronous), [[File transfer protocol|FTP]], e-mail, [[HTTP]], [[AS1 (networking)|AS1]], [[AS2]], [[AS4]] etc. It is important to differentiate between the EDI documents and the methods for transmitting them. When they compared the [[synchronous protocol]] 2400 bit/s modems, [[CLEO (router)|CLEO]] devices, and [[value-added network]]s used to transmit EDI documents to transmitting via the Internet, some people equated the non-Internet technologies with EDI and predicted erroneously that EDI itself would be replaced along with the non-Internet technologies. These non-internet transmission methods are being replaced by [[Internet protocol]]s such as FTP, HTTP, [[telnet]], and e-mail, but the EDI documents themselves still remain.\n\nAs more trading partners use the Internet for transmission, standards have emerged. In 2002, the [[IETF]] published RFC 3335, offering a standardized, secure method of transferring EDI data via e-mail. On July 12, 2005, an IETF working group ratified [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4130.txt RFC4130] for [[MIME]]-based HTTP EDIINT (a.k.a. [[AS2]]) transfers, and the IETF has prepared a similar RFC for FTP transfers (a.k.a. [[AS3 (networking)|AS3]]). EDI via web services (a.k.a. [[AS4]]) has also been standardised by the OASIS standards body. While some EDI transmission has moved to these newer protocols, the providers of [[value-added network]]s remain active.\n\nEDI documents generally contain the same information that would normally be found in a paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship product to a retailer. It typically has a 'ship-to' address, a 'bill-to' address, and a list of product numbers (usually a [[Universal Product Code|UPC]]) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as [[request for quotation]] (RFQ), bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase order acknowledgement, shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and payment advice. However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a paper flow before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged.\n\nSome major sets of EDI standards:\n* The [[United Nations|UN]]-recommended [[UN/EDIFACT]] is the only international standard and is predominant outside of North America.\n* The [[United States|US]] standard [[ASC X12|ANSI ASC X12]] (X12) is predominant in North America.\n* [[GS1 EDI]] set of standards developed the [[GS1]] predominant in global [[supply chain]]\n* The [[TRADACOMS]] standard developed by the ANA (Article Number Association now known as [[GS1 UK]]) is predominant in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] retail industry.\n* The ODETTE standard used within the European automotive industry\n* The VDA standard used within the European automotive industry mainly in Germany\n* [[HL7 Services Aware Interoperability Framework|HL7]], a semantic interoperability standard used for healthcare data.\n* Edig@s (EDIGAS) is a standard dealing with commerce, transport (via pipeline or container) and storage of gas.\nMany of these standards first appeared in the early to mid 1980s. The standards prescribe the formats, character sets, and data elements used in the exchange of business documents and forms. The complete [[X12 Document List]] includes all major business documents, including purchase orders and invoices.\n\nThe EDI standard prescribes mandatory and optional information for a particular document and gives the rules for the structure of the document. The standards are like building codes. Just as two kitchens can be built \"[[building code|to code]]\" but look completely different, two EDI documents can follow the same standard and contain different sets of information. For example, a food company may indicate a product's expiration date while a clothing manufacturer would choose to send color and size information.\n<!-- Need to create more sections. This is the \"standards\" section.\nNeed sections for Comms, Xlators, History, UNEDIFACT-->\n\n==Specifications==\nOrganizations that send or receive documents between each other are referred to as \"trading partners\" in EDI terminology. The trading partners agree on the specific information to be transmitted and how it should be used. This is done in human readable specifications (also called Message Implementation Guidelines). While the standards are analogous to building codes, the specifications are analogous to blue prints. (The specification may also be called a \"mapping,\" but the term mapping is typically reserved for specific machine-readable instructions given to the translation software.) Larger trading \"hubs\" have existing Message Implementation Guidelines which mirror their business processes for processing EDI and they are usually unwilling to modify their EDI business practices to meet the needs of their trading partners. Often in a large company these EDI guidelines will be written to be generic enough to be used by different branches or divisions and therefore will contain information not needed for a particular business document exchange. For other large companies, they may create separate EDI guidelines for each branch/division.\n\n==Transmission==\nTrading partners are free to use any method for the transmission of documents. Furthermore, they can either interact directly, or through an [[intermediary]].\n\n===Peer-to-peer===\n\nTrading partners can connect directly to each other. For example, an automotive manufacturer might maintain a modem-pool that all of its hundreds of suppliers are required to dial into to perform EDI.  However, if a supplier does business with several manufacturers, it may need to acquire a different modem (or VPN device, etc.) and different software for each one.\n\n===Value-added networks===\n\nTo address the limitations in peer-to-peer adoption of EDI, [[Value-added network|VANs (value-added networks)]] were established.  A VAN acts as a regional post office. It receives transactions, examines the 'from' and the 'to' information, and routes the transaction to the final recipient. VANs may provide a number of additional services, e.g. retransmitting documents, providing third party audit information, acting as a gateway for different transmission methods, and handling telecommunications support. Because of these and other services VANs provide, businesses frequently use a VAN even when both trading partners are using Internet-based protocols. Healthcare clearinghouses perform many of the same functions as a VAN, but have additional legal restrictions.\n\nVANs may be operated by various entities:\n* telecommunication companies;\n* industry group consortia;\n* a large company interacting with its suppliers/vendors.\n\n=== Internet ===\nAs more organizations connected to the Internet, eventually most or all EDI was pushed onto it.  Initially, this was through ad hoc conventions, such as unencrypted FTP of ASCII text files to a certain folder on a certain host, permitted only from certain IP addresses. However, the [[IETF]] has published several informational documents (the \"Applicability Statements\"; see below under '''Protocols''') describing ways to use standard Internet protocols for EDI.\n\nAs of 2002, [[Walmart]] have pushed the [[AS2]] for EDI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.opentext.com/as2-and-internet-edi-nine-years-later/|title=AS2 and Internet EDI \u2013 Nine Years Later - OpenText Blogs|date=9 September 2011|publisher=}}</ref> Because of its significant presence in the global supply chain, AS2 have become a commonly adopted approach for EDI.\n\n==Interpreting data==\n''EDI translation software'' provides the interface between internal systems and the EDI format sent/received. For an \"inbound\" document the EDI solution will receive the file (either via a Value Added Network or directly using protocols such as FTP or AS2), take the received EDI file (commonly referred to as an \"envelope\"), validate that the trading partner who is sending the file is a valid trading partner, that the structure of the file meets the EDI standards, and that the individual fields of information conform to the agreed upon standards. Typically the translator will either create a file of either fixed length, variable length or XML tagged format or \"print\" the received EDI document (for non-integrated EDI environments). The next step is to convert/transform the file that the translator creates into a format that can be imported into a company's back-end business system or ERP. This can be accomplished by using a custom program, an integrated proprietary \"mapper\" or an integrated standards based graphical \"mapper,\" using a standard data transformation language such as [[XSLT]]. The final step is to import the transformed file (or database) into the company's back-end system.\n\nFor an \"outbound\" document the process for integrated EDI is to export a file (or read a database) from a company's information systems and transform the file to the appropriate format for the translator. The translation software will then \"validate\" the EDI file sent to ensure that it meets the standard agreed upon by the trading partners, convert the file into \"EDI\" format (adding the appropriate identifiers and control structures) and send the file to the trading partner (using the appropriate communications protocol).\n\nAnother critical component of any EDI translation software is a complete \"audit\" of all the steps to move business documents between trading partners. The audit ensures that any transaction (which in reality is a business document) can be tracked to ensure that they are not lost. In case of a retailer sending a Purchase Order to a supplier, if the Purchase Order is \"lost\" anywhere in the business process, the effect is devastating to both businesses. To the supplier, they do not fulfill the order as they have not received it thereby losing business and damaging the business relationship with their retail client. For the retailer, they have a stock outage and the effect is lost sales, reduced customer service and ultimately lower profits.\n\nIn EDI terminology \"inbound\" and \"outbound\" refer to the direction of transmission of an EDI document in relation to a particular system, not the direction of merchandise, money or other things represented by the document. For example, an EDI document that tells a warehouse to perform an outbound shipment is an inbound document in relation to the warehouse computer system. It is an outbound document in relation to the manufacturer or dealer that transmitted the document.\n\n==Advantages over paper systems==\nEDI and other similar technologies save a company money by providing an alternative to, or replacing, information flows that require a great deal of human interaction and paper documents. Even when paper documents are maintained in parallel with EDI exchange, e.g. printed shipping manifests, electronic exchange and the use of data from that exchange reduces the handling costs of sorting, distributing, organizing, and searching paper documents. EDI and similar technologies allow a company to take advantage of the benefits of storing and manipulating data electronically without the cost of manual entry. Another advantage of EDI is the opportunity to reduce or eliminate manual data entry errors, such as shipping and billing errors, because EDI eliminates the need to rekey documents on the destination side. One very important advantage of EDI over paper documents is the speed in which the trading partner receives and incorporates the information into their system thus greatly reducing cycle times. For this reason, EDI can be an important component of just-in-time production systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecommerce.hostip.info/pages/384/Electronic-Data-Interchange-EDI.html|title=Ecommerce- advantages of EDI format|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2008 Aberdeen report \"A Comparison of Supplier Enablement around the World\", only 34% of purchase orders are transmitted electronically in North America. In [[Europe, Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], 36% of orders are transmitted electronically and in [[Asia-Pacific|APAC]], 41% of orders are transmitted electronically. They also report that the average paper requisition to order costs a company $37.45 in North America, $42.90 in EMEA and $23.90 in APAC. With an EDI requisition to order costs are reduced to $23.83 in North America, $34.05 in EMEA and $14.78 in APAC.\n\n==Barriers to implementation==\nThere are a few barriers to adopting electronic data interchange. One of the most significant barriers is the accompanying business process change. Existing business processes built around paper handling may not be suited for EDI and would require changes to accommodate automated processing of business documents. For example, a business may receive the bulk of their goods by 1 or 2 day shipping and all of their invoices by mail. The existing process may therefore assume that goods are typically received before the invoice. With EDI, the invoice will typically be sent when the goods ship and will therefore require a process that handles large numbers of invoices whose corresponding goods have not yet been received.\n\nAnother significant barrier is the cost in time and money in the initial set-up. The preliminary expenses and time that arise from the implementation, customization and training can be costly. It is important to select the correct level of integration to match the business requirement. For a business with relatively few transactions with EDI-based partners, it may make sense for businesses to implement inexpensive \"rip and read\" solutions, where the EDI format is printed out in [[human-readable]] form and people, rather than computers, respond to the transaction. Another alternative is outsourced EDI solutions provided by EDI \"Service Bureaus\". For other businesses, the implementation of an integrated EDI solution may be necessary as increases in trading volumes brought on by EDI force them to re-implement their order processing business processes.\n\nThe key hindrance to a successful implementation of EDI is the perception many businesses have of the nature of EDI. Many view EDI from the technical perspective that EDI is a data format; it would be more accurate to take the business view that EDI is a system for exchanging business documents with external entities, and integrating the data from those documents into the company's internal systems. Successful implementations of EDI take into account the effect externally generated information will have on their internal systems and validate the business information received. For example, allowing a supplier to update a retailer's Accounts Payable system without appropriate checks and balances would put the company at significant risk. Businesses new to the implementation of EDI must understand the underlying business process and apply proper judgment.\n\n==Acknowledgement==\nBelow are common EDI acknowledgement<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.opentext.com/whats-the-difference-between-the-4-types-of-edi-acknowledgments/|title=What\u2019s the difference between the 4 types of EDI acknowledgments? - OpenText Blogs|date=21 October 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Communication Status \u2013 Indicate the transmission completed\n* MDN (Message Disposition Notification) \u2013 In AS2 only, indicate the message is readable \n* Functional Acknowledgement \u2013 typically \"997\" in ANSI, or \"CONTRL\" in EDIFACT, which indicate the message content is verified against its template, and tell if the transaction is posted to the receiver's electronic system.\n* Business Level Acknowledgement \u2013 the final indicator shows if the transaction is accepted by the receiver or not.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Expense and Cost Recovery System (ECRS)]]\n* [[Extract, transform, load|Extract, transform, load (ETL)]]\n* [[Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard|Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard (LEDES)]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n;Protocols\n* [[HTTP]]/[[HTTPS]]\n* [[POP3]]/[[SMTP]]\n* [[OFTP]]/[[OFTP2]]\n* [[SOAP]]\n* [[WebDAV]]\n* [[X.400]]\n* EDIINT working group:\n** EDIINT [[AS1 (networking)|AS1]] (extension to mail transport)\n** EDIINT [[AS2]] (based on HTTP transport)\n** EDIINT [[AS3 (networking)|AS3]] (based on FTP transport)\n** EDIINT [[AS4]] (based on WebServices)\n'''Formats'''\n* ''[[ANSI]] X.12''\n** [[ASC X12|X12]]\n** [[X12 Document List]]\n** [[X12 EDIFACT Mapping]]\n* ''XML''\n** [[cXML]]\n** [[xCBL]]\n** [[ebXML]]\n** [[RosettaNet]]\n** [[Universal Business Language|UBL]]\n* [[TRADACOMS|Tradacoms]]\n* [[EDIFACT]]\n* [[CEFIC]] \u2013 Chemical\n* [[GS1]] EANCOM \u2013 Retail\n* EDIBDB \u2013 Construction\n* EDIFICE \u2013 High Tech Industry\n* EDIFURN \u2013 Furniture\n* EDILEKTRO \u2013 Electro\n* EDILIBE \u2013 Books\n* EDITEC \u2013 Sanitary\n* EDITEX \u2013 Fashion\n* EDIFOR/EDITRANS \u2013 Transports & Logistics\n* EDIWHEEL \u2013 Wheels & Tires\n* ETIS \u2013 Telecommunication\n* STAR \u2013 Standards for Technology in Automotive Retail\n* SPEC2000 (Airline Industry) ([http://www.spec2000.com/ external link])\n* [[FORTRAS]] \u2013 Transports & Logistics\n\n;Fixed-length formats\n* EURITMO\n\n;Separator formats\n* [[Comma-separated values|CSV]]/[[Tabulator-separated values|TSV]]/[[Delimiter-separated values|DSV]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gengeswari, K. and Abu Bakar Abdul Hamid (2010). \"Integration of electronic data interchange: a review\", ''Jurnal Kemanusiaan'', {{ISSN|1675-1930}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.the-financedirector.com/features/feature1420/#adEnd \"E-Procurement \u2014 Electronic Data Integration Comes of Age\"] \u2013 Article from Finance Director Europe Journal\n* [https://xedi.com/resources/edi-protocols EDI Protocols] \u2013 An overview of the various protocols and formats used in EDI networks\n* [https://xedi.com/resources/edi-standards EDI Standards] \u2013 An overview of the various EDI file format standards available.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:E-commerce]]\n[[Category:Computer data]]\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n[[Category:Data interchange standards]]\n[[Category:EDI| ]]", "sha1": "87fg8kgc4lqiitqcwdoxawqewmywxh3"}}, {"title": "Ecstacy", "ns": "0", "id": "9791", "redirect": {"title": "Ecstasy"}, "revision": {"id": "706746475", "parentid": "194979290", "timestamp": "2016-02-25T01:50:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision imported from [[:nost:Ecstacy]]: importod edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Ecstasy]]", "sha1": "ar31nck6g6ujca28n1p146egm3wr2y5"}}, {"title": "Extravehicular activity", "ns": "0", "id": "9792", "revision": {"id": "864641880", "parentid": "849732965", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T14:54:18Z", "contributor": {"ip": "65.94.42.168"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Spacewalk|other uses}}\n[[File:Volkov during Russian EVA28.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Sergey Volkov (cosmonaut)|Sergey Volkov]] works outside the International Space Station on August 3, 2011.]]\n[[File:Sts114 033.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stephen Robinson]] riding the [[Canadarm|robotic arm]] during [[STS-114]], doing a first in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle.

The term most commonly applies to a '''spacewalk''' made outside a craft orbiting Earth (such as the [[International Space Station]]), but also has applied to [[Moon|lunar]] surface exploration (commonly known as '''moonwalks''') performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the [[Apollo program]] from 1969 to 1972. On each of the last three of these missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. Astronauts also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to [[Skylab]], the United States' first space station.\n\nA \"Stand-up\" EVA (SEVA) is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft, but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support.<ref name=\"standup\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.seva.html|title=Stand-Up EVA|accessdate=October 21, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}</ref> Its name derives from the astronaut \"standing up\" in the open hatch, usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut.\n\nEVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an [[umbilical cable]]; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the [[Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue]] (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.\n\nThe Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, and China have conducted EVAs.\n\n==Development history==\n[[NASA]] planners invented the term ''extravehicular activity'' (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the [[Apollo program]] to land men on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect [[moon rock|lunar material samples]] and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the [[Project Gemini|Gemini program]] was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the [[Soviet Union]] was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in manned spaceflight, so the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]], led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], ordered the conversion of its single-pilot [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]] capsule into a two- or three-person craft named [[Voskhod spacecraft|Voskhod]], in order to compete with Gemini and [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]].<ref name=\"Siddiqi 384-6\">{{cite book\n |title= Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge\n |last= Siddiqi\n |first= Asif A.\n |authorlink=\n |year= 2003a\n |publisher= [[University Press of Florida]]\n |location= Gainesville\n |isbn= 0-8130-2627-X\n}}</ref> The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first manned Gemini.\n\nThe Voskhod's [[avionics]] required cooling by cabin air to prevent overheating, therefore an [[airlock]] was required for the spacewalking [[cosmonaut]] to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. By contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now [[Russia]]n) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in [[vacuum]]. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft.<ref>''Walking to Olympus'', p. ix.</ref> The USA has changed its EVA definition since.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===First spacewalk===\n[[File:FirstSpaceWalk.png|thumb|right|[[Alexei Leonov]] performs the first spacewalk during Voskhod 2 (March 1965)]]\nThe first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov]], who spent 12 minutes outside the [[Voskhod 2]] spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his {{convert|15.35|m|abbr=on}} tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his [[space suit]] ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.<ref name=\"portree\"/>\n\nAt the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking \"[[decompression sickness|the bends]]\". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by {{convert|1.8|C-change|F-change}} from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in [[weightlessness]] and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"portree\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/walking/EVAChron.pdf |title=Walking to Olympus: An EVA Chronology |accessdate=2015-07-30 |last=Portree |first=David S.

The next EVA was planned to be made by [[David Scott]] on [[Gemini 8]], but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights ([[Eugene Cernan]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.|Richard Gordon]]), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force [[Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] which included a self-contained oxygen system.\n\nOn November 13, 1966, [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]] became the first to successfully work in space without tiring, on the [[Gemini 12]] last flight. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in [[scuba diving]] inspired the use of [[Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|underwater EVA training]] to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.\n\n===First EVA crew transfer===\nOn January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts [[Aleksei Yeliseyev]] and [[Yevgeny Khrunov]] transferred from [[Soyuz 5]] to [[Soyuz 4]], which were docked together.

They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged [[Skylab]] [[space station]] by freeing a stuck [[solar panels on spacecraft|solar panel]], deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews.<ref name=\"portree\"/> They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2\u00bd times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered [[spacesickness]] early in their flights.<ref name=\"reusestudy\">''[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790075817_1979075817.pdf Skylab Reuse Study]'', p. 3-53.

In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]] space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.<ref name=\"portree\"/>\n\nWhen the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Chinese EVA===\nChina became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008 during the [[Shenzhou 7]] mission.

There are two types of electric charges; ''positive'' and ''negative'' (commonly carried by [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s respectively). Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as ''{{Visible anchor|neutral|neutral}}''. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called [[classical electrodynamics]], and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].\n\nElectric charge is a [[conservation law (physics)|conserved property]]; the net charge of an [[isolated system]], the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge, cannot change. Electric charge is carried by [[subatomic particle]]s. In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by [[electron]]s, and positive charge is carried by the [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[atom]]s. If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter, it will have a negative charge, if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. Charge is ''[[charge quantization|quantized]]''; it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the [[elementary charge]], ''e'', about {{val|1.602|e=-19|u=coulombs}},{{physconst|e|ref=only}} which is the smallest charge which can exist free (particles called [[quark]]s have smaller charges, multiples of {{sfrac|1|3}}''e'', but they are only found in combination, and always combine to form particles with integer charge). The [[proton]] has a charge of +''e'', and the [[electron]] has a charge of \u2212''e''.\n\nElectric charges create an [[electric field]], if they are moving they also generate a [[magnetic field]]. The combination of the electric and magnetic field is called the [[electromagnetic field]], and its interaction with charges is the source of the [[electromagnetic force]], which is one of the four [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in physics. The study of charged particles, and how their interactions are mediated by [[photons]], is called [[quantum electrodynamics]].\n\nThe [[SI derived unit]] of electric charge is the [[coulomb]] (C). In [[electrical engineering]], it is also common to use the [[ampere-hour]] (Ah); in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], it is common to use the elementary charge (''e'' as a unit). Chemistry also uses the [[Faraday constant]] as the charge on a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons. The symbol ''Q'' often denotes charge.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Electric field point lines equipotentials.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram showing field lines and [[equipotential]]s around an [[electron]], a negatively charged particle. In an electrically neutral [[atom]], the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons (which are positively charged), resulting in a net zero overall charge]]\n\nCharge is the fundamental property of forms of matter that exhibit [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many [[charged particle|subatomic particles]]. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge ''e''; we say that electric charge is ''[[charge quantization|quantized]]''. [[Michael Faraday]], in his [[electrolysis]] experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. [[Robert Millikan]]'s [[oil drop experiment]] demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge. It has been discovered that one type of particle, [[quark]]s, have fractional charges of either \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}} or +{{sfrac|2|3}}, but it is believed they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free-standing quarks have never been observed.\n\n[[Convention (norm)|By convention]], the charge of an [[electron]] is negative, ''\u2212e'', while that of a [[proton]] is positive, ''+e''. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. [[Coulomb's law]] quantifies the electrostatic [[force]] between two particles by asserting that the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and [[inverse-square law|inversely proportional to the square]] of the distance between them. The charge of an [[antiparticle]] equals that of the corresponding particle, but with opposite sign.\n\nThe electric charge of a [[macroscopic]] object is the sum of the electric charges of the particles that make it up. This charge is often small, because matter is made of [[atom]]s, and atoms typically have equal numbers of [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s, in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.\n\nAn ''[[ion]]'' is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). ''Monatomic ions'' are formed from single atoms, while ''polyatomic ions'' are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| image1    = VFPt plus thumb.svg\n| alt1      = [[Electric field]] induced by a positive electric charge\n| width1    = 200\n| image2    = VFPt minus thumb.svg\n| alt2      = Electric field induced by a negative electric charge\n| width2    = 200\n| footer    = Electric field induced by a positive electric charge (left) and a field induced by a negative electric charge (right).\n}}\n\nDuring formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral ''ionic compounds'' electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.\n\nSometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as [[static electricity]]. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing [[amber]] with [[fur]] or [[glass]] with [[silk]]. In this way non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of ''[[conservation of charge]]'' always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.\n\nEven when an object's net charge is zero, charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external [[electromagnetic field]], or bound polar molecules). In such cases the object is said to be [[polarization density|polarized]]. The charge due to polarization is known as [[bound charge]], while charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called ''free charge''. The motion of electrons in conductive [[metal]]s in a specific direction is known as [[electric current]].\n\n==Units==\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] derived unit of [[quantity]] of electric charge is the [[coulomb]] (symbol: C). The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that passes through the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of an [[electrical conductor]] carrying one [[ampere]] for one [[second]].<ref name=CIPM1946>{{cite web |url=https://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/1946/2/ |publisher=BIPM |title=CIPM, 1946: Resolution 2}}</ref> This unit was proposed in 1946 and ratified in 1948.<ref name=CIPM1946/> In modern practice, the phrase \"amount of charge\" is used instead of \"quantity of charge\".<ref name=SIBrochure>{{SIbrochure8th}}, p. 150</ref> The amount of charge in 1 electron ([[elementary charge]]) is approximately {{val|1.6|e=-19|u=C}}, and 1 coulomb corresponds to the amount of charge for about {{val|6.24|e=18|u=electrons}}. The symbol ''Q'' is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge. The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an [[electrometer]], or indirectly measured with a [[galvanometer|ballistic galvanometer]].\n\nAfter finding the [[charge quantization|quantized]] character of charge, in 1891 [[George Johnstone Stoney|George Stoney]] proposed the unit 'electron' for this fundamental unit of electrical charge. This was before the discovery of the particle by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as {{em|elementary charge}}, {{em|fundamental unit of charge}}, or simply as {{em|e}}. A measure of charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge ''e'', even if at [[macroscopic scale|large scales]] charge seems to behave as a [[real number|real quantity]]. In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; for example in the charging of a [[capacitor]], or in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].\n\nThe unit [[Faraday constant|faraday]] is sometimes used in electrochemistry.

It is arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative. Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a glass rod after being rubbed with silk.<ref>Roald K. Wangsness (1986) ''Electromagnetic Fields'' (2nd Ed.). Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-81186-6}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the foremost experts on electricity in the 18th century was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who argued in favour of a one-[[fluid theory of electricity]]. Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter; for example, he believed that it was the [[glass]] in a [[Leyden jar]] that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained too little of the fluid it was {{em|negatively}} charged, and when it had an excess it was {{em|positively}} charged. For a reason that was not recorded, he identified the term {{em|positive}} with vitreous electricity and {{em|negative}} with resinous electricity. [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] independently arrived at the same explanation at about the same time (1746).\n\nIt is now known that the Franklin\u2013Watson model was fundamentally correct. There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge.<ref name=\"one-kind\">{{cite web |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/one-kind-of-charge.htm |title=One Kind of Charge |last=Denker |first=John |date=2007 |website=www.av8n.com/physics |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205132208/http://www.av8n.com/physics/one-kind-of-charge.htm |archive-date=2016-02-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> On the other hand, just knowing the charge is not a complete description of the situation. Matter is composed of several kinds of electrically charged particles, and these particles have many properties, not just charge.\n\n==The role of charge in electrostatics==\n{{Confusing section|reason=section title was created in a guess about the intention of this paragraph, maybe this material needs two or more sections|date=April 2018}}\nAll bodies are electrified, but may appear not electrified because of the relatively similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment. An object further electrified + or \u2013 creates an equivalent or opposite charge by default in neighboring objects, until those charges can equalize. The effects of attraction can be observed in high-voltage experiments, while lower voltage effects are merely weaker and therefore less obvious. Coulomb's law has a corollary for acceleration in a gravitational field. See also [[Casimir effect]].\n\n==The role of charge in static electricity==\n[[Static electricity]] refers to the electric charge of an object and the related [[electrostatic discharge]] when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.\n\n===Electrification by friction===\n{{Further|Triboelectric effect}}\n{{Close paraphrasing|section|source=https://archive.org/details/ATreatiseOnElectricityMagnetism-Volume1|free=yes|date=November 2014}}\nWhen a piece of glass and a piece of resin\u2014neither of which exhibit any electrical properties\u2014are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated, they attract each other.\n\nA second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these phenomena:\n*The two pieces of glass repel each other.\n*Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin.\n*The two pieces of resin repel each other.\n\nThis attraction and repulsion is an ''electrical phenomenon'', and the bodies that exhibit them are said to be ''electrified'', or ''electrically charged''. Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by friction. The electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.\n\nIf a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to be ''vitreously'' electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be ''resinously'' electrified. All electrified bodies are either vitreously or resinously electrified.\n\nAn established convention in the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention\u2014just as it is a matter of convention in [[mathematical diagram]] to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.\n\nNo force, either of attraction or of repulsion, can be observed between an electrified body and a body not electrified.<ref>[[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1891) ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', pp. 32\u201333, Dover Publications</ref>\n\n==The role of charge in electric current==\n[[Electric current]] is the flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge. The most common [[charge carriers]] are the positively charged [[proton]] and the negatively charged [[electron]]. The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak of the ''[[conventional current]]'' without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.\n\nAt the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an [[electric current]], including: a flow of electrons; a flow of electron [[electron hole|holes]] that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles ([[ion]]s or other charged particles) flowing in opposite directions in an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[solution]] or a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].\n\nBeware that, in the common and important case of metallic wires, the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the [[drift velocity]] of the actual charge carriers; i.e., the electrons. This is a source of confusion for beginners.\n\n{{Flavour quantum numbers}}\n\n==Conservation of electric charge==<!-- This section is linked from Conservation law (physics) -->\n{{Main|Charge conservation}}\nThe total electric charge of an [[isolated system]] remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from [[gauge invariance]] of the [[wave function]]. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current [[continuity equation]]. More generally, the rate of change in [[charge density]] ''\u03c1'' within a volume of integration ''V'' is equal to the area integral over the [[current density]] '''J''' through the closed surface ''S'' = \u2202''V'', which is in turn equal to the net [[electric current|current]] ''I'':\n:{{oiint|preintegral=<math>- \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_V \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}V = </math>|intsubscpt=<math>\\scriptstyle \\partial V</math>|integrand=<math>\\mathbf J \\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf S = \\int J \\mathrm{d}S \\cos\\theta = I.</math>}}\n\nThus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:\n:<math>I = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe charge transferred between times <math>t_\\mathrm{i}</math> and <math>t_\\mathrm{f}</math> is obtained by integrating both sides:\n:<math>Q = \\int_{t_{\\mathrm{i}}}^{t_{\\mathrm{f}}} I\\, \\mathrm{d}t </math>\nwhere ''I'' is the net outward current through a closed surface and ''Q'' is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.\n\n==Relativistic invariance==\nAside from the properties described in articles about [[electromagnetism]], charge is a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[charge invariance|invariant]]. This means that any particle that has charge ''Q'', no matter how fast it goes, always has charge ''Q''. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of ''one'' [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) is the same as ''two'' [[deuterium]] nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/zna.1999.54.issue-10-11/zna-1999-10-1113/zna-1999-10-1113.pdf|title=Relativistic invariance of electric charge|last= Jefimenko |first=O.D.|date=1999|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung A |volume=54 |issue=10\u201311|pages= 637\u2013644 |doi=10.1515/zna-1999-10-1113|access-date=11 April 2018|bibcode=1999ZNatA..54..637J}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/248688/how-can-we-prove-charge-invariance-under-lorentz-transformation|title=How can we prove charge invariance under Lorentz Transformation?|website=physics.stackexchange.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=1992|last=Singal|first=A.K.|title=On the charge invariance and relativistic electric fields from a steady conduction current|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019290982R|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=162|issue=2|pages=91\u201395|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(92)90982-R|issn=0375-9601|bibcode=1992PhLA..162...91S}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[SI electromagnetism units]]\n*[[Color charge]]\n*[[Partial charge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131005012550/http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/2000/marapril/mrstatic.html How fast does a charge decay?]\n*[http://seaus.free.fr/spip.php?article964 History of the electrical units.]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n[[Category:Conservation laws]]\n[[Category:Electric charge| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n[[Category:Electrostatics|*]]\n[[Category:Flavour (particle physics)]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Spintronics]]", "sha1": "oertc7uu304x280grksxe4n4v5uv8d0"}}, {"title": "Electric Charge", "ns": "0", "id": "9805", "redirect": {"title": "Electric charge"}, "revision": {"id": "783862338", "parentid": "290580107", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:47:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Electric charge]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "p9ix3cuofq21dn9sotdcf44imkq3hnx"}}, {"title": "Ellis Island", "ns": "0", "id": "9806", "revision": {"id": "866518325", "parentid": "865479410", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T20:44:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kkmurray", "id": "346608"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Spelling/grammar correction", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox Historic Site\n| name =  Ellis Island\n| image = [[File:EllisIsland-LibertyState2017.tif|frameless|center|upright=1.35]]\n| caption = Aerial image of Ellis Island\n| elevation = {{convert|7|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Ellis Island -

[[Artesian aquifer|Artesian wells]] were dug, and fill material was hauled in from incoming ships' [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] and from construction of New York City's [[Rapid transit|subway]] tunnels, which doubled the size of Ellis Island to over six acres. While the building was under construction, the Barge Office nearby at the [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery]] was used for immigrant processing.\n\nThe first station was a three-story-tall structure with outbuildings, built of [[Pinus palustris|Georgia Pine]], containing the amenities thought to be necessary. It opened with fanfare on January 1, 1892.<ref name=\"Ellis Island Foundation, 2000\"/> Three large ships landed on the first day, and 700 [[Immigration|immigrants]] passed over the docks. Almost 450,000 immigrants were processed at the station during its first year. On June 15, 1897, a fire of unknown origin, possibly caused by faulty wiring, turned the wooden structures on Ellis Island into ashes. No loss of life was reported, but most of the immigration records dating back to 1855 were destroyed.

In 1913, writer [[Louis Adamic]] came to America from [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and described the night he and many other immigrants slept on bunk beds in a huge hall. Lacking a warm blanket, the young man \"shivered, sleepless, all night, listening to snores\" and dreams \"in perhaps a dozen different languages\". The facility was so large that the dining room could seat 1,000 people.

Arrivals were asked 29 questions including name, occupation, and the amount of money carried. It was important to the American government the new arrivals could support themselves and have money to get started. The average the government wanted the immigrants to have was between 18 and 25 dollars ($600 in 2015 adjusted for inflation). Those with visible health problems or diseases were sent home or held in the island's [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital|hospital facilities]] for long periods of time. More than 3,000 would-be immigrants died on Ellis Island while being held in the hospital facilities. Some unskilled workers were rejected because they were considered \"likely to become a public charge.\" About 2% were denied admission to the U.S. and sent back to their countries of origin for reasons such as having a chronic contagious disease, criminal background, or insanity.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/stli/serv02.htm#Ellis National Park Service: Ellis Island], retrieved 2006-01-12.</ref> Ellis Island was sometimes known as \"The Island of Tears\" or \"Heartbreak Island\"<ref>Davis, Kenneth (2003), ''Don't Know Much About American History'', HarperTrophy, {{ISBN|0-06-440836-1}} (\"Isle of Tears\" or \"Heartbreak Island\", p. 123)</ref> because of those 2% who were not admitted after the long transatlantic voyage.

It was the nation's largest marine hospital. Uniformed military surgeons staffed the medical division, which was active in the hospital wards, the Barge Office at the Battery and the Main Building. They are best known for the role they played during the line inspection, in which they employed unusual techniques such as the use of the [[wikt:buttonhook|buttonhook]] to examine immigrants for signs of eye diseases (particularly, [[trachoma]]) and the use of a chalk mark code. Symbols were chalked on the clothing of potentially sick immigrants following the six-second medical examination. The doctors would look at the immigrants as they climbed the stairs from the baggage area to the Great Hall. Immigrants' behavior would be studied for difficulties in getting up the staircase. Some immigrants supposedly entered the country by surreptitiously wiping the chalk marks off, or by turning their clothes inside out.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ellis Island: A Primary Source History of an Immigrant's Arrival in America |last=Houghton |first=Gillian |year=2003 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, New York}}</ref>\n\nThe symbols used were:\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n* '''B''' \u2013 [[Back]]\n* '''C''' \u2013 [[Conjunctivitis]]\n* '''TC''' \u2013 [[Trachoma]]\n* '''E''' \u2013 [[Human eye|Eyes]]\n* '''F''' \u2013 [[Face]]\n* '''FT''' \u2013 [[Foot|Feet]]\n* '''G''' \u2013 [[Goiter]]\n* '''H''' \u2013 [[Human heart|Heart]]\n* '''K''' \u2013 [[Hernia]]\n* '''L''' \u2013 [[Lameness]]\n* '''N''' \u2013 [[Neck]]\n* '''P''' \u2013 [[Physical examination|Physical]] and [[Lungs]]\n* '''PG''' \u2013 [[Pregnancy]]\n* '''S''' \u2013 [[Senility]]\n* '''SC''' \u2013 [[Scalp]] ([[Favus]])\n* '''X''' \u2013 Suspected [[Mental disorder|Mental defect]]\n* '''\u24e7''' \u2013 Definite signs of Mental defect\n{{div col end}}\n\nU.S. Immigrant Inspectors used some other symbols or marks as they interrogated immigrants in the Registry Room to determine whether to admit or detain them, including:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n* '''SI''' \u2013 Special [[Inquiry]]\n* '''IV''' \u2013 Immigrant [[Visa (document)|Visa]]\n* '''LPC''' \u2013 Likely or Liable to become a Public Charge\n* '''Med.

This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to [[New Comedy|comedy]], some of which are characteristic of [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]].

Whereas Socrates was eventually put on trial and executed as a corrupting influence, Euripides chose a voluntary exile in old age, dying in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].<ref name=\"Denys L.

Upon the receipt of an oracle saying that his son was fated to win \"crowns of victory\", Mnesarchus insisted that the boy should train for a career in athletics. In fact the boy was destined for a career on the stage, where however he was to win only five victories, one of which was after his death. He served for a short time as both dancer and torch-bearer at the rites of [[Apollo]] Zosterius. His education was not confined to athletics: he also studied painting and philosophy under the masters [[Prodicus]] and [[Anaxagoras]]. He had two disastrous marriages and both his wives{{emdash}}Melite and Choerine (the latter bearing him three sons){{emdash}}were unfaithful. He became a recluse, making a home for himself in a cave on Salamis ([[The Cave of Euripides]], where a cult of the playwright developed after his death). \"There he built an impressive library and pursued daily communion with the sea and sky\". Eventually he retired to the \"rustic court\" of King Archelaus in Macedonia, where he died in 406 BC.<ref>Mary Ellen Snodgrass, ''Cliff Notes on Greek Classics'', Wiley Publishing Inc. (1998), pp. 147\u201348</ref> However, as mentioned in the introduction, biographical details such as these should be regarded with scepticism. They are derived almost entirely from three unreliable sources:<ref name=\"GJ 252\">Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 252</ref>\n* folklore, employed by the ancients to lend colour to the lives of celebrated authors;\n* parody, employed by contemporary comic poets to ridicule tragic poets;\n* 'autobiographical' clues gleaned from his extant plays (a mere fraction of his total output).\nThis biography is divided into three sections corresponding to the three kinds of sources.\n[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Euripides, [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].]]\n\n===A fabled life===\nEuripides was the youngest in a set of three great tragedians who were almost contemporaries: his first play was staged thirteen years after Sophocles' debut and only three years after Aeschylus's masterpiece, the ''[[Oresteia]]''. The identity of the threesome is neatly underscored by a patriotic account of their roles during Greece's great victory over [[Ancient Persia|Persia]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]]{{emdash}}Aeschylus fought there, Sophocles was just old enough to celebrate the victory in a boys' chorus and Euripides was born on the very day of the battle.<ref name=\"GJ 252\"/> The apocryphal account that he composed his works in a cave on Salamis island was a late tradition and it probably symbolizes the isolation of an intellectual who was rather ahead of his time.<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 317</ref> Much of his life and his whole career coincided with the struggle between Athens and Sparta for hegemony in Greece but he didn't live to see the final defeat of his city. It is said that he died in Macedonia after being attacked by the Molossian hounds of King Archelaus and that his cenotaph near [[Piraeus]] was struck by lightning{{emdash}}signs of his unique powers, whether for good or ill (according to one modern scholar, his death might have been caused instead by the harsh Macedonian winter).<ref>Richard Rutherford, ''Medea and Other Plays''. By Euripides, Introduction. Rev ed. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-044929-9}}.</ref> In an account by [[Plutarch]], the catastrophic failure of the [[Sicilian expedition]] led Athenians to trade renditions of Euripides' lyrics to their enemies in return for food and drink (''Life of Nicias'' 29). Plutarch is the source also for the story that the victorious Spartan generals, having planned the demolition of Athens and the enslavement of its people, grew merciful after being entertained at a banquet by lyrics from Euripides' play ''Electra'': \"they felt that it would be a barbarous act to annihilate a city which produced such men\" (''Life of Lysander'').<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Lysander'', cited and translated by B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 337</ref>\n\n===A comic life===\nTragic poets were often mocked by comic poets during the dramatic festivals [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]], and Euripides was travestied more than most. Aristophanes scripted him as a character in at least three plays: ''[[The Acharnians]]'', ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' and ''[[The Frogs]]''. Yet Aristophanes borrowed rather than just satirized some of the tragedian's methods; he was once ridiculed by a colleague, [[Cratinus]], as \"a hair-splitting master of niceties, a ''Euripidaristophanist''\".<ref>David Barrett and Alan Sommerstein (eds), ''The Birds and Other Plays by Aristophanes'', Penguin Classics 2003, p. 9</ref> According to another comic poet, [[Teleclides]], the plays of Euripides were co-authored by the philosopher Socrates.<ref>Duane Reed Stuart, ''Epochs and Greek and Roman Biography'', Biblo and Tannen Booksellers and Publishers' Inc. (1928), p. 174</ref> According to Aristophanes, the alleged co-author was a celebrated actor, Cephisophon, who also shared the tragedian's house and his wife,<ref>Alan H. Sommerstein, ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'', Penguin Books (1973), note 35, p. 241</ref> while Socrates taught an entire school of quibblers like Euripides:\n{{quote|<poem>\nThey sit at the feet of Socrates\nTill they can't distinguish the wood from the trees,\n           And tragedy goes to POT;\nThey don't care whether their plays are art\nBut only whether the words are smart;\nThey waste our time with quibbles and quarrels,\nDestroying our patience as well as our morals,\n           And making us all talk ROT.<ref>David Barret (trans.), ''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' (1964), p. 211</ref>\n</poem>}}\nIn ''The Frogs'', composed after Euripides and Aeschylus were both dead, Aristophanes imagines the god [[Dionysus]] venturing down to [[Hades]] in search of a good poet to bring back to Athens. After a debate between the two deceased bards, the god brings Aeschylus back to life as more useful to Athens on account of his wisdom, rejecting Euripides as merely clever. Such comic 'evidence' suggests that Athenians admired Euripides even while they mistrusted his intellectualism, at least during the long war with Sparta. Aeschylus had written his own epitaph commemorating his life as a warrior fighting for Athens against Persia, without any mention of his success as a playwright, and Sophocles was celebrated by his contemporaries for his social gifts and contributions to public life as a state official, but there are no records of Euripides' public life except as a dramatist{{emdash}}he could well have been \"a brooding and bookish recluse\".<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, p. viii</ref> He is presented as such in ''The Acharnians'', where Aristophanes shows him to be living morosely in a precarious house, surrounded by the tattered costumes of his disreputable characters (and yet [[Agathon]], another tragic poet, is discovered in a later play, ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'', to be living in circumstances almost as bizarre). Euripides' mother was a humble vendor of vegetables, according to the comic tradition, yet his plays indicate that he had a liberal education and hence a privileged background.<ref name=\"GJ 252\"/>\n\n===A tragedian's life===\nEuripides first competed in the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]], the famous Athenian dramatic festival, in 455 BC, one year after the death of [[Aeschylus]], and it was not until 441 BC that he won a first prize. His final competition in Athens was in 408 BC. ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' were performed after his death in 405 BC and first prize was awarded posthumously. Altogether his plays won first prize only five times.\n\nHis plays and those of Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate a difference in outlook between the three men{{emdash}}a generation gap probably due to the [[Sophism|Sophistic enlightenment]] in the middle decades of the 5th century: Aeschylus still looked back to the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], Sophocles was in transition between periods, and Euripides was fully imbued with the new spirit of the [[Classical Greece|classical age]].<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), pp. 316\u201317</ref> When Euripides' plays are sequenced in time, they also reveal that his outlook might have changed, providing a \"spiritual biography\" along these lines:\n* an early period of high tragedy (''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'')\n* a patriotic period at the outset of the Peloponnesian War (''[[Children of Heracles]]'', ''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]]'')\n* a middle period of disillusionment at the senselessness of war (''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[The Trojan Women]]'')\n* an escapist period with a focus on romantic intrigue (''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'')\n* a final period of tragic despair (''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'', ''[[Phoenician Women]]'', ''[[The Bacchae]]'')\nHowever, about 80% of his plays have been lost and even the extant plays do not present a fully consistent picture of his 'spiritual' development (for example, ''Iphigenia at Aulis'' is dated with the 'despairing' ''Bacchae'', yet it contains elements that became typical of New Comedy).<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P.

Believed to have been composed in the wilds of Macedonia, ''Bacchae'' also happens to dramatize a primitive side to Greek religion and some modern scholars have therefore interpreted this particular play biographically as:\n* a kind of death-bed conversion or renunciation of atheism;\n* the poet's attempt to ward off the charge of impiety that was later to overtake his friend Socrates;\n* evidence of a new belief that religion cannot be analysed rationally.<ref>E.R.Dodds, ''Euripides: Bacchae'', Oxford University Press (1960), Introduction p. xl</ref>\nOne of his earliest extant plays, ''Medea'', includes a speech that he seems to have written in defence of himself as an intellectual ahead of his time, though he has put it in the mouth of the play's heroine:<ref name=\"Denys L.

The state funded it and awarded prizes to the winners. The language was spoken and sung verse, the performance area included a circular floor or [[orchestra]] where the chorus could dance, a space for actors (three speaking actors in Euripides' time), a backdrop or [[wikt:skene|skene]] and some special effects: an [[ekkyklema]] (used to bring the skene's \"indoors\" outdoors) and a [[mechane]] (used to lift actors in the air, as in [[deus ex machina]]). With the introduction of the third actor (an innovation attributed to Sophocles), acting also began to be regarded as a skill to be rewarded with prizes, requiring a long apprenticeship in the chorus. Euripides and other playwrights accordingly composed more and more arias for accomplished actors to sing and this tendency becomes more marked in his later plays:<ref>John Gould, 'Tragedy in performance', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P.

Thus, for example, [[Odysseus]] is represented in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'' (lines 131\u201332) as \"agile-minded, sweet-talking, demos-pleasing\" i.e., a type of the war-time demagogues that were active in Athens during the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>Justina Gregory, \"Euripidean Tragedy\", in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.)

His comic touches can be thought to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism: \"The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic statement\".<ref>Bernd Seidensticker, \"Dithyramb, Comedy and Satyr-Play', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), pp. 52\u201333</ref> Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so suddenly that inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics,<ref>B.M.Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P.

Knox, 'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 332</ref> Similarly his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines theatrical illusion. Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a monologue in which a divinity or human character directly and simply tells the audience all it needs to know in order to understand the subsequent action.<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), p. xvi</ref>\n\nAeschylus and Sophocles were innovative, but Euripides had arrived at a position in the \"ever-changing genre\" where he could move easily between tragic, comic, romantic and political effects, a versatility that appears in individual plays and also over the course of his career. Potential for comedy lay in his use of 'contemporary' characters, in his sophisticated tone, his relatively informal Greek (see [[Euripides#In Greek|In Greek]] below), and in his ingenious use of plots centred on motifs that later became standard in Menander's New Comedy, such as the 'recognition scene'. Other tragedians also used recognition scenes but they were heroic in emphasis, as in Aeschylus's ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'', which Euripides parodied with his mundane treatment of it in ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'' (Euripides was unique among the tragedians in incorporating theatrical criticism in his plays).<ref>Justina Gregory, ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 267</ref> Traditional myth, with its exotic settings, heroic adventures and epic battles, offered potential for romantic melodrama as well as for political comments on a war theme,<ref>B.&nbsp;M.

Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), pp. 332\u201366</ref> so that his plays are an extraordinary mix of elements. ''The Trojan Women'' for example is a powerfully disturbing play on the theme of war's horrors, apparently critical of Athenian imperialism (it was composed in the aftermath of the [[Melos#Conflict with Athens|Melian massacre]] and during the preparations for the [[Sicilian Expedition]])<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), p. 195</ref> yet it features the comic exchange between Menelaus and Hecuba quoted above and the chorus considers Athens, the \"blessed land of Theus\", to be a desirable refuge{{emdash}}such complexity and ambiguity are typical both of his \"patriotic\" and \"anti-war\" plays.<ref>B.&nbsp;M.

The few extant fragments of satyr-plays attributed to Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate that these were a loosely structured, simple and jovial form of entertainment. However, in ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' (the only complete satyr-play that survives) Euripides structured the entertainment more like a tragedy and introduced a note of critical irony typical of his other work. His genre-bending inventiveness is shown above all in ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', a blend of tragic and satyric elements. This fourth play in his tetralogy for 438 BC (i.e., it occupied the position conventionally reserved for satyr-plays) is a \"tragedy\" that features [[Heracles]] as a satyric hero in conventional satyr-play scenes, involving an arrival, a banquet, a victory over an [[ogre]] (in this case, Death), a happy ending, a feast and a departure to new adventures.<ref>Bernd Seidensticker, \"Dithyramb, Comedy and Satyr-Play', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 50</ref> Most of the big innovations in tragedy were made by Aeschylus and Sophocles and yet \"Euripides made innovations on a smaller scale that have impressed some critics as cumulatively leading to a radical change of direction\".<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 269</ref>\n\n=== In Greek ===\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 031.jpg|thumb|right|''Medea About to Murder Her Children'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix]] (1862)]]\n\nThe spoken language of the plays is not fundamentally different in style from that of Aeschylus or Sophocles{{emdash}}it employs [[poetic meter]]s, a rarefied vocabulary, fullness of expression, complex syntax, and ornamental figures, all aimed at representing an elevated style.<ref>Justina Gregory, \"Euripidean Tragedy\", in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 256</ref> However, its rhythms are somewhat freer and more natural than that of his predecessors, and the vocabulary has been expanded to allow for intellectual and psychological subtleties.

Summaries of the transmission are often found in modern editions of the plays, three of which are used as sources for this summary<ref group=\"nb\">This summary of the transmission is adapted from a) Denys L.

However, literary conventions that we take for granted today had not yet been invented{{emdash}}there was no spacing between words, no consistency in punctuation nor in vowel elisions, no marks for breathings and accent (guides to pronunciation and hence word recognition), no convention to denote change of speaker and no stage directions, and verse was written straight across the page like prose. Possibly those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as the equivalent of the modern dash, colon and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions, which are an aid to comprehension, was an early and persistent source of errors affecting transmission of the text. Errors crept in also when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403\u2013402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by [[Lycurgus of Athens]] in 330 BC \"...that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal.\"<ref>Plutarch ''Vit.Dec.Orat.'' 851e, cited by Denys L.

It was about then that [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was \"published\" separately. This became the \"standard edition\" for the future and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expect{{emdash}}there was still no spacing between words, little or no punctuation and no stage directions, but abbreviated names now denoted changes of speaker, lyrics are broken into \"cola' and \"strophai\" or lines and stanzas, and a system of accentuation was introduced.\n[[File:Medea-fragment-4th-5th-CE.gif|thumb|right|Fragment of a [[vellum]] [[codex]] from the 4th\u20135th centuries AD, showing choral anapaests from ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', lines 1087\u201391.

(reprint 1978), note 1087\u201389, p. 151)</ref>]]\nAfter this creation of a standard edition, the text was fairly safe from errors, apart from the slight and gradual corruption produced by the tedium of frequent copying. Many of these trivial errors occurred in the Byzantine period, following a change in script from [[uncial]] to [[Minuscule Greek|minuscule]], and many were \"homophonic\" errors, when scribes accidentally substituted homophones for words in the text{{emdash}}equivalent in English to substituting \"right\" for \"write\", except that there were more opportunities for Byzantine scribes to make these errors because the Greek letters \u03b7, \u03b9, \u03bf\u03b9 and \u03b5\u03b9 were pronounced similarly in the Byzantine period.\n\nAround 200 AD, ten of the plays of Euripides began to be circulated in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or [[scholia]] recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophocles{{emdash}}the only plays of theirs that survive today.<ref>Denys L. Page, ''Euripides: Medea'', Oxford University Press (1976), Introduction p. xlii</ref> Euripides however was more fortunate than the other tragedians in the survival of a second edition of his work, compiled in alphabetical order as if from a set of his collect works, but without scholia attached. This \"Alphabetical\" edition was combined with the \"Select\" edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that survive today. The \"Select\" plays are found in many medieval manuscripts but only two manuscripts preserve the \"Alphabetical\" plays{{emdash}}often denoted L and P, after the [[Laurentian Library]] at Florence, and the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of L, but the remainder is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is missing ''The Trojan Women'' and latter part of ''The Bacchae''.\n\nIn addition to L, P and many other medieval manuscripts, there are also fragments of plays recorded on papyrus. The papyrus fragments are often recovered only through modern technology. In June 2005, for example, classicists at [[Oxford University]] worked on a joint project with [[Brigham Young University]], using multi-spectral imaging technology to retrieve previously illegible writing (see References). Some of this work employed [[infrared]] technology\u2014previously used for [[satellite]] imaging\u2014to detect previously unknown material by Euripides in fragments of the [[Oxyrhynchus papyri]], a collection of ancient manuscripts held by the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/news/independent.html |title=POxy Oxyrhynchus Online |publisher=Papyrology.ox.ac.uk |date=17 April 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Papyrology Websites |publisher=Papyrology.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt is from such materials that modern scholars try to piece together copies of the original plays. Sometimes the picture is almost lost. Thus for example two extant plays, ''The Phoenician Women'' and ''Iphigenia at Aulis'', are significantly corrupted by interpolations<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 259</ref> (the latter possibly being completed post mortem by the poet's son) and the very authorship of ''Rhesus'' is a matter of dispute.<ref>William Ritchie, ''The Authenticity of the Rhesus of Euripides'', Cambridge University Press (1964)</ref> In fact, the very existence of the Alphabet plays, or rather the absence of an equivalent edition for Sophocles and Aeschylus, could distort our notions of distinctive Euripidean qualities{{emdash}}most of his least \"tragic\" plays are in the Alphabet edition and possibly the other two tragedians would appear just as genre-bending as this \"restless experimenter\" if we possessed more than their \"select\" editions.<ref name=\"Justina Gregory 2005 page 254\">Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 254</ref>\n\n''See [[Euripides#Extant plays|Extant plays]] below for listing of \"Select\" and \"Alphabetical\" plays.''\n\n===Chronology===\nThe original production dates of some of Euripides' plays are known from ancient records, such as lists of prize-winners at the [[Dionysia]], and approximations are obtained for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were travestied by comic poets such as [[Aristophanes]], the known dates of whose own plays thus serve as a [[terminus ad quem]] for those of Euripides, though sometimes the gap can be considerable (e.g. twenty-seven years separate ''Telephus'', known to have been produced in 438 BC, from its parody in ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' in 411 BC.) References in Euripides' plays to contemporary events provide a [[terminus ad quem|terminus a quo]], though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g. lines 1074\u201389 in ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' describe a procession to [[Eleusis]], which was probably written before the Spartans occupied it during the [[Peloponnesian War]]).<ref>A.S. Owen, ''Euripides: Ion'', Bristol Classical Press, Introduction pp. xl\u2013xli</ref> Other indications of dating are obtained by [[stylometry]] and this section therefore is an appropriate place to consider some aspects of his style as a Greek poet.\n\nGreek tragedy comprised lyric and dialogue, the latter mostly in [[iambic trimeter]] (three pairs of [[iamb (foot)|iambic feet]] per line). Euripides sometimes 'resolved' the two syllables of the iamb (\u02d8\u00af) into three syllables (\u02d8\u02d8\u02d8) and this tendency increased so steadily over time that the number of resolved feet in a play can be understood to indicate the approximate date of composition (see [[Euripides#Extant plays|Extant plays]] below for one scholar's list of resolutions per hundred trimeters). Associated with this increase in resolutions was an increasing vocabulary for tragic dialogue, often involving prefixes to refine meanings, allowing the language to assume a more natural rhythm while also becoming ever more capable of psychological and philosophical subtlety.<ref>B. Knox,'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 337</ref>\n\nThe trochaic tetrameter catalectic{{emdash}}four pairs of [[trochee]]s per line, with the final syllable omitted{{emdash}}was identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (''Poetics'' 1449a21). Euripides however employs it here and there in his later plays.<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 257</ref> He seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, ''The Trojan Women'' being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play\u2014it is symptomatic of a curious archaizing tendency evident in his later works.<ref>M. Platnauer, ''Iphigenia in Tauris'', Oxford University Press (1938), Introduction page 14</ref><ref>E.R.Dodds, ''Euripides: Bacchae'', Oxford University Press (1960), Introduction p. xxxvi</ref>\n\nThe later plays also feature extensive use of [[stichomythia]] (i.e. a series of one-liners).<ref>John Gould, 'Tragedy in performance' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 281</ref> The longest such scene comprises one hundred and five lines in ''Ion'' (lines 264\u2013369). In contrast, Aeschylus never exceeded twenty lines of stichomythia; Sophocles' longest such scene was fifty lines and it is interrupted several times by \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae (''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', lines 1176\u20131226).<ref>A.S. Owen, ''Euripides: Ion'', Bristol Classical Press (1990), Introduction p. 91</ref>\n\nEuripides' use of lyrics in the sung portion of his work shows the influence of [[Timotheus of Miletus]] in the later plays{{emdash}} the individual singer gained prominence and was given additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets between actors, as well as replacing some of the chorus's functions with monodies. At the same time, choral odes begin to take on something of the form of [[dithyrambs]] reminiscent of the poetry of [[Bacchylides]], featuring elaborate treatment of myths.<ref>Justina Gregory, 'Euripidean Tragedy', in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', Justina Gregory (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd (2005), p. 258</ref> Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The ''Bacchae'' however shows a reversion to old forms,<ref>B. Knox,'Euripides' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 338</ref> possibly as a deliberate archaic effect or maybe because there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia, where it is said to have been written.<ref>Moses Hadas, ''Ten Plays by Euripides'', Bantam Classic (2006), Introduction, p. xvi</ref>\n\n===Extant plays===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Estimated chronological order\n!

She was the younger sister of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] and the fifth of six children. In 1820, shortly after the birth of Emily's younger sister [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], the family moved eight miles away to [[Haworth]], where Patrick was employed as [[perpetual curate]]; here the children developed their literary talents.<ref name=\"Fraser 16\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 16</ref>\n\nAfter the death of their mother on 15 September 1821 from cancer, when Emily was three years old,<ref name=\"Fraser 28\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 28</ref> the older sisters [[Maria Bront\u00eb|Maria]], Elizabeth and Charlotte were sent to the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School]] at Cowan Bridge, where they encountered abuse and privations later described by Charlotte in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. At the age of six on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period.<ref name=\"Fraser 35\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 35</ref> When a [[typhoid]] epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth caught it. Maria, who may actually have had [[tuberculosis]], was sent home, where she died. Emily was subsequently removed from the school, in June 1825, along with Charlotte and Elizabeth. Elizabeth died soon after their return home.<ref name=\" Fraser 31\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 31</ref>\n\nThe three remaining sisters and their brother [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Patrick Branwell]] were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt [[Elizabeth Branwell]], their mother's sister. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, being especially noted for befriending the stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 20.</ref> Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''.<ref name=\"Fraser 44-45\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\n[[File:Gondal Poems.jpg|thumb|179 px|Emily's [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]] poems]]\n\nIn their leisure time the children began to write fiction at home, inspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift<ref>Richard E. Mezo, ''A Student's Guide to Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb'' (2002), p. 1</ref> and created a number of [[paracosm|fantasy worlds]] (including 'Angria') which  featured in stories they wrote \u2013 all \"very strange ones\" according to Charlotte<ref name=\"Gaskell 91\">Gaskell, ''The  Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'', pp. 91</ref> \u2013 and [[storytelling game|enacted]] about the imaginary adventures of their toy soldiers along with the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and his sons, [[Lord Charles Wellesley|Charles]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]].

With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and place-names, the writings on Gondal were not preserved. Some \"diary papers\" of Emily's have survived in which she describes current events in Gondal, some of which were written, others enacted with Anne. One dates from 1841, when Emily was twenty-three: another from 1845, when she was twenty-seven.<ref>[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/diary_papers#diary \"Emily Bront\u00eb's Letters and Diary Papers\"], City University of New York</ref> The heroes of Gondal resemble the popular image of the Highlanders of Scotland as a sort of British version of the \"noble savage\", being romantic outlaws who were capable of more romanticism, nobility, passion and bravery than those from \"civilization\".{{sfn|Austin|p=578}} One of the fictional works produced by the Bront\u00eb siblings was Branwell's ''The Life of Alexander Percy'', which tells the story of how he and his wife have such a complete love and understanding for one another that eventually their love becomes self-destructive.<ref name=\"Paddock p. 199\">Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 199.</ref> Her brother's story was to become the inspiration for ''Wuthering Heights''.<ref name=\"Paddock p. 199\"/>\n\nAt seventeen, Emily attended the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher but managed to stay only a few months before being overcome by extreme [[homesickness]]. Charlotte later stated that: \"Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring...

Unlike Charlotte, Emily felt uncomfortable in Brussels, and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying \"I wish to be as God made me\", which made her into something of an outcast.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 21.</ref> The sisters planned to perfect their French and German in anticipation of opening their school. Nine of Emily's French essays survive from this period. H\u00e9ger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily's character, and made the following assertion:\n<blockquote><div>\nShe should have been a man \u2013 a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.<ref>[[Constantin H\u00e9ger]], 1842, referring to Emily Bront\u00eb, as quoted in ''The Oxford History of the Novel in English'' (2011), Volume 3, p. 208</ref>\n</div></blockquote>\nThe two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had attained such competence in French that Madame H\u00e9ger made a proposal for both to stay another half-year, even offering to dismiss the English master, according to Charlotte, so that she could take his place, while Emily was to teach music as she had by that time become a competent piano teacher.<ref>{{cite book|author=Norma Crandall|title=Emily Bront\u00eb, a Psychological Portrait|publisher=R.

One was labelled \"Gondal Poems\"; the other was unlabelled.

Emily, furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused, but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well.

The Bront\u00eb sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: Charlotte was \"Currer Bell\", Emily was \"Ellis Bell\" and Anne was \"Acton Bell\".<ref>''Encyclopedia of British writers, 19th century'' (2009), p. 41</ref> Charlotte wrote in the 'Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell' that their \"ambiguous choice\" was \"dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice\".<ref name=\"Gaskell 335\">Gaskell, ''The life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'' (1857), p. 335</ref> Charlotte contributed 19 poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold,<ref>Winifred G\u00e9rin, ''Charlotte Bront\u00eb: the evolution of genius'' (1969), p. 322</ref> they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs).<ref>Margot Peters, ''Unquiet Soul: A Biography of Charlotte Bront\u00eb'' (1976), p. 219</ref> ''The Athenaeum'' reviewer praised Ellis Bell's work for its music and power, singling out his poems as the best: \"Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted\",<ref>''In the footsteps of the Bront\u00ebs'' (1895), p. 306</ref> and ''The Critic'' reviewer recognised \"the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect.\"<ref>''The poems of Emily Jane Bront\u00eb and Anne Bront\u00eb'' (1932), p. 102</ref>\n\n==Personality and character==\n[[Image:Emily Bront\u00eb cropped.jpg|thumb|Disputed portrait made by [[Branwell Bront\u00eb]] about 1833; sources are in disagreement over whether this image is of Emily or Anne.<ref name=\"Portrait\" />]]\nEmily Bront\u00eb remains a mysterious figure and a challenge to biographers because information about her is sparse<ref>Lorna Sage ''The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English'' (1999), p. 90</ref> due to her solitary and reclusive nature.<ref>U.

Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were \"like twins\", \"inseparable companions\" and \"in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption\".<ref name=\"Fraser 39\">Fraser, ''A Life of Anne Bront\u00eb'', p. 39</ref><ref name=\"Barker 195\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 195</ref> In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] fell through and instead the sisters went to [[York]] where Anne showed Emily [[York Minster]]. During the trip the sisters acted out some of their Gondal characters.<ref name=\"Barker 451\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 451</ref>\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly about her shortly after her death, she is not a neutral witness. [[Stevie Davies]] believes that there is what might be called Charlotte's smoke-screen and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have doubted her sister's sanity.

These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly\u2014for example in response to sudden [[global warming]] or a sudden drop in sea level or even [[earthquake]]s.

Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent which includes the vast majority of Earth's land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of [[continental shelf]] (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations.\n\nAnother theory is that the creation of the super-continent [[Pangaea]] contributed to the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]] mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the \"Marine genus diversity\" diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the \"Big Five\" if it were not overshadowed by the \"Great Dying\" at the end of the Permian.<ref>{{cite web |title=Speculated Causes of the Permian Extinction |publisher=Hooper Virtual Paleontological Museum |url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/permcause.html |accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Other hypotheses====\nMany other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded.\n\nScientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss.

The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery, as well as prolonged environmental stress which continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction;<ref name=\"LehrmannRamezanBowring2006TimingOfRecovery\">{{cite journal | title=Timing of recovery from the end-Permian extinction: Geochronologic and biostratigraphic constraints from south China | author=Lehrmann | journal=Geology |date=December 2006 | volume=34 | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/12/1053 | pages=1053\u20131056 | doi=10.1130/G22827A.1 | issue=12 |bibcode = 2006Geo....34.1053L | author2=D.J. | author3=Ramezan | author4=J. | author5=Bowring | author6=S.A. | display-authors=6 | last7=Payne | first7=Jonathan L. | last8=Orchard | first8=Michael J. | last9=Hongmei | first9=Wang }}</ref> and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-T extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.<ref name=\"SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction\">{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759 | author1=Sahney, S.|author2= Benton, M.J. |authorlink2= Michael Benton| year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759\u201365 | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}</ref>  Subsequent to the P-T extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges \u2013 perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.<ref name=\"Sidor2013\">{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1302323110  | title = Provincialization of terrestrial faunas following the end-Permian mass extinction  | year = 2013  | last1 = Sidor | first1 = C.

He lived nearby in the Seaton Place Apartments with his wife, [[Lee Hawkins Garby]]. A long discussion about journeys into outer space ensued, and it was suggested that Smith should write down his ideas and speculations as a story about interstellar travel. Although he was interested, Smith believed that some thought that some [[romantic fiction|romantic]] elements would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.\n\nMrs. Garby offered to take care of the love interest and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give it a try. The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the \"Seatons\" and \"Cranes\" were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively.<ref>Sanders pp. 8\u20139, Moskowitz p. 14.</ref> About one third of ''[[The Skylark of Space]]'' was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.\n\nSmith earned his master's degree in chemistry from the [[George Washington University]] in 1917, studying under Dr. [[Charles Edward Munroe|Charles E.

Moskowitz says that the outline was 80 pages; Smith only mentions that the section on ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'' was \"only a few pages long.\"</ref> Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends; Smith cites [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] as a negative example.<ref name=\"epic85\">\"The Epic of Space\" p. 85.</ref> After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'', plus a detailed graph of its structure, with \"peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material.\" He notes, however, that he was never able to follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the \"characters get away from me and do exactly as they damn please.\"<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 86.</ref> After completing the rough draft of ''Galactic Patrol'', he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, ''[[Children of the Lens]].''<ref name = \"mosk19\"/> ''Galactic Patrol'' was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of ''Astounding''; unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as ''Triplanetary''.<ref>The Commandant's account of the Patrol's early history at the beginning of the magazine version of ''Galactic Patrol'' does not describe what happened in the magazine version of ''Triplanetary''; the reference to Virgil Samms and the Triplanetary Patrol is a later interpolation. (''Astounding'' September 1937 pp. 12\u201313; cp. [[Fantasy Press]] edition pp. 8\u20139.) The reference to \"the days of the semi-inert drive\" and the Third Galactic Survey on page 34 of the same issue is not consistent with the history of partial inertialessness in either version of ''Triplanetary'', and is omitted from page 42 of the [[Fantasy Press]] edition. (''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'' March 1934 pp. 28 & 33; cp. Fantasy Press edition pp. 223 & 231.) See also Gharlane's Lens FAQ Question 1.

(Note that the frequent British spelling \"grey\" is simply a recurrent mistake, starting with the cover of the first installment; Moskowitz's usage, ''\"The Grey Lensman\",'' is even harder to justify.<ref>Gharlane Lens FAQ Question 1 and footnote to rec.arts.sf.written [https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written/msg/59129aa183783b05 posting]; Moskowitz p. 20.</ref>) ''Gray Lensman'' (and its [http://www.ethanfleischer.com/lensman/gallery_gl.htm cover illustration]) was extremely well received. [[John W.

An extended segment in the novel version of ''Triplanetary'', set during World War II, suggests intimate familiarity with explosives and munitions manufacturing. Some biographers cite as fact that, just as Smith's protagonist in this segment lost his job over failure to approve substandard munitions, Smith did, as well. Smith began work for the J. W. Allen Company (a manufacturer of doughnut and frosting mixes) in 1946 and worked for them until his professional retirement in 1957.<ref name=\"dict\" />\n\n===Retirement and late writing===\n\nAfter Smith retired, his wife and he lived in [[Clearwater, Florida]],<ref name=\"wt640406\"/> in the fall and winter, driving the smaller of their two trailers to [[Seaside, Oregon]], each April, often stopping at [[science fiction convention]]s on the way. (Smith did not like to fly.<ref>Pohl in Lucchetti p. 15, Al Trestrail in Lucchetti p. 19. Al Trestrail (p. 20) and Pohl (p. 14) also mention church attendance (Pohl in a fictional context), which none of the other sources seem to.</ref>) In 1963, he was presented the inaugural [[First Fandom Hall of Fame award]] at the [[21st World Science Fiction Convention]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"wt640406\"/> Some of his biography is captured in an essay by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], which was reprinted in the collection ''Expanded Universe'' in 1980. A more detailed, although allegedly<ref>[[Gharlane of Eddore (Pen-name)|Gharlane of Eddore]], [http://www.chronology.org/noframes/lens/ Lensman FAQ], under \"References.\"</ref> error-ridden biography is in Sam Moskowitz's ''Seekers of Tomorrow.''\n\nRobert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' \"To Edward E. Smith, PhD\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Heinlein, Robert A | title=Methuselah's Children | publisher=Baen Publishing Enterprises | year=1986 | isbn=0-671-65597-3}}</ref>) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his \"unrealistic\" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]''. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of \"superman\" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by [[bone conduction]]\u2014a process apparently improvised on the spot.\n\nIn his nonseries novels written after his professional retirement, ''Galaxy Primes'', ''Subspace Explorers'', and ''Subspace Encounter'', E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called \"psionics\", and of the conflict between [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. ''Galaxy Primes'' was written after critics such as [[Groff Conklin]] and [[P. Schuyler Miller]] in the early '50s accused his fiction of being pass\u00e9, and he made an attempt to do something more in line with the concepts about which ''Astounding'' editor John W. Campbell encouraged his writers to make stories. Despite this, it was rejected by Campbell, and it was eventually published by ''Amazing Stories'' in 1959. His late story \"The Imperial Stars\" (1964), featuring a troupe of circus performers involved in sabotage in a galactic empire, recaptured some of the atmosphere from his earlier works and was intended as the first in a new series, with outlines of later parts rumored to still exist.<ref>[http://port70.net/cgi/httpgate.rss.cgi?9text/books/By%20Author/smith%2C%20edward%20elmer/Smith%2C%20E.%20E.%20Doc%20-%20Best%20of%20EE%20Doc%20Smith.pdf The Best of E.E. \"Doc\" Smith. Classic Adventures in Space By One of SF's Great Originals]</ref>\n\nThe fourth ''Skylark'' novel, ''[[Skylark DuQuesne]]'', ran in the June to October 1965 issues of ''If'', beginning once again as the cover story. Editor [[Frederik Pohl]] introduced it with a one-page summary of the previous stories, which were all at least 30 years old.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\n===Lord Tedric===\n\nSmith published two novelettes entitled \"Tedric\" in ''Other Worlds Science Fiction Stories'' (1953) and \"Lord Tedric\" in ''Universe Science Fiction'' (1954). These were almost completely forgotten until after Smith's death. In 1975, a compendium of Smith's works was published, entitled ''The Best of E. E. \"Doc\" Smith'', containing these two short stories, excerpts from several of his major works, and another short story first published in ''Worlds of If'' in 1964 entitled \"The Imperial Stars\".\n\nIn Smith's original short stories, Tedric was a smith (both blacksmith and whitesmith) residing in a small town near a castle in a situation roughly equivalent to [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England of the 1200s]]. He received instruction in advanced metallurgy from a [[time-travel]]er who wanted to change the situation in his own time by modifying certain events of the past. From this instruction, he was able to build better suits of armor and help defeat the villains of the piece. Unlike Eklund's later novels based on these short stories, the original Tedric never left his own time or planet, and fought purely local enemies of his own time period.\n\nA few years later and 13 years after Smith's death, Verna Smith arranged with [[Gordon Eklund]] to publish another novel of the same name about the same fictional character, introducing it as \"a new series conceived by E. E. 'Doc' Smith\". Eklund later went on to publish the other novels in the series, one or two under the pseudonym \"E. E. 'Doc' Smith\" or \"E. E. Smith\". The protagonist possesses heroic qualities similar to those of the heroes in Smith's original novels and can communicate with an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Scientists, whose archenemy is Fra Villion, a mysterious character described as a dark knight, skilled in whip-sword combat, and evil genius behind the creation of a planetoid-sized \"iron sphere\" armed with a weapon capable of destroying planets. As a result, Smith is believed by many to be the unacknowledged progenitor of themes that would appear in ''[[Star Wars]]''. In fact, however, these appear in the sequels written by others after Smith's death.\n\n==Critical opinion==\n\nSmith's novels are generally considered to be classic [[space opera]]s,<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Sir Arthur C.]]|title=[[Astounding Days]]|pages= 102\u20133 ff}}</ref> and he is sometimes called the first of the three \"[[nova]]s\" of 20th-century science fiction (with [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]] as the second and third novas).<ref>Clarke, ''op. cit.'' p. 120, citing and agreeing with Isaac Asimov in his introduction to ''The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum'', who was the second nova.</ref>\n\nHeinlein credited him for being his main influence: \"I have learned from many writers\u2014from [[Jules Verne|Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells|Wells]] and [[John W. Campbell|Campbell]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]], et al.\u2014but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together ...\"<ref>William H. Patterson. ''Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century''. New York: Tor Books, 2014, p. 200</ref>\n\nSmith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: \"the more highly improbable a concept is\u2014short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals\u2014the better I like it\" was his phrase.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, E.E.|title=[[Of Worlds Beyond]]|page= 84|edition= Advent }}</ref>\n\n<!-- 2013-03-26 these two new paragraphs don't fit section heading \"Critical opinion\" but neither does the old content -->''Lensman'' was one of five finalists when the 1966 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] judged the [[Foundation series|Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation'']] the Best All-Time Series.<ref name=SFAwards>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit125.html#4842|author=Smith, Edward E.|title=The Locus Index of SF Awards: Index of Literary Nominees|website=[[Locus Publications]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016201144/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit125.html#4842|archivedate=October 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted Smith in 2004.<ref name=sfhof-old>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ \n |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame \n |website=Mid American Science Fiction and Fantasy Conventions, Inc. \n |accessdate=March 26, 2013 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521070009/http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ \n |archivedate=May 21, 2013 \n |df=mdy \n}} This was the official website of the hall of fame to 2004.</ref>\n\n==Extending the ''Lensman'' universe==\n\n''Vortex Blasters'' (also known as ''Masters of the Vortex'') is set in the same universe as the ''Lensman'' novels. It is an extension to the main storyline which takes place between ''Galactic Patrol'' and ''Children of the Lens'', and introduces a different type of psionics from that used by the Lensmen. ''Spacehounds of IPC'' is not a part of the series, despite occasional erroneous statements to the contrary. (It is listed as a novel in the series in some paperback editions of the 1970s.)\n\nRobert A. Heinlein reported that Smith had planned a seventh ''Lensman'' novel, set after the events described in ''Children of the Lens'', which was unpublishable at that time (the early 1960s).<ref>Robert A. Heinlein, \"Larger Than Life\", reprinted in ''[[Expanded Universe]]'', Ace Books, 1980.</ref> Smith told Heinlein that the new novel proceeded inexorably from matters left unresolved in ''Children'', a statement easily supported by a careful reading of ''Children''. Careful searches by people who knew Smith well (including Frederik Pohl, Smith's editor, and Verna Smith Trestrail, Smith's daughter) have failed to locate any material related to such a story.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Smith apparently never wrote any of it down.\n\nOn July 14, 1965, barely a month before his death, Smith gave written permission to [[William B. Ellern]] to continue the ''Lensman'' series, which led to the publishing of \"Moon Prospector\" in 1965 and ''New Lensman'' in 1976. Smith's long-time friend, [[Dave Kyle]], wrote three authorized added novels in the ''Lensman'' series that provided background about the major nonhuman Lensmen: ''Dragon Lensman'', ''Lensman from Rigel'', and ''Z-Lensman''.\n\n==Influence on science and the military==\n\nSmith was widely read by scientists and engineers from the 1930s into the 1970s. Literary precursors of ideas which arguably entered the military-scientific complex include [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]] (''Triplanetary''), [[Stealth technology|stealth]] (''Gray Lensman''), the [[OODA loop]], [[Command and control|C3]]-based warfare, and the [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] (''Gray Lensman'').\n\nAn inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell to E. E. Smith, pages 1\u20132, Dated June 11, 1947.</ref> to Doc from John W. Campbell (the editor of ''Astounding'', where much of the ''Lensman'' series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain [[Cal Laning]]'s<ref>Presumably, this is later Rear Admiral Caleb Lanning, shipmate, friend, and occasional co-author of Heinlein.</ref> acknowledgment that he had used Smith's ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the \"tank\" in the stories) in the design of the [[United States Navy]]'s ships' [[Operations room|Combat Information Centers]]. \"The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the ''Directrix''. In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in\u2014more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy\u2014not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet\u2014learned at an appalling cost.\"\n\nOne underlying theme of the later ''Lensman'' novels was the difficulty in maintaining military secrecy\u2014as advanced capabilities are revealed, the opposing side can often duplicate them. This point was also discussed extensively by John Campbell in his letter to Doc.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell to E. E. Smith, page 2-3, Dated June 11, 1947.</ref> Also in the later ''Lensman'' novels, and particular after the \"Battle of Klovia\" broke the Boskonian's power base at the end of ''Second Stage Lensmen'', the Boskonian forces and particularly Kandron of Onlo reverted to terroristic tactics to attempt to demoralize Civilization, thus providing an early literary glimpse into this modern problem of both law enforcement and military response. The use of \"Vee-two\" gas by the pirates attacking the ''Hyperion'' in ''Triplanetary'' (in both magazine and book appearances) also suggests anticipation of the terrorist uses of poison gases. (But note that Smith lived through WW I, when the use of poison gas on troops was well known to the populace; extending the assumption that pirates might use it if they could obtain it was no great extension of the present-day knowledge.)\n\nThe beginning of the story ''Skylark of Space'' describes in relative detail the protagonist's research into separation of platinum group residues, subsequent experiments involving electrolysis, and the discovery of a process evocative of [[cold fusion]] (over 50 years before [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]]). He describes a nuclear process yielding large amounts of energy and producing only negligible radioactive waste\u2014which then goes on to form the basis of the adventures in the Skylark books. Smith's general description of the process of discovery is highly evocative of R\u00f6ntgen's descriptions of his discovery of the [[X-ray]].\n\nAnother theme of the ''Skylark'' novels involves precursors of modern information technology. The humanoid aliens encountered in the first novel have developed a primitive technology called the \"mechanical educator\", which allows direct conversion of brain waves into intelligible thought for transmission to others or for electrical storage. By the third novel in the series, ''Skylark of Valeron'', this technology has grown into an \"Electronic Brain\" which is capable of computation on all \"bands\" of energy\u2014electromagnetism, gravity, and \"tachyonic\" energy and radiation bands included. This is itself derived from a discussion of reductionist atomic theory in the second novel, ''Skylark Three'', which brings to mind modern quark and sub-quark theories of elementary particle physics.\n\n==Literary influences==\n\nIn his 1947 essay \"The Epic of Space\", Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, [[L. Sprague de Camp]], Robert A. Heinlein, [[Murray Leinster]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[A. Merritt]] (specifically ''[[The Ship of Ishtar]]'', ''[[The Moon Pool]]'', ''[[The Snake Mother]]'', and ''[[Dwellers in the Mirage]]'', as well as the character John Kenton), [[C. L. Moore]] (specifically \"[[Jirel of Joiry]]\"), [[Roman Frederick Starzl]], [[Eric Temple Bell|John Taine]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] (specifically [[Tweel (A Martian Odyssey)|\"Tweerl\"]]<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 80. The conventional spelling is \"Tweel\", though the most accurate spelling is \"Trrrweerrlll.\" (\"[[A Martian Odyssey]]\", ''The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum'' p. 5.)</ref>), and [[Jack Williamson]]. In a passage on his preparation for writing the ''Lensman'' novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu's \"War of the Universe\" was not a masterpiece,<ref>Both Constantinescu's name and title are misspelled in the essay: Canstantinescu's \"War of the Universes\", p. 84.</ref><ref>Clinton Constantinescu (1912\u20131999), later Clinton Constant, was a [[Romanian Canadian]] chemical engineer and a member of the American Astronomical Society and several other scientific associations [http://d7beta.aas.org/obituaries/clinton-constant-1912-1999]. \"War of the Universe\", one of his forays into science fiction, depicted a grand multisided space melee using a great variety of superscience weapons, and involving various human races which developed independently of each other on many planets, as well as insectoid, bird-like, and termite-like creatures. A summary is provided on p. 83 of Everett Franklin Bleiler and Richard Bleiler's ''\"Science-fiction: The Gernsback Years\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PbMdeizaCNcC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=%22Clinton+Constant%22&source=bl&ots=ODzjoiJKPC&sig=tmzDxFeXNJN0WNUKp7Z5XYFERWc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=05wPUdjbEJHHsgbwmoGIDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22Clinton%20Constant%22&f=false]</ref> but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl's Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith's Triplanetary Patrol, later the ''Galactic Patrol''. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the [[Energy (esotericism)|life-force]] of their victims at the end of chapter five of ''Galactic Patrol'' seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of ''The Moon Pool'', Merritt's account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of ''Children of the Lens.''<ref>''The Moon Pool,''  A. Merritt, chapters 29 and 34</ref> Smith also mentions [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.\n\nSmith acknowledges the help of the Galactic Roamers writers' workshop, plus [[E. Everett Evans]], Ed Counts, an unnamed aeronautical engineer, Dr. James Enright, and Dr. Richard W. Dodson. Smith's daughter, Verna, lists the following authors as visitors to the Smith household in her youth: [[Lloyd Arthur Eshbach]], Heinlein, [[Dave Kyle]], [[Wilson Tucker|Bob Tucker]], Williamson, Pohl, Merritt, and the Galactic Roamers. Smith cites Bigelow's ''Theoretical Chemistry\u2013Fundamentals'' as a justification for the possibility of the [[inertialess drive]]. Also, an extended reference is made to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s \"[http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_bohdathone_notes.htm Ballad of Boh Da Thone]\" in ''Gray Lensman'' (chapter 22, \"Regeneration\", in a conversation between Kinnison and MacDougall).\n\n[[Sam Moskowitz]]'s biographical essay on Smith in ''Seekers of Tomorrow'' states that he regularly read ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' magazine, and everything by [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith's \"reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature\".<ref>Moskowitz p. 14.</ref> (Smith's grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.<ref>Al Trestrail, in Lucchetti, p. 20.</ref>) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of ''Triplanetary'', and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith's narration. Some influence of 19th-century [[philosophy of language]] may be detectable in the account in ''Galactic Patrol'' of the Lens of [[Arisia]] as a [[universal translator]], which is reminiscent of [[Frege]]'s strong [[Philosophical realism|realism]] about ''Sinn'', that is, thought or sense.\n\nBoth Moskowitz and Smith's daughter Verna Smith Trestrail report that Smith had a troubled relationship with John Campbell, the editor of ''Astounding''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Smith's most successful works were published under Campbell, but the degree of influence is uncertain. The original outline for the ''Lensman'' series had been accepted by [[F. Orlin Tremaine]],<ref name=\"mosk19\">Moskowitz p. 19</ref> and Smith angered Campbell by showing loyalty to Tremaine at his new magazine, ''Comet'', when he sold him \"The Vortex Blaster\" in 1941.<ref>Moskowitz p. 21</ref> Campbell's announcement of ''Children of the Lens'', in 1947, was less than enthusiastic.<ref>Moskowitz p. 23.</ref> Campbell later said that he published it only reluctantly,<ref>Sanders p. 15.</ref> though he praised it privately,<ref>Letter to [[Clifford Simak]] June 18, 1953, ''The John W. Campbell Letters'' Volume 1, p. 177.</ref> and bought little from Smith thereafter.\n\n==Derivative works and influence on popular culture==\n\n* [[Randall Garrett]] wrote a parody entitled ''[[Backstage Lensman]]'' which Smith reportedly enjoyed. [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] also parodied Smith's work in the novel, ''[[Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers]]''.\n*Garrett also included a reference to Smith in his ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' novels; the badge of the Royal Messengers resembles the Lens, and the spell to activate one was devised by a wizard named Dr Edward Elmer.\n* Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s space battle in ''[[Earthlight]]'' was based on the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of ''[[Skylark Three]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Arthur C. | authorlink = Arthur C.

Efforts to print translations of the associated [[manga]] in the United States in the early 1990s without payment of royalties to the Smith family were successfully blocked in court by Verna Smith Trestrail with the help of several California science-fiction authors and fans.\n* In his biography, [[George Lucas]] reveals that the ''Lensman'' novels were a major influence on his youth. [[J. Michael Straczynski]], creator of the science-fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', also has acknowledged the influence of the ''Lensman'' books.<ref>[http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035904p1.html IGN: Interview with J.

[[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had succeeded [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] in 1824, but in 1827 [[Ultra-royalist|his party]] suffered a [[French legislative election, 1827|major electoral setback]] and by 1830 the [[Doctrinaires|opposition liberal party]] [[French legislative election, 1830|became the majority]]. Charles, faced with abdication, staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, and issued his notorious [[July Ordinances]], touching off the [[July Revolution]]<ref name=\":2\" /> which ended with [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] becoming king. While their counterparts at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique|Polytechnique]] were making history in the streets during ''[[July Revolution|les Trois Glorieuses]]'', Galois and all the other students at the [[\u00c9cole Normale]] were locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the ''Gazette des \u00c9coles'', signing the letter with his full name.

At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois' former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.\n\nIn April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]]. The proceedings grew riotous, and Galois proposed a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] with a [[dagger]] above his cup, which was interpreted as a threat against the king's life.

This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fianc\u00e9, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself famously exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\"<ref name=\"dupuy\" />\n\nMuch more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois' biographers (most notably by [[Eric Temple Bell]] in ''[[Men of Mathematics]]''), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy.<ref name=\"bell\" />\n\nAs to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville,<ref name=\"dumas\"/> who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois' first arrest.<ref name=\"blanc\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Blanc\n  | first = Louis\n  | title = The History of Ten Years, 1830-1840, Volume 1\n  | publisher = Chapman and Hall\n  | location = London\n  | year = 1844\n  | page = 431\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hH52mPMmlzcC&pg=PA431#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}\n</ref> However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved.

On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L.D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois' Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges.<ref name=\"dalmas\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Dalmas\n  | first = Andre\n  | title = \u00c9variste Galois: R\u00e9volutionnaire et G\u00e9om\u00e8tre\n  | publisher = Fasquelle\n  | location = Paris\n  | year = 1956 }}\n</ref> Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.\n\nWhatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts.<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\">{{cite journal\n | last = Galois\n | first = \u00c9variste\n | year = 1846\n | title = Lettre de Galois \u00e0 M.

He developed the concept that is today known as a [[normal subgroup]]. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right [[coset]]s a ''proper decomposition'' if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup.<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\" /> He also introduced the concept of a [[finite field]] (also known as a [[Galois field]] in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.<ref name=\"numtheory\" />\n\nIn his last letter to Chevalier<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\" /> and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:\n*He constructed the [[General linear group#Over finite fields|general linear group over a prime field]], GL(''\u03bd'', ''p'') and computed its order, in studying the Galois group of the general equation of degree ''p<sup>\u03bd</sup>''.<ref>Letter, p. 410</ref>\n*He constructed the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,''p'').

He realized that the algebraic solution to a [[polynomial]] equation is related to the structure of a group of [[permutation]]s associated with the roots of the polynomial, the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in [[nth root|radicals]] if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with [[abelian group|abelian]] quotient, or its Galois group is [[solvable group|solvable]]. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the [[theory of equations]] to which Galois originally applied it.<ref name=\"lie\" />\n\n=== Analysis ===\nGalois also made some contributions to the theory of [[Abelian integral]]s and [[continued fraction]]s.\n\nAs written in his last letter,<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\" /> Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories.\n\n=== Continued fractions ===\nIn his first paper in 1828,<ref name=\"continuedfraction\" /> Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd ''\u03b6'' is purely periodic if and only if ''\u03b6'' is a [[Periodic continued fraction#Reduced surds|reduced surd]], that is, <math>\\zeta > 1</math> and its [[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]] <math>\\eta</math>\nsatisfies <math>-1 < \\eta < 0</math>.\n\nIn fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if ''\u03b6'' is a reduced quadratic surd and ''\u03b7'' is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for ''\u03b6'' and for (&minus;1/''\u03b7'') are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\zeta& = [\\,\\overline{a_0;a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_{m-1}}\\,]\\\\[3pt]\n\\frac{-1}{\\eta}& = [\\,\\overline{a_{m-1};a_{m-2},a_{m-3},\\dots,a_0}\\,]\\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is any reduced quadratic surd, and ''\u03b7'' is its conjugate.\n\nFrom these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then\n\n:<math>\n\\sqrt{r} = \\left[\\,a_0;\\overline{a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_2,a_1,2a_0}\\,\\right].\n</math>\n\nIn particular, if ''n'' is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of &radic;''n'' contains a repeating block of length ''m'', in which the first ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 partial denominators form a [[palindrome|palindromic]] string.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Group theory]]\n* [[List of things named after \u00c9variste Galois]]\n* [[Niels Henrik Abel]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation|last=Artin|first=Emil|author-link=Emil Artin|title=Galois Theory|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=0-486-62342-4|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndml/1175197041}} \u2013 Reprinting of second revised edition of 1944, The University of Notre Dame Press.\n*{{Citation|last=Astruc|first=Alexandre|author-link=Alexandre Astruc|year=1994|title=\u00c9variste Galois|publisher=Flammarion|language=French|series=Grandes Biographies|isbn=2-08-066675-4}}\n*{{Citation|last=Bell|first=E.T.|author-link=Eric Temple Bell|year=1937|title=[[Men of Mathematics]]|volume=2|chapter=Galois}}.

c. 239 \u2013 c. 169 BC) was a writer and poet who lived during the [[Roman Republic]]. He is often considered the father of Roman [[poetry]]. He was born in [[Rudiae]],<ref>[[#Smith|Smith  (1852)]], p. 359. \"Rudiae is celebrated as the birthplace of Ennius.\"</ref> formerly a small town located near modern [[Lecce]] in the heel of Italy (ancient [[Calabria#Etymology|Calabria]], today [[Salento]]), and could speak [[Oscan language|Oscan]] as well as Latin and Greek. Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in [[Latin literature]] was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models.\n\n==Biography==\nVery little is reliably known about the life of Ennius. His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings.<ref>E. Badian, \u201cEnnius and his Friends\u201d in ''Ennius'', Fondation Hardt, Geneva 1972, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Se1MLtw658C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false pp.149-99]</ref> Some lines of the ''Annales'', as well as ancient testimonies, for example, suggest that Ennius opened his epic with a recollection of a dream in which the ancient epic-writer [[Homer]] informed him that his spirit had been reborn into Ennius.<ref>[[#Aicher|Aicher (1989)]], pp. 227{{en dash}}32.</ref> It is true that the doctrine of the [[Metempsychosis#In Greek philosophy|transmigration of souls]] once flourished in the areas of Italy settled by Greeks, but the statement might have been no more than a literary flourish. Ennius seems to have been given to making large claims, as in the report by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] that he claimed descent from Messapus, the legendary king of his native district.<ref>Commentary on the ''Aeneid'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D7%3Acommline%3D691 vii. 691]</ref> The partly Hellenised city of [[Rudiae]], his place of  birth, was certainly in the area settled by the [[Messapians]]. And this, he used to say, according to [[Aulus Gellius]], had endowed him with a triple linguistic and cultural heritage, fancifully described as \"three hearts\u2026 Greek, Oscan and Latin\u201d.<ref>''Noctes Atticae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0072:id=v3.p.263 17.17.1]</ref>\n\nThe public career of Ennius first really emerges in middle life, when he was serving in the army with the rank of [[centurion]] during the [[Second Punic War]].  While in [[Sardinia]] in the year 204 BC, he is said to have attracted the attention of [[Cato the Elder]] and was taken by him to Rome. There he taught Greek and adapted Greek plays for a livelihood, and by his poetical compositions gained the friendship of some of the greatest men in Rome whose achievements he praised. Amongst these were [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Fulvius Nobilior]], whom he accompanied on his Aetolian campaign (189). Afterwards he made the capture of [[Ambracia]], at which he was present, the subject of a play and of an episode in the ''Annales''. It was through the influence of Nobilior's son [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior|Quintus]] that Ennius subsequently obtained Roman citizenship. But he himself lived plainly and simply in the literary quarter on the [[Aventine Hill]] with the poet [[Caecilius Statius]], a fellow adapter of Greek plays. \n\nAt about the age of 70 Ennius died, immediately after producing his tragedy ''Thyestes''. In the last book of his epic poem, in which he seems to have given various details of his personal history, he mentioned that he was in his 67th year at the date of its composition. He compared himself, in contemplation of the close of the great work of his life, to a gallant horse which, after having often won the prize at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], obtained his rest when weary with age. A similar feeling of pride at the completion of a great career is expressed in the memorial lines which he composed to be placed under his bust after death: \u201cLet no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.\u201d<ref>Most of this section is drawn from the 1911 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\nEnnius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing plays in Greek and Roman style ([[praetexta]]e and [[Fabula palliata|palliatae]]), as well as his most famous work, a historic epic in hexameters called the ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]''. Other minor works include the  ''Epicharmus'', ''Epigrammata'', the ''Euhemerus'', the ''Hedyphagetica'', ''Praecepta''/''Protrepticus'', ''Saturae'' (or ''Satires''), ''Scipio'', and ''Sota''.<ref name=oxford>[[#La Barbera|La Barbera (2014)]].</ref>\n\n===The ''Annales''===\n\nThe ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'' was an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of [[Troy]] in 1184 BC down to the censorship of [[Cato the Elder]] in 184 BC.  It was the first Latin poem to adopt the [[dactylic hexameter]] metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry,<ref>{{cite web|title=FJCL Latin Literature Study Guide|url=http://www.fjcl.org/uploads/4/3/4/0/4340783/latin_lit_study_guide.pdf|publisher=Florida Junior Classical League|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref> leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry.  The ''Annals'' became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. About 600 lines survive. A copy of the work is among the Latin rolls of the [[Herculaneum]] library.\n\n===Minor works===\n\nThe ''Epicharmus'' was inspired by the philosophical hypotheses developed by the Sicilian poet and philosopher [[Epicharmus of Kos]], after which Ennius's work took its name.<ref name=ebcite>[[#EB|Editors of ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (2016)]].</ref><ref>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 220{{en dash}}21.</ref> In the ''Epicharmus'', the poet describes a dream he had in which he died and was transported to some place of heavenly enlightenment. Here, he met Epicharmus, who explained the nature of the gods and taught Ennius the physics of the [[universe]].<ref>[[#Merry|Merry (1891)]], p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe ''Euhemerus'' presented a [[theology|theological]] doctrine based on the ideas Greek of [[Euhemerus|Euhemerus of Messene]], who argued that the gods of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]] were not supernatural powers that interference in the lives of humans, but rather heroes of old who [[Apotheosis|after death were eventually regarded as deities]] due to their valor, bravery, or cultural impact (this belief is now known as [[euhemerism]]). Both [[Cicero]] and [[Lactantius]] write that the ''Euhemerus'' was a \"translat[ion] and a recount[ing]\" of Euhemerus's original work the ''Sacred History'', but it is unclear if this means Ennius simply translated the original from Greek into Latin, or added in his own elements. Most of what is preserved of this work comes to us from Lactantius, and these snippets suggest that the ''Euhemerus'' was a prose text.<ref>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 238{{en dash}}40.</ref>\n\nThe ''Hedyphagetica'' took much of its substance from the [[gastronomy|gastronomical]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] of [[Archestratus|Archestratus of Gela]]. The extant portions of Ennius's poem discuss where a reader might find the best type of fish. Most of the fragments, replete with unique terms for fish and numerous place names, are corrupt or damaged. The ''Hedyphagetica'' is written in  [[hexameter]]s, but differs from the ''Annales'' in regards to \"metrical practices\"; this difference is largely due to each works' distinct subject matter.<ref>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 260{{en dash}}61.</ref>\n\nThe titles ''Praecepta'' and ''Protrepticus'' were likely used to refer to the same (possibly exhortatory) work. However, given this work's almost non-existent nature (only the word ''pannibus''{{em dash}}an \"unusual\" form of the word ''pannis'', meaning \"rags\"{{em dash}}is preserved in the work of the [[Latin]] [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Charisius]]), this position is extremely difficult to verify.<ref name=oxford/><ref>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 268{{en dash}}69.</ref>\n\nThe ''Saturae'' is a collection of about thirty lines from satirical poems{{em dash}}making it the first extant instance of Roman satire.<ref name=oxford/> These lines are written in a variety of poetic metres.<ref name=oxford/><ref>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 270{{en dash}}71.</ref> The poems in this collection \"were mostly concerned with practical wisdom, often driving home a lesson with the help of a fable.\"<ref name=ebcite/>\n\nEnnius's ''Scipio'' was a work (possibly a [[panegyric]] poem) that apparently celebrated the life and deeds of [[Scipio Africanus]]. Hardly anything remains of this work, and what is preserved is embedded in the works of others. Unfortunately, \"no quotation of [''Scipio''] supplies a context\".<ref name=scipioegm/> Some have proposed that the work was written before the ''Annales'', and others have said that the work was written after Scipio's 201 BC triumph that followed the [[Battle of Zama]] (202 BC).<ref name=scipioegm>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 286{{en dash}}87.</ref>\n\nThe ''Sota'' was a poem, potentially of some length, named after the Greek poet [[Sotades]]. The work, which followed a metre established by Sotades known as the \"Sotadeus\", concerned itself with a disparate number of topics and ideas.<ref>[[#Goldberg|Ennius, Goldberg, & Manuwald (2018)]], pp. 296{{en dash}}97.</ref>\n\n==Editions==\n* Quinto Ennio.

Eris' Greek opposite is [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], whose Latin counterpart is [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]]. [[Homer]] equated her with the war-goddess [[Enyo]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] is named after the goddess.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Eris'' is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''orinein'', \"to raise, stir, excite,\" and the proper name \u1f18\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2 ''[[Erinyes]]'' have been suggested. [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects these derivations and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 459).</ref>\n\n==Characteristics in Greek mythology==\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|right|''[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|El Juicio de Paris]]'' by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904]]\n[[File:Golden Apple of Discord by Jacob Jordaens.jpg|thumb|''Golden [[apple of discord]]'' by [[Jakob Jordaens]], 1633]]\n[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|''Das Urteil des Paris'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], c. 1757]]\n\nIn [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' 11\u201324, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:\n\n<blockquote><poem>So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\n\nBut the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and [[Zeus|the son of Cronus who sits above]] and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\n\n:And hateful Eris bore painful [[Ponos]] (\"Hardship\"),\n:[[Lethe]] (\"Forgetfulness\") and [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] (\"Starvation\") and the tearful [[Algos|Algea]] (\"Pains\"),\n:[[Hysminai]] (\"Battles\"), [[Makhai]] (\"Wars\"), [[Phonoi]] (\"Murders\"), and [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] (\"Manslaughters\");\n: [[Neikea]] (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudo-Logoi (\"Lying Stories\"), [[Amphillogiai]] (\"Disputes\")\n:[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] (\"Anarchy\") and [[At\u00eb|Ate]] (\"Ruin\"), near one another,\n:and [[Horkos]] (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,\n:Then willing swears a false oath.<ref>Translation by Richard Caldwell, ''Hesiod's Theogony'', Focus Publishing/R. Pullins Company (June 1, 1987). {{ISBN|978-0-941051-00-2}}.</ref>\n\n\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:\n\n<blockquote>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].</blockquote>\n\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.\n\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\n\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed {{lang-grc|[[Kallisti|\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3]]|translit=t\u0113(i) kallist\u0113(i)}} &nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"&nbsp;\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris' decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]]. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\n\nIn [[Nonnus]]' ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:\n\n<blockquote>Eris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.</blockquote>\n\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to rack discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos' son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\n\n==Cultural influences==\n===Discordianism===\n{{Main|Discordianism}}\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of \"[[Malaclypse the Younger]]\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.\n\nA quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:\n\n{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. \"They were,\" She added, \"victims of indigestion, you know.\"\n\nSuffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#The \"original snub\"|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php|title=Principia Discordia - Page 49|website=www.principiadiscordia.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:\n\n{{Quote|text=I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos.

Her middle name derives from [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in [[New York City|New York]], where her uncle's life had been saved just before her birth.

Cora and her three daughters, Edna (who called herself \"Vincent\"), Norma Lounella (born 1893), and Kathleen Kalloch (born 1896), moved from town to town, living in poverty. Cora travelled with a trunk full of classic literature, including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton|Milton]], which she read to her children. The family settled in a small house on the property of Cora's aunt in [[Camden, Maine]], where Millay would write the first of the poems that would bring her literary fame.\n\nThe three sisters were independent and spoke their minds, which did not always sit well with the authority figures in their lives.

In the 1906 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3E8TAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=folkways&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQpcjo1YHeAhWP14MKHT36AqAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=folkways&f=false ''Folkways''], Sumner stated that \"ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it\" (13). In the 1911 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc81TuuKB54C&printsec=frontcover&dq=war+and+other+essays&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjR5r2J1oHeAhVK9YMKHTjrBosQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=war%20and%20other%20essays&f=false ''War and Other Essays''], he wrote that \"the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism\" (11).\n\nForty years later, anthropologist Richard Adams undertook to clear up a confusion.  He noted that one scholar, G.P. Murdock, defined ethnocentrism as \"the tendency to exalt the in-group and to depreciate other groups,\" which made out-group antagonism the inevitable concomitant of in-group solidarity, but that another, M. J. Herkovits, defined ethnocentrism as \"the point of view that one's way of life s to be preferred to all others.\" He pointed out that these were two different attitudes, and that it was important to distinguish them. The first is in-group consciousness, a sense of communal interests found even in sub-human animals, but the second arises from the processes of socialization and enculturation, and has no counterpart among sub-human groups.<ref>[https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.bu.edu/stable/664284?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=ti%3Aethnocentrism&searchText=OR&searchText=tb%3Aethnocentrism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Ff2%3Dall%26amp%3Bf0%3Dti%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bq2%3D%26amp%3Bf1%3Dall%26amp%3Bf5%3Dall%26amp%3Bsd%3D1951%26amp%3Bq6%3D%26amp%3Bc2%3DAND%26amp%3Bq4%3D%26amp%3Bed%3D1951%26amp%3Bc3%3DAND%26amp%3Bq0%3Dethnocentrism%26amp%3Bc6%3DAND%26amp%3Bq3%3D%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bq1%3D%26amp%3Bisbn%3D%26amp%3Bq5%3D%26amp%3Bf4%3Dall%26amp%3Bc4%3DAND%26amp%3Bpt%3D%26amp%3Bc1%3DAND%26amp%3Bla%3D%26amp%3Bc5%3DAND%26amp%3Bf3%3Dall%26amp%3Bf6%3Dall&refreqid=search%3Aa4a0f09f57bfc60d9c84d8cfe49d6994&seq=1/action/showAdvancedSearch Richard N.

Franz Boas committed himself to overthrowing 19th-century evolutionism, and with his methodological innovations sought to show the error of the proposition that race determined cultural capacity. <ref>[https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/bualumni-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3440450&ppg=446 Thomas Hylland Eriksen, ''Small Places, Large Issues:  An Introduction to Social and Cultural Anthropology'', 4th edition, London: Pluto Press, 2015, pp.10-18]</ref>  Boas wrote:\n\n:It is somewhat difficult for us to recognize that the value which we attribute to our own civilization is due to the fact that we participate in this civilization, and that it has been controlling all our actions from the time of our birth; but it is certainly conceivable that there may be other civilizations, based perhaps on different traditions and on a different equilibrium of emotion and reason, which are of no less value than ours, although it may be impossible for us to appreciate their values without having grown up under their influence.<ref>''The Mind of Primitive Man'', New York: Macmillan. 1911:207</ref> \n\nBoas and his colleagues promulgated the principle that there are no inferior races or cultures.

Classic examples of anti-ethnocentric anthropology include [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' (1928), Malinowski's ''[[The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia]]'' (1929), and [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[Ruth Benedict#Patterns of Culture|Patterns of Culture]]'' (1934). (Mead and Benedict were two of Boas's students.)\n\nExamples of ethnocentrism include [[religiocentric]] constructs claiming a [[divine]] association like \"divine nation\", \"[[God's Own Country]]\", \"[[God's Chosen People]]\", and \"God's Promised Land\".<ref name=\"HavilandPrins20093\"/> Although this may be seen as classic examples, a study published by Brill showed that religious attitudes do not effect on negative out-group attitudes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religion and Ethnocentrism: An Empirical-theological Study|last=Capucao|first=Dave|publisher=Brill|year=2010|isbn=9789004184701|location=|pages=247}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Precarious Life'', [[Judith Butler]] discusses recognizing the Other in order to sustain the Self and the problems of not being able to identify the Other. Butler writes:\n\n:Identification always relies upon a difference that it seeks to overcome, and that its aim is accomplished only by reintroducing the difference it claims to have vanquished. The one with whom I identify is not me, and that \"not being me\" is the condition of the identification. Otherwise, as Jacqueline Rose reminds us, identification collapses into identity, which spells the death of identification itself.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXj3rCh9zRwC|title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=2004|publisher=Verso|isbn=9781844675449|location=New York|pages=145\u2013146|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nScholars are generally agreed that Boas developed his revolutionary ideas under the influence of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant.  Legend has it that, on a field trip to the Baffin Islands in 1883, Boas would pass the frigid nights reading Kant\u2019s monumental ''Critique of Pure Reason''.  In that work, Kant argued that human understanding could not be described according to the laws that applied to the operations of nature, and that its operations were therefore free, not determined, and that ideas regulated human action, sometimes independent of material interests.  Following Kant, Boas pointed out, for instance, the starving Eskimos who, because of their religious beliefs,would not hunt seals to feed themselves, thus showing that no pragmatic or material calculus determined their values (''The Mind of Primitive Man'', New York: Macmillan, 1911:126). <ref>[https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.bu.edu/stable/29790560?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=au%3A&searchText=%22janine+hitchens%22&searchText=AND&searchText=%28ti%3Aboas&searchText=OR&searchText=tb%3Aboas%29&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Fc3%3DAND%26amp%3Bc4%3DAND%26amp%3Bq3%3D%26amp%3Bpt%3D%26amp%3Bf3%3Dall%26amp%3Bf2%3Dall%26amp%3Bf0%3Dau%26amp%3Bc1%3DAND%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bed%3D1994%26amp%3Bq4%3D%26amp%3Bq5%3D%26amp%3Bf4%3Dall%26amp%3Bf6%3Dall%26amp%3Bc5%3DAND%26amp%3Bf1%3Dti%26amp%3Bc2%3DAND%26amp%3Bf5%3Dall%26amp%3Bla%3D%26amp%3Bc6%3DAND%26amp%3Bisbn%3D%26amp%3Bq6%3D%26amp%3Bsd%3D1994%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bq2%3D%26amp%3Bq1%3Dboas%26amp%3Bq0%3Djanine%2Bhitchens&refreqid=search%3A7637dae387e89a6007d5575b363c2489&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents Janine Hitchens, \u201cCritical Implications of Franz Boas\u2019 Theory and Methodology,\u201d ''Dialectical Anthropology'', 19 (1994), p. 244].</ref>\n\n=== Consumer ethnocentrism ===\n[[Consumer ethnocentrism]] refers to the preference of buying products from one's own country with the purpose of protecting the economy and the jobs of people in the country.

It's theorized that in order to maintain that positive view, people make [[Social comparison theory|social comparisons]] that cast competing cultural groups in an unfavorable light.<ref>Tajfel, H., & Turner, J.

First, in the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the convention, drawing on the inspiration of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] can be seen as part of a wider response of the Allied Powers in delivering a human rights agenda through which it was believed that the most serious human rights violations which had occurred during the Second World War could be avoided in the future. Second, the Convention was a response to the growth of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and designed to protect the member states of the [[Council of Europe]] from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are \"necessary in a democratic society\" throughout the Convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ovey|first=Clare|title=The European Convention on Human Rights|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928810-6|pages=1\u20133|author2=Robin C.A.

The second and third Articles of Pledge stated: We desire  a Charter of Human Rights guaranteeing liberty of thought, assembly and expression as well as right to form a political opposition. We desire a Court of Justice with adequate sanctions for the implementation of this Charter.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cases and Materials on the European Convention on Human Rights.|last=Mowbray|first=Alastair|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-920674-2|location=Oxford, UK|pages=1-2}}</ref>\n\nThe Convention was drafted by the [[Council of Europe]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]] in response to a call issued by Europeans from all walks of life who had gathered at the [[Hague Congress (1948)|Hague Congress]]. Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft a \"charter of human rights\" and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]], the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention. As a prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], he had seen first-hand how international justice could be effectively applied. With his help, the French former minister and Resistance fighter [[Pierre-Henri Teitgen]] submitted a report<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Conferences/2009Anniversaire49/DocRef/Teitgen6.pdf Report by Pierre-Henri Teitgen of France, submitted to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe]</ref> to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] just agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate. After extensive debates,<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Conferences/2009Anniversaire49/DocRef/Teitgen7E.pdf Verbatim of the speech given by Pierre-Henri Teitgen when he presented his report to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe]</ref> the Assembly sent its final proposal<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Conferences/2009Anniversaire49/DocRef/Rec38_9.pdf Recommendation 38 of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on 'Human rights and fundamental freedoms']</ref> to the Council's Committee of Ministers, which convened a group of experts to draft the Convention itself.\n\nThe Convention was designed to incorporate a traditional [[civil liberties]] approach to securing \"effective political democracy\", from the strongest traditions in the United Kingdom, France and other member states of the fledgling [[Council of Europe]], as said by [[Guido Raimondi]], President of [[European Court of Human Rights]]:\n\n{{quote|The European system of protection of human rights with its Court would be inconceivable untied from democracy. In fact we have a bond that is not only regional or geographic: a State cannot be party to the European Convention on Human Rights if it is not a member of the Council of Europe; it cannot be a member State of the Council of Europe if it does not respect pluralist democracy, the rule of law and human rights. So a non-democratic State could not participate in the ECHR system: the protection of democracy goes hand in hand with the protection of rights.|Guido Raimondi<ref>{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/22369691/Allocuzione_del_presidente_Raimondi_alla_presentazione_dello_Scudo_in_Ara_Coeli {{lang|it|Immunit\u00e0 parlamentari e diritti umani}}], Rassegna di diritto pubblico europeo, gennaio 2016.</ref>}}\n\nThe Convention was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 in Rome. It was ratified and entered into force on 3 September 1953. It is overseen and enforced by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg, and the [[Council of Europe]]. Until procedural reforms in the late 1990s, the Convention was also overseen by a European Commission on Human Rights.\n\n==Drafting==\nThe Convention is drafted in broad terms, in a similar (albeit more modern) manner to the [[English Bill of Rights]], the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]], the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] or the first part of the German [[Grundgesetz|Basic law]]. Statements of principle are, from a legal point of view, not determinative and require extensive interpretation by courts to bring out meaning in particular factual situations.<ref>D. Vitkauskas, G.

A Handbook for Legal Practitioners. 2nd Edition, prepared by Dovydas Vitkauskas] Strasbourg, Council of Europe, 2017, pages 11-15</ref>\n\n==Convention articles==\nAs amended by Protocol 11, the Convention consists of three parts. The main rights and freedoms are contained in Section I, which consists of Articles 2 to 18. Section II (Articles 19 to 51) sets up the Court and its rules of operation. Section III contains various concluding provisions.\n\nBefore the entry into force of Protocol 11, Section II (Article 19) set up the Commission and the Court, Sections III (Articles 20 to 37) and IV (Articles 38 to 59) included the high-level machinery for the operation of, respectively, the Commission and the Court, and Section V contained various concluding provisions.\n\nMany of the Articles in Section I are structured in two paragraphs: the first sets out a basic right or freedom (such as Article 2(1) \u2013 the right to life) but the second contains various exclusions, exceptions or limitations on the basic right (such as Article 2(2) \u2013 which excepts certain uses of force leading to death).\n\n===Article 1 \u2013 respecting rights===\n\n{{Main article|Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 1 simply binds the signatory parties to secure the rights under the other Articles of the Convention \"within their jurisdiction\". In exceptional cases, \"jurisdiction\" may not be confined to a Contracting State's own national territory; the obligation to secure Convention rights then also extends to foreign territories, such as occupied land in which the State exercises effective control.\n\nIn ''[[Loizidou v Turkey]]'',<ref>(Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 EHRR 99</ref> the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that jurisdiction of member states to the convention extended to areas under that state's effective control as a result of military action.\n\n===Article 2 \u2013 life===\n\n{{Main article|Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 2 protects the right of every person to their life. The right to life extends only to human beings, not to non-human animals,<ref name=\"korff\">Korff, Douwe, ''The Right to Life: A Guide to the Implementation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Council of Europe \u2013 Human Rights Handbook No. 8, November 2006 )'', p. 10</ref> or to \"legal persons\" such as corporations.<ref name=\"korff\"/>  In ''[[Evans v United Kingdom]]'', the Court ruled that the question of whether the right to life extends to a human embryo fell within a state's [[margin of appreciation]]. In ''Vo v France'',<ref>[http://echr.ketse.com/doc/53924.00-en-20040708/view/ Vo V. France]. Echr.ketse.com. Retrieved on 12 July 2013.</ref> the Court declined to extend the right to life to an unborn child, while stating that \"it is neither desirable, nor even possible as matters stand, to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention\".<ref>''Vo v. France'', section 85 of the judgment</ref>\n\nThe Court has ruled that states have three main duties under Article 2:\n\n# a duty to refrain from unlawful killing,\n# a duty to investigate suspicious deaths, and\n# in certain circumstances, a positive duty to prevent foreseeable loss of life.<ref>Jacobs & White, p. 56</ref>\n\nThe first paragraph of the article contains an exception for [[Capital punishment|lawful execution]]s, although this exception has largely been superseded by Protocols 6 and 13. Protocol 6 prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in peacetime, while Protocol 13 extends the prohibition to all circumstances. (For more on Protocols 6 and 13, see [[#Protocol 13 \u2013 complete abolition of death penalty|below]]).\n\nThe second paragraph of Article 2 provides that death resulting from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is \"no more than absolutely necessary\".\n\nSignatory states to the Convention can only derogate from the rights contained in Article 2 for deaths which result from lawful acts of war.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights did not rule upon the right to life until 1995, when in ''[[McCann and Others v United Kingdom]]''<ref>(1995) 21 EHRR 97</ref> it ruled that the exception contained in the second paragraph does not constitute situations when it is permitted to kill, but situations where it is permitted to use force which might result in the deprivation of life.<ref>(1995) 21 EHRR 97 at para. 148</ref>\n\n===Article 3 \u2013 torture===\n\n{{Main article|Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 3 prohibits [[torture]] and \"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\". There are no exceptions or limitations on this right. This provision usually applies, apart from torture, to cases of severe police violence and poor conditions in detention.\n\nThe Court has emphasized the fundamental nature of Article 3 in holding that the prohibition is made in \"absolute terms&nbsp;... irrespective of a victim's conduct\".<ref>''[[Chahal v. United Kingdom]]'' (1997) 23 EHRR 413.</ref> The Court has also held that states cannot deport or [[extradition|extradite]] individuals who might be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in the recipient state.<ref>''[[Chahal v. United Kingdom]]'' (1997) 23 EHRR 413; ''[[Soering v. United Kingdom]]'' (1989) 11 EHRR 439.</ref>\n\nInitially, the Court took a restrictive view on what consisted of torture, preferring to find that states had inflicted inhuman and degrading treatment. Thus the court held that practices such as sleep deprivation, subjecting individual to intense noise and requiring them to stand against a wall with their limbs outstretched for extended periods of time, did not constitute torture.<ref>''[[Ireland v. United Kingdom]]'' (1979\u201380) 2 EHRR 25 at para 167.</ref> In fact the Court only found a state guilty of torture in 1996 in the case of a detainee who was suspended by his arms while his hands were tied behind his back.<ref>''Aksoy v. Turkey'' (1997) 23 EHRR 553. The process was referred to by the Court as \"Palestinian hanging\" but more commonly known as [[Strappado]].</ref> Since then the Court has appeared to be more open to finding states guilty of torture and has even ruled that since the Convention is a \"living instrument\", treatment which it had previously characterized as inhuman or degrading treatment might in future be regarded as torture.<ref>''Selmouni v. France'' (2000) 29 EHRR 403 at para. 101.</ref>\n\n===Article 4 \u2013 servitude===\n\n{{Main article|Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 4 prohibits [[slavery]], servitude and [[forced labour]] but exempts labour:\n* done as a normal part of imprisonment,\n* in the form of [[conscription|compulsory military service]] or work done as an alternative by conscientious objectors,\n* required to be done during a [[state of emergency]], and\n* considered to be a part of a person's normal \"civic obligations\".\n\n===Article 5 \u2013 liberty and security===\n\n{{Main article|Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. Liberty and security of the person are taken as a \"compound\" concept \u2013 security of the person has not been subject to separate interpretation by the Court.\n\nArticle 5 provides the right to [[liberty]], subject only to lawful arrest or detention under certain other circumstances, such as arrest on reasonable suspicion of a crime or imprisonment in fulfilment of a sentence. The article also provides those arrested with the right to be informed, in a language they understand, of the reasons for the arrest and any charge they face, the right of prompt access to judicial proceedings to determine the legality of the arrest or detention, to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, and the right to compensation in the case of arrest or detention in violation of this article.\n\n*[[Assanidze v. Georgia | Assanidze v. Georgia, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. 8 April 2004)]]\n\n===Article 6 \u2013 fair trial===\n\n{{Main article|Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 6 provides a detailed [[right to a fair trial]], including the right to a [[hearing (law)|public hearing]] before an independent and impartial tribunal within reasonable time, the [[presumption of innocence]], and other minimum rights for those charged with a criminal offence (adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, right to the free assistance of an interpreter).<ref>D.

Under the \"independent tribunal\" requirement, the Court has ruled that military judges in Turkish state security courts are incompatible with Article 6. In compliance with this Article, Turkey has now adopted a law abolishing these courts.\n\nAnother significant set of violations concerns the \"confrontation clause\" of Article 6 (i.e. the right to examine witnesses or have them examined). In this respect, problems of compliance with Article 6 may arise when national laws allow the use in evidence of the testimonies of absent, anonymous and vulnerable witnesses.\n\n*''[[McLibel Case|Steel v.

No person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offence at the time of its commission. The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law, which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time, so long as it was prohibited by [[public international law|international law]]. The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed.\n\nArticle 7 incorporates the legal principle ''[[nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege]]'' into the convention.\n\nRelevant cases are: \n*''[[Kokkinakis v. Greece]]'' [1993] ECHR 20 \n*''[[S.A.S. v. France]]'' [2014] ECHR 69\n\n===Article 8 \u2013 privacy===\n\n{{Main article|Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 8 provides a right to respect for one's \"private and family life, his home and his [[privacy of correspondence|correspondence]]\", subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\". This article clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for \"private and family life\" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the criminalisation of this may violate this article. However, the ECHR still deems such familial sexual acts to be criminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/33349.pdf|author=Roffee, J. A. (2014)|title=No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights}}</ref> This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the [[right to privacy]]. Furthermore, Article&nbsp;8 sometimes comprises [[positive obligations]]:<ref>''Von Hannover v Germany'' [2004] ECHR 294 (24 June 2004), European Court of Human Rights, para 57</ref> whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus ''not'' to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to ''do'' something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced parent to his/her child).\n\nNotable cases:\n* ''[[Zakharov v.

This right includes the freedom to hold opinions, and to receive and impart information and ideas, but allows restrictions for:\n* interests of national security\n* territorial integrity or public safety\n* prevention of disorder or crime\n* protection of health or morals\n* protection of the reputation or the rights of others\n* preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence\n* maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary\n\nRelevant cases are:\n*''[[Lingens v Austria]]'' (1986) 8 EHRR 407\n*''[[The Observer and The Guardian v United Kingdom]]'' (1991) 14 EHRR 153, the \"[[Spycatcher]]\" case.\n*''[[Bowman v United Kingdom]]'' [1998] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/4.html ECHR 4], (1998) 26 EHRR 1, distributing vast quantities of anti-abortion material in contravention to election spending laws\n*''[[Communist Party v Turkey]]'' (1998) 26 EHRR 1211\n*''[[Appleby v United Kingdom]]'' (2003) 37 EHRR 38, protests in a private shopping mall\n\n===Article 11 \u2013 association===\n\n{{Main article|Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 11 protects the right to [[freedom of assembly]] and association, including the right to form [[trade union]]s, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\".\n\n*''[[Vogt v Germany]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Yazar, Karatas, Aksoy and Hep v Turkey]]'' (2003) 36 EHRR 59\n\n===Article 12 \u2013 marriage===\n\n{{Main article|Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 12 provides a right for women and men of [[marriageable age]] to [[marry]] and establish a family.\n\nDespite a number of invitations, the Court has so far refused to apply the protections of this article to [[same-sex marriage]]. The Court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.\n\nIn ''[[Goodwin v United Kingdom]]'' the Court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative [[transsexual]] persons under their pre-operative sex, violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in ''[[Rees v United Kingdom]]''. This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'' that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples, however if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done so under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face: in order to prevent a breach of article 14 \u2013 the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of ''[[Oliari and Others v Italy]]'', that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is a specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.\n\n===Article 13 \u2013 effective remedy===\nArticle 13 provides for the right for an effective [[legal remedy|remedy]] before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately actionable infringement of the Convention.\n\n===Article 14 \u2013 discrimination===\nArticle 14 contains a prohibition of [[discrimination]]. This prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on \"sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status\", the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.\n\nAt the same time, the article's protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the Convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the Convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex \u2013 Article 14 \u2013 in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression \u2013 Article 10). It has been said that laws regarding familial sexual relationships (or incest) are in breach of Article 14 when combined with Article 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/33349.pdf|title=Roffee, J. A. (2014). No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights}}</ref>\n\nProtocol 12 extends this prohibition to cover discrimination in any legal right, even when that legal right is not protected under the Convention, so long as it is provided for in national law.\n\n===Article 15 \u2013 derogations===\nArticle 15 allows contracting states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the Convention in a time of \"war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\". Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:\n\n# there must be a public emergency threatening the life of the nation;\n# any measures taken in response must be \"strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\", and\n# the measures taken in response to it, must be in compliance with a state's other obligations under international law\n\nIn addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound. There must be some formal announcement of the derogation and notice of the derogation, any measures adopted under it, and the ending of the derogation must be communicated to the Secretary-General of the [[Council of Europe]]<ref>Article 15(3).</ref>\n\nAs of 2016, eight member states had ever invoked derogations.<ref>[http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Derogation_ENG.pdf Derogation in time of emergency] ECtHR Press Unit, 2016</ref> The Court is quite permissive in accepting a state's derogations from the Convention but applies a higher degree of scrutiny in deciding whether measures taken by states under a derogation are, in the words of Article 15, \"strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\". Thus in ''A&nbsp;v&nbsp;United Kingdom'', the Court dismissed a claim that a derogation lodged by the British government in response to the [[September 11 attacks]] was invalid, but went on to find that measures taken by the United Kingdom under that derogation were disproportionate.<ref>[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=002-1647 <nowiki>[2009]</nowiki> ECHR 301] paras. 181 and 190.</ref>\n\nIn order for a derogation itself to be valid, the emergency giving rise to it must be:\n* actual or imminent, although states do not have to wait for disasters to strike before taking preventive measures,<ref>''A v United Kingdom'' [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=002-1647 <nowiki>[2009]</nowiki> ECHR 301] para. 177.</ref>\n* involve the whole nation, although a threat confined to a particular region may be treated as \"threatening the life of the nation\" in that particular region,<ref>''Aksoy v.

This addresses instances where states seek to restrict a human right in the name of another human right, or where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).\n\n===Article 18 \u2013 permitted restrictions===\n{{main article|Article 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\nArticle 18 provides that any limitations on the rights provided for in the Convention may be used only for the purpose for which they are provided. For example, Article 5, which guarantees the right to personal freedom, may be explicitly limited in order to bring a suspect before a judge. To use pre-trial detention as a means of intimidation of a person under a false pretext is, therefore, a limitation of right (to freedom) which does not serve an explicitly provided purpose (to be brought before a judge), and is therefore contrary to Article 18.\n\n==Convention protocols==\n{{As of|January 2010}}, fifteen protocols to the Convention have been opened for signature. These can be divided into two main groups: those amending the framework of the convention system, and those expanding the rights that can be protected. The former require unanimous ratification by member states before coming into force, while the latter require a certain number of states to sign before coming into force.\n\n===Protocol 1===\nThis Protocol contains three different rights which the signatories could not agree to place in the Convention itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/009 |title=Full list |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> [[Monaco]] and [[Switzerland]] have signed but never ratified Protocol 1.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=009&CM=8&DF=21/02/2011&CL=ENG1st protocol signatory and ratification info], Council of Europe treaties office.</ref>\n\n====Article 1 \u2013 property====\nArticle 1 provides for the [[Right to property|right to the peaceful enjoyment of one's possessions]].

Although that Article does not impose a duty on the Contracting States to set up institutions of higher education, any State doing so will be under an obligation to afford an effective right of access to them. In a democratic society, the right to education, which is indispensable to the furtherance of human rights, plays such a fundamental role that a restrictive interpretation of the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 would not be consistent with the aim or purpose of that provision.<ref>''[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=789023&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Sahin v.

Several member states\u2014[[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Lithuania]], [[Monaco]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]\u2014have not signed the protocol.<ref>[https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/177/signatures].</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom government has declined to sign Protocol 12 on the basis that they believe the wording of protocol is too wide and would result in a flood of new cases testing the extent of the new provision. They believe that the phrase \"rights set forth by law\" might include international conventions to which the UK is not a party, and would result in incorporation of these instruments by stealth. It has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in a [[catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe's most populous states\u2014including the UK\u2014not to ratify the protocol.

These amendments have, with the exception of Protocol 2, amended the text of the convention.

All of these protocols have required the unanimous ratification of all the member states of the Council of Europe to enter into force.\n\n====Protocol 11====\nProtocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 have now been superseded by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=List of the treaties coming from the subject-matter: Human Rights (Convention and Protocols only) |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeTraites.asp?MA=3&CM=7&CL=ENG |accessdate=21 February 2009}}</ref> It established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. It abolished the Commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the Court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction and altered the latter's structure. Previously states could ratify the Convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.\n\n====Protocol 14====\nProtocol 14 follows on from Protocol 11 in proposing to further improve the efficiency of the Court. It seeks to \"filter\" out cases that have less chance of succeeding along with those that are broadly similar to cases brought previously against the same member state. Furthermore, a case will not be considered admissible where an applicant has not suffered a \"significant disadvantage\". This latter ground can only be used when an examination of the application on the merits is not considered necessary and where the subject-matter of the application had already been considered by a national court.\n\nA new mechanism was introduced by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The Committee can ask the Court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the Court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for [[European Union]] [[Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights#EU accession to ECHR|accession to the Convention]].<ref>See Article 17 of the [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/194.htm Protocol No. 14] amending Article 59 of the Convention.</ref> The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010.

Just days later on 16 August 1851, Lieutenant-Governor [[Charles La Trobe|Latrobe]] proclaimed in the Government Gazette crown rights for all mining proceeds and a licence fee of 30 shillings per month effective from 1 September 1851.<ref>[http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf Charles La Trobe, Victoria's Separation & Gold Tax \u2013 'turning a wild colonial country into a civilised one'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411072510/http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf |date=11 April 2013 }} Roy Morgan Research</ref>\n\nOn 26 August, a rally of 40\u201350 miners opposing the fee was held at Hiscock's gully \u2013 the first of many such protests in the colony.<ref name=\"Argus 30 Aug 1851\">GOLD.

The government hastily repealed its plans due to the reaction.\n\nNevertheless, the oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency causing general dissent among the diggers. In addition, Weston Bate noted that the Ballarat diggings were in strong opposition to the strict liquor licensing laws imposed by the government.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nChanges to the Goldfields Act in 1853 allowed licence searches to occur at any time which further incensed the diggers. In [[Bendigo]] in 1853, an [[Anti-Gold Licence Association]] was formed and the miners were apparently on the brink of an armed clash with authorities. Again in 1854, Bendigo miners responded to an increase in the frequency of twice weekly licence hunts with threats of armed rebellion.<ref>pg. 55. Bate, Weston.

Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.\n\n=== Peter Lalor ===\n{{Main|Peter Lalor}}\n[[File:Peter Lalor as Speaker.jpg|thumb|upright|Eureka leader [[Peter Lalor]] in later life as Speaker of the House in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. Only his right arm is visible, as his left arm was amputated as a result of the battle at Eureka.]]\nFollowing the battle, rebel leader, [[Irish Australian]] Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, \"There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Lalor\n |first       = Peter\n |authorlink  = Peter Lalor\n |title       = Peter Lalor's Narrative\n |work        = Eureka on Trial\n |publisher   = Public Record Office Victoria, (2003)\n |year        = 1855\n |url         = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |accessdate  = 21 February 2007\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409140744/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |archivedate = 9 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nLalor stood for [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|{{Notatypo|Ballaarat}}]] in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.\n\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\n\n==Political legacy==\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]].

The film is set in what was then the near-future year of 1997, in a crime-ridden [[United States]] that has converted [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] into the country's [[Types of US federal prisons|maximum security prison]]. When [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by terrorists and crashes into New York City, ex-soldier and federal prisoner [[Snake Plissken]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) is given 24 hours to rescue the [[President of the United States]].\n\nCarpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on an estimated budget of $6 million.<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/><ref name=\"Phantom\">{{cite news | author=Phantom of the Movies | title=''Escape From New York'' rushes into a DVD world | work=Washington Weekend | pages=M24 | publisher=[[Washington Times]] | date=December 11, 2003}}</ref> [[Debra Hill]] and [[Larry J.

The film was co-written by [[Nick Castle]], who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''.\n\n''Escape from New York'' was released in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/> The film was nominated for four [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]. The film became a [[cult classic]] and was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell but was much less favorably received.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the [[United States government]] has turned [[Manhattan]] into a giant [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum-security prison]]. A {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} containment wall surrounds the island, and routes out of Manhattan have been dismantled or [[Land mine|mined]], while armed helicopters patrol the rivers, and all prisoners there are sentenced to life, with no means of leaving.\n\nIn 1997, NATO is engaged in an escalating war with the USSR across much of Europe, which threatens to imminently become a global nuclear holocaust. While traveling to a peace summit between the [[United States]], [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a [[stewardess]]. The President is given a tracking bracelet and his briefcase (containing an audiotape describing the secret to using [[nuclear power|nuclear]] [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] for power generation) [[handcuff]]ed to his wrist \u2014 a move which could defuse hostilities and bring peace between the Superpowers. He makes it to an [[escape pod]], and lands in Manhattan just before Air Force One crashes, killing everyone else aboard.\n\nPolice are dispatched to rescue the President. However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York (the top [[crime boss]] in the prison) warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage, and that he will be killed if any further rescue attempts are mounted. Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to [[Snake Plissken]], a former [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces]] soldier convicted of attempting to rob the [[Federal Reserve]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]: if Snake rescues the President and retrieves the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a [[presidential pardon]]. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture Snake's [[carotid arteries]] within 22 hours; if Snake returns with the President and the tape in time, Hauk will have the explosives neutralized.\n\nSnake is sent into Manhattan in a [[stealth technology|stealth]] [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], landing atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. After many close brushes with death in one form or another, he tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet to a [[vaudeville]] theater, only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man. Convinced that the President has been killed, he radios Hauk, only to be told that he will be shot down if he tries to come back out empty-handed. Soon afterwards he meets \"Cabbie,\" a long-serving New York taxi-driver who has been driving the streets of Manhattan for 30 years and somehow managed to remain in the city after its conversion to an open prison. Cabbie takes Snake in his armored taxi cab to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an advisor to the Duke and a former associate of Snake's, who is a brilliant engineer and has established a base in New York Central Library with an oil-pumping engine and a small refinery, which keeps the remainder of the city's cars and machinery running. Hellman betrayed Snake during a long-ago robbery plot and Snake is tempted to shoot him, but Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to unify the gangs in a mass exodus across the heavily guarded [[Queensboro Bridge]], using the President as a human shield and a map Brain has created to avoid the landmines. Snake backs off, but forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at [[Grand Central Terminal]]. He finds the President, but is captured by the Duke's men.\n\nWhile Snake is forced to fight in a [[deathmatch]] with Slag, a prisoner, Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. As Snake kills Slag, the Duke learns of Brain's treachery and rallies his gang to chase them. Snake, Brain, Maggie, and the President race to the World Trade Center in an attempt to use Snake's glider to escape from Manhattan. After a group of crazies destroy it, the group returns to the street and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape (having traded it to Romero earlier for his hat), the President demands it, but Snake keeps it.\n\nThe Duke pursues the group onto the bridge in his customised Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. With Brain navigating through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him. She stands in the middle of the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall, and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead with one of the guard's machine guns. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.\n\nAs the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake for saving him and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake asks for is how he feels about the people who died saving him, but the President only offers half-hearted regret. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers Snake a job as his Deputy \u2014 Snake demures, neither saying yes or no. The President's speech commences, and he offers the contents of the cassette; to his embarrassment, the tape is Cabbie's cassette of the [[swing music|swing]] song \"[[Bandstand Boogie]]\". As Snake walks away, he intentionally tears the [[magnetic tape]], out of the real [[Compact Cassette|cassette reel]], with the actual message that was intended to be delivered by the President.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kurt Russell]] as [[Snake Plissken]]\n*[[Lee Van Cleef]] as Bob Hauk\n*[[Ernest Borgnine]] as Cabbie\n*[[Donald Pleasence]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n*[[Isaac Hayes]] as The Duke of [[New York City]]\n*[[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Harold \"Brain\" Hellman\n*[[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Maggie\n*[[Season Hubley]] as The Girl in the [[Chock Full o' Nuts]]\n*[[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Rehme\n*[[Charles Cyphers]] as the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]\n*[[Joe Unger]] as Taylor (scenes deleted)\n*[[Frank Doubleday (actor)|Frank Doubleday]] as Romero\n*John Strobel as Cronenberg\n*[[Nancy Stephens]] as Stewardess\n*[[Ox Baker]] as Slag\n*[[George Buck Flower|Buck Flower]] as Drunk\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nCarpenter originally wrote the screenplay for ''Escape from New York'' in 1976, in the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Carpenter said, \"The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President.

Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as \"a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of [[Bruce Lee]], [[The Exterminator]], and [[Darth Vader]], with [[Clint Eastwood|Eastwood]]'s vocal-ness.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hogan |first=Richard |title=Kurt Russell Rides a New Wave in ''Escape'' Film |pages= |magazine=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]] |year=1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172535/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 |df= }}</ref> All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is \"the next 60 seconds.

He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the [[eyepatch]] between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his [[depth perception]].<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\">{{cite journal|last=Goldberg |first=Lee |title=Kurt Russell&nbsp;\u2014 Two-Fisted Hero |pages= |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=108 |date=July 1986 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nCarpenter had just made ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making ''Escape'' later. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', Avco-Embassy signed him and producer [[Debra Hill]] to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was ''[[The Fog]]''. Initially, the second film  he was going to make to finish the contract was ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (movie)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]'', but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, \"This was basically a straight [[action film]].

The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. \"We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up.

The story takes place sometime between ''Escape from New York'' and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in ''Escape from L.A.'' Snake has robbed Atlanta's Center for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that's really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called A.T.A.C.S. (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when A.T.A.C.S. copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, A.T.A.C.S. sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As A.T.A.C.S. shuts down, it can only ask him, \"Why?\" Snake just walks off answering, \"I don't need the competition\".\n\nIn 2003, [[CrossGen]] published ''[[John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles (comics)|John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles]]'', a four-part [[comic book]] miniseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2168 |title=Snake Strikes Early!

Snake has been given a military [[Humvee]] after his presidential pardon and makes his way to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Although the director's cut of ''Escape from New York'' shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, ''[[Captain Ron]]''). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed [[shootout]]. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying [[Jackie Kennedy]], leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.\n\nIn 2014, [[BOOM!

Ethylene is known for regulating plant growth and development and adapted to stress conditions. Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even when there is no stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and the plant will not be able to cope with the abiotic stress. EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on ''Arabidopsis'' plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Gang|last2=Shen|first2=Ming|last3=Li|first3=Zhi-Gang|last4=Zhang|first4=Bo|last5=Duan|first5=Kai-Xuan|last6=Wang|first6=Ning|last7=Cao|first7=Yang-Rong|last8=Zhang|first8=Wan-Ke|last9=Ma|first9=Biao|date=2011-10-01|title=EIN2 regulates salt stress response and interacts with a MA3 domain-containing protein ECIP1 in Arabidopsis|journal=Plant, Cell & Environment|language=en|volume=34|issue=10|pages=1678\u20131692|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02363.x|pmid=21631530|issn=1365-3040}}</ref> These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development.\n\n===Environmental and biological triggers of ethylene===\nEnvironmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants.

The development of the corolla is directed in part by ethylene, though its concentration is highest when the plant is fertilized and no longer requires the production or maintenance of structures and compounds that attract pollinators.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Hong|title=Transcriptome profiling reveals regulatory mechanisms underlying corolla senescence in petunia|journal=Horticulture Research|date=2018|volume=5|issue=16|pages=16|pmc=5878830|pmid=29619227|doi=10.1038/s41438-018-0018-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Underwood|first1=Beverly|title=Ethylene-Regulated Floral Volatile Synthesis in Petunia Corollas|journal=Plant Physiology|date=May 2005|volume=138|issue=1|pages=255\u2013266|doi=10.1104/pp.104.051144|pmid=15849311|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/138/1/255.long#ref-12|pmc=1104180}}</ref> The role of ethylene in the developmental cycle is as a hormonal director of [[Plant senescence|senescence]] in corolla tissue. This is evident as ethylene production and emission are maximized in developmental phases post-pollination, until corolla wilting.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/> Ethylene-directed senescence of corolla tissue can be observed as color change in the corolla or the wilting/ death of corolla tissue. At the chemical level, ethylene mediates the reduction in the amount of fragrance volatiles produced. Fragrance volatiles act mostly by attracting pollinators. Ethylene's role in this developmental scenario is to move the plant away from a state of attracting pollinators, so it also aids in decreasing the production of these volatiles.\n\nEthylene production in corolla tissue does not directly cause the senescence of corolla tissue, but acts by releasing secondary products that are consistent with tissue aging. While the mechanism of ethylene-mediated senescence are unclear, its role as a senescence-directing hormone can be confirmed by ethylene-sensitive petunia response to ethylene knockdown. Knockdown of ethylene biosynthesis genes was consistent with increased corolla longevity; inversely, up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis gene transcription factors were consistent with a more rapid senescence of the corolla.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n====List of plant responses to ethylene====\n* Seedling triple response, thickening and shortening of [[hypocotyl]] with pronounced apical hook.\n* Stimulation of ''Arabidopsis'' hypocotyl elongation <ref>Debatosh Das,[http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/early/2016/06/21/pp.16.00725.abstract \"Ethylene- and shade-induced hypocotyl elongation share transcriptome patterns and functional regulators\"], \"Plant Physiology\",21-06-2016</ref>\n* In [[pollination]], when the pollen reaches the stigma, the precursor of the ethene, [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|ACC]], is secreted to the petal, the ACC releases ethylene with ACC oxidase.\n* Stimulates leaf [[senescence]]\n* Stimulates senescence of mature [[xylem]] cells in preparation for plant use\n* Induces leaf [[abscission]]\n* Induces seed [[germination]]\n* Induces [[root hair]] growth \u2014 increasing the efficiency of water and mineral absorption\n* Induces the growth of [[adventitious root]]s during flooding\n* Stimulates epinasty \u2014 leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] grows out, leaf hangs down and curls into itself\n* Stimulates [[fruit ripening]]\n* Induces a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] rise in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] in some fruit which causes a release of additional ethylene.\n* Affects [[gravitropism]]\n* Stimulates nutational bending\n* Inhibits stem growth and stimulates stem and cell broadening and lateral branch growth outside of seedling stage (see [[Hyponastic response]])\n* Interference with [[auxin]] transport (with high [[auxin]] concentrations)\n* Inhibits shoot growth and [[stoma]]tal closing except in some water plants or habitually flooded ones such as some rice varieties, where the opposite occurs (conserving {{chem|CO|2}} and {{chem|O|2}})\n* Induces flowering in [[pineapple]]s\n* Inhibits short day induced flower initiation in ''Pharbitus nil''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilmowicz E, Kesy J, Kopcewicz J |title=Ethylene and ABA interactions in the regulation of flower induction in ''Pharbitis nil'' |journal=J.

Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berenddeboer.net/eiffel/archive/halstenbach_eiffel_history.html|title=Eiffel \u2014 the Language|last1= |first1= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> the first version becoming available in 1986. In 2005, Eiffel became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]-standardized language.\n\nThe design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including [[design by contract]], [[command\u2013query separation]], the [[Uniform access principle|uniform-access principle]], the [[Single choice principle|single-choice principle]], the [[Open/closed principle|open\u2013closed principle]], and [[option\u2013operand separation]].\n\nMany concepts initially introduced by Eiffel later found their way into [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and other languages.<ref>Formal Specification Languages: Eiffel, Denotational Semantics, Vienna Development Method, Abstract Machine Notation, Petri Net, General Books, 2010</ref> New language design ideas, particularly through the [[Ecma International|Ecma]]/[[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] standardization process, continue to be incorporated into the Eiffel language.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nThe key characteristics of the Eiffel language include:\n\n* An object-oriented program structure in which a class serves as the basic unit of decomposition.\n* [[Design by contract]] tightly integrated with other language constructs.\n* Automatic memory management, typically implemented by [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].\n* [[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]], including [[multiple inheritance]], [[wikt:renaming|renaming]], [[Method overriding|redefinition]], \"select\", [http://docs.eiffel.com/book/method/et-inheritance#Non-conforming_inheritance non-conforming inheritance], and other mechanisms intended to make inheritance safe.\n* Constrained and unconstrained [[generic programming]]\n* A uniform type system handling both value and reference semantics in which all types, including basic types such as INTEGER, are class-based.\n* [[Static typing]]\n* Void safety, or static protection against calls on null references, through the attached-types mechanism.\n* Agents, or objects that wrap computations, closely connected with [[Closure (computer science)|closure]]s and [[lambda calculus]].\n* ''Once'' routines, or routines evaluated only once, for object sharing and decentralized initialization.\n* Keyword-based syntax in the [[ALGOL]]/[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] tradition but separator-free, insofar as semicolons are optional, with operator syntax available for routines.\n* Case insensitivity\n* Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming ([[SCOOP (software)|SCOOP]]) facilitates creation of multiple, concurrently active execution vehicles at a level of abstraction above the specific details of these vehicles (e.g. multiple threads without specific mutex management).\n\n==Design goals==\nEiffel emphasizes declarative statements over procedural code and attempts to eliminate the need for bookkeeping instructions.\n\nEiffel shuns coding tricks or coding techniques intended as [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] hints to the compiler. The aim is not only to make the code more readable, but also to allow programmers to concentrate on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. Eiffel's simplicity is intended to promote simple, extensible, reusable, and reliable answers to computing problems. Compilers for computer programs written in Eiffel provide extensive optimization techniques, such as automatic in-lining, that relieve the programmer of part of the optimization burden.\n\n===Background===\nEiffel was originally developed by [[Eiffel Software]], a company founded by [[Bertrand Meyer]]. ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]'' contains a detailed treatment of the concepts and theory of the object technology that led to Eiffel's design.<ref>''Object-Oriented Software Construction'', Second Edition, by [[Bertrand Meyer]], Prentice Hall, 1997, {{ISBN|0-13-629155-4}}</ref>\n\nThe design goal behind the Eiffel language, libraries, and programming methods is to enable programmers to create reliable, reusable software modules. Eiffel supports [[multiple inheritance]], [[genericity]], [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], [[encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]], type-safe conversions, and [[parameter covariance]]. Eiffel's most important contribution to [[software engineering]] is [[design by contract]] (DbC), in which [[assertion (computing)|assertions]], [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s, and [[class invariant]]s are employed to help ensure program correctness without sacrificing efficiency.\n\nEiffel's design is based on object-oriented programming theory, with only minor influence of other paradigms or concern for support of legacy code. Eiffel formally supports [[abstract data type]]s. Under Eiffel's design, a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself, using a formalized implementation of the \"Abstract Data Type\".\n\n===Implementations and environments===\n[[EiffelStudio]] is an [[integrated development environment]] available under either an [[open-source|open source]] or a commercial license. It offers an object-oriented environment for [[software engineering]]. EiffelEnvision is a plug-in for [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that allows users to edit, compile, and debug Eiffel projects from within the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Five other [[open-source|open source]] implementations are available: [http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tecomp \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp]; Gobo Eiffel; [[SmartEiffel]], the GNU implementation, based on an older version of the language; [[LibertyEiffel]], based on the SmartEiffel compiler; and [[Visual Eiffel]].\n\nSeveral other programming languages incorporate elements first introduced in Eiffel. [[Sather]], for example, was originally based on Eiffel but has since diverged, and now includes several [[functional programming]] features. The interactive-teaching language [[Blue (programming language)|Blue]], forerunner of [[BlueJ]], is also Eiffel-based. The [[Apple Media Tool]] includes an Eiffel-based Apple Media Language.\n\n===Specifications and standards===\nThe Eiffel language definition is an international standard of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The standard was developed by [[European Computer Manufacturers Association|ECMA International]], which first approved the standard on 21 June 2005 as Standard ECMA-367, <cite>Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language</cite>. In June 2006, ECMA and ISO adopted the second version. In November 2006, ISO first published that version. The standard can be found and used free of charge on the ECMA site.<ref>ECMA International: <cite>Standard ECMA-367 \u2014Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language 2nd edition (June 2006)</cite>; available online at [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm]</ref> The ISO version<ref>International Organisation for Standardisation: <cite>Standard ISO/IEC DIS 25436</cite>, available online at [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=42924&ICS1=35&ICS2=60&ICS3=]</ref> is identical in all respects except formatting.\n\nEiffel Software, \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp and Eiffel-library-developer Gobo have committed to implementing the standard; Eiffel Software's EiffelStudio 6.1 and \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp implement some of the major new mechanisms\u2014in particular, inline agents, assigner commands, bracket notation, non-conforming inheritance, and attached types. The [[SmartEiffel]] team has turned away from this standard to create its own version of the language, which they believe to be closer to the original style of Eiffel. Object Tools has not disclosed whether future versions of its Eiffel compiler will comply with the standard. [[LibertyEiffel]] implements a dialect somewhere in between the [[SmartEiffel]] language and the standard.\n\nThe standard cites the following, predecessor Eiffel-language specifications:\n\n* Bertrand Meyer: <cite>Eiffel: The Language</cite>, Prentice Hall, second printing, 1992 (first printing: 1991)\n* Bertrand Meyer: <cite>Standard Eiffel</cite> (revision of preceding entry), ongoing, 1997\u2013present, at [http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl <cite>Bertrand Meyer's ETL3 page</cite>], and\n* Bertrand Meyer: <cite>Object-Oriented Software Construction</cite>, Prentice Hall: first edition, 1988; second edition, 1997.\n* Bertrand Meyer: <cite>Touch of Class: Learning to Program Well with Objects and Contracts</cite>, Springer-Verlag, 2009 {{ISBN|978-3-540-92144-8}} lxiv + 876 pages Full-color printing, numerous color photographs\n\nThe current version of the standard from June 2006 contains some inconsistencies (e.g. covariant redefinitions){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The ECMA committee has not yet announced any timeline and direction on how to resolve the inconsistencies.\n\n==Syntax and semantics==\n\n===Overall structure===\nAn Eiffel \"system\" or \"program\" is a collection of ''classes''. Above the level of classes, Eiffel defines ''cluster'', which is essentially a group of classes, and possibly of ''subclusters'' (nested clusters). Clusters are not a syntactic [[language construct]], but rather a standard organizational convention. Typically an Eiffel program will be organized with each class in a separate file, and each cluster in a directory containing class files. In this organization, subclusters are subdirectories. For example, under standard organizational and casing conventions, <code>x.e</code> might be the name of a file that defines a class called X.\n\nA class contains ''features'', which are similar to \"routines\", \"members\", \"attributes\" or \"methods\" in other object-oriented programming languages. A class also defines its invariants, and contains other properties, such as a \"notes\" section for documentation and metadata. Eiffel's standard data types, such as <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>STRING</code> and <code>ARRAY</code>, are all themselves classes.\n\nEvery system must have a class designated as \"root\", with one of its creation procedures designated as \"root procedure\". Executing a system consists of creating an instance of the root class and executing its root procedure. Generally, doing so creates new objects, calls new features, and so on.\n\nEiffel has five basic executable instructions: assignment, object creation, routine call, condition, and iteration. Eiffel's control structures are strict in enforcing structured programming: every block has exactly one entry and exactly one exit.\n\n====Scoping====\nUnlike many object-oriented languages, but like [[Smalltalk]], Eiffel does not permit any assignment into attributes of objects, except within the features of an object, which is the practical application of the principle of [[information hiding]] or data abstraction, requiring formal interfaces for data mutation. To put it in the language of other object-oriented programming languages, all Eiffel attributes are \"protected\", and \"setters\" are needed for client objects to modify values. An upshot of this is that \"setters\" can, and normally do, implement the invariants for which Eiffel provides syntax.\n\nWhile Eiffel does not allow direct access to the features of a class by a client of the class, it does allow for the definition of an \"assigner command\", such as:\n\n    <span style=\"color:green\">some_attribute</span>: <span style=\"color:blue\">SOME_TYPE</span> '''<span style=\"color:blue\">assign</span>''' set_some_attribute\n    \n    <span style=\"color:green\">set_some_attribute</span> (v: <span style=\"color:blue\">VALUE_TYPE</span>)\n                <span style=\"color:brown\">-- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.</span>\n            '''<span style=\"color:blue\">do</span>'''\n                some_attribute := v\n            '''<span style=\"color:blue\">end</span>'''\n\nWhile a slight bow to the overall developer community to allow something looking like direct access (e.g. thereby breaking the Information Hiding Principle), the practice is dangerous as it hides or obfuscates the reality of a \"setter\" being used. In practice, it is better to redirect the call to a setter rather than implying a direct access to a feature like <code>some_attribute</code> as in the example code above.\n\nUnlike other languages, having notions of \"public\", \"protected\", \"private\" and so on, Eiffel uses an exporting technology to more precisely control the scoping between client and supplier classes. Feature visibility is checked statically at compile-time. For example, (below), the \"{NONE}\" is similar to \"protected\" in other languages. Scope applied this way to a \"feature set\" (e.g. everything below the 'feature' keyword to either the next feature set keyword or the end of the class) can be changed in descendant classes using the \"export\" keyword.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nfeature {NONE} -- Initialization\n\tdefault_create\n\t\t\t-- Initialize a new `zero' decimal instance.\n\t\tdo\n\t\t\tmake_zero\n\t\tend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAlternatively, the lack of a {x} export declaration implies {ANY} and is similar to the \"public\" scoping of other languages.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nfeature -- Constants\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nFinally, scoping can be selectively and precisely controlled to any class in the Eiffel project universe, such as:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nfeature {DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER} -- Access\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the compiler will allow only the classes listed between the curly braces to access the features within the feature group (e.g. <tt>DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER</tt>).\n\n====\"Hello, world!\"====\nA programming language's look and feel is often conveyed using a [[Hello world program|\"Hello, world!\"]] program. Such a program written in Eiffel might be:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nclass\n    HELLO_WORLD\ncreate\n    make\nfeature\n    make\n        do\n            print (\"Hello, world!%N\")\n        end\nend \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis program contains the class <code>HELLO_WORLD</code>. The constructor (create routine) for the class, named <code>make</code>, invokes the <code>print</code> system library routine to write a <code>\"Hello,</code>&nbsp;<code>world!\"</code> message to the output.\n\n===Design by contract===\n{{Main article|Design by contract}}\nThe concept of Design by Contract is central to Eiffel. The contracts assert what must be true before a routine is executed (precondition) and what must hold to be true after the routine finishes (post-condition). Class Invariant contracts define what assertions must hold true both before and after any feature of a class is accessed (both routines and attributes). Moreover, contracts codify into executable code developer and designers assumptions about the operating environment of the features of a class or the class as a whole by means of the invariant.\n\nThe Eiffel compiler is designed to include the feature and class contracts in various levels. EiffelStudio, for example, executes all feature and class contracts during execution in the \"Workbench mode.\" When an executable is created, the compiler is instructed by way of the project settings file (e.g. ECF file) to either include or exclude any set of contracts. Thus, an executable file can be compiled to either include or exclude any level of contract, thereby bringing along continuous levels of unit and integration testing. Moreover, contracts can be continually and methodically exercised by way of the [http://docs.eiffel.com/book/eiffelstudio/autotest Auto-Test] feature found in EiffelStudio.\n\nThe Design by Contract mechanisms are tightly integrated with the language and guide redefinition of features in inheritance:\n\n* Routine precondition: The precondition may only be weakened by inheritance; any call that meets the requirements of the ancestor meets those of the descendant.\n* Routine postcondition: The postcondition can only be strengthened by inheritance; any result guaranteed by the ancestor is still provided by the descendant.\n* Class invariant: Conditions that must hold true after the object's creation and after any call to an exported class routine. Because the invariant is checked so often, it makes it simultaneously the most expensive and most powerful form of condition or contract.\n\nIn addition, the language supports a \"check instruction\" (a kind of \"assert\"), loop invariants, and loop variants (which guarantee loop termination).\n\n===Void-safety===\n[[Void safety|Void-safety]], like static typing, is another facility for improving software quality. Void-safe software is protected from run time errors caused by calls to [[null reference|void references]], and therefore will be more reliable than software in which calls to void targets can occur. The analogy to static typing is a useful one. In fact, void-safe capability could be seen as an extension to the type system, or a step beyond static typing, because the mechanism for ensuring void-safety is integrated into the type system.\n\nThe guard against void target calls can be seen by way of the notion of attachment and (by extension) detachment (e.g. detachable keyword). The void-safe facility can be seen in a short re-work of the example code used above:\n\n    <span style=\"color:green\">some_attribute</span>: '''<span style=\"color:blue\">detachable</span>''' <span style=\"color:blue\">SOME_TYPE</span>\n    \n    <span style=\"color:green\">use_some_attribute</span>\n                <span style=\"color:brown\">-- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.</span>\n            '''<span style=\"color:blue\">do</span>'''\n                if '''<span style=\"color:blue\">attached</span>''' some_attribute '''<span style=\"color:blue\">as</span>''' l_attribute '''<span style=\"color:blue\">then</span>'''\n                    do_something (l_attribute)\n                end\n            '''<span style=\"color:blue\">end</span>'''\n    \n    <span style=\"color:green\">do_something</span> (a_value: SOME_TYPE)\n                <span style=\"color:brown\">-- Do something with `a_value'.</span>\n            '''<span style=\"color:blue\">do</span>'''\n               ... doing something with `a_value' ...\n            '''<span style=\"color:blue\">end</span>'''\n\nThe code example above shows how the compiler can statically address the reliability of whether <code>some_attribute</code> will be attached or detached at the point it is used. Notably, the <code>attached</code> keyword allows for an \"attachment local\" (e.g. <code>l_attribute</code>), which is scoped to only the block of code enclosed by the if-statement construct. Thus, within this small block of code, the local variable (e.g. <code>l_attribute</code>) can be statically guaranteed to be non-void (i.e. void-safe).\n\n===Features: commands and queries===\nThe primary characteristic of a class is that it defines a set of features: as a class represents a set of run-time objects, or \"instances\", a feature is an operation on these objects. There are two kinds of features: queries and commands. A query provides information about an instance. A command modifies an instance.\n\nThe command-query distinction is important to the Eiffel method. In particular:\n\n* [[Uniform-Access Principle]]: from the point of view of a software client making a call to a class feature, whether a query is an attribute (field value) or a function (computed value) should not make any difference. For example, <code>a_vehicle.speed</code> could be an attribute accessed on the object <code>a_vehicle</code>, or it could be computed by a function that divides distance by time. The notation is the same in both cases, so that it is easy to change the class's implementation without affecting client software.\n* [[Command-Query Separation|Command-Query Separation Principle]]: Queries must not modify the instance. This is not a language rule but a methodological principle. So in good Eiffel style, one does not find \"get\" functions that change something and return a result; instead there are commands (procedures) to change objects, and queries to obtain information about the object, resulting from preceding changes.\n\n===Overloading===\nEiffel does not allow argument [[Method overloading|overloading]]. Each feature name within a class always maps to a specific feature within the class. One name, within one class, means one thing. This design choice helps the readability of classes, by avoiding a cause of ambiguity about which routine will be invoked by a call. It also simplifies the language mechanism; in particular, this is what makes Eiffel's multiple inheritance mechanism possible.<ref>Bertrand Meyer: Overloading vs Object Technology, in Journal of Object-Oriented Programming (JOOP), vol. 14, no. 4, October\u2013November 2001, available [http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/joop/overloading.pdf online]</ref>\n\nNames can, of course, be reused in different classes. For example, the feature <tt>plus</tt> (along with its infix [[#Operator and bracket syntax, assigner commands|alias]] <tt>\"+\"</tt>) is defined in several classes: <tt>INTEGER</tt>, <tt>REAL</tt>, <tt>STRING</tt>, etc.\n\n===Genericity===\n{{See also|Generic programming#Genericity in Eiffel}}\n\nA generic class is a class that varies by type (e.g. LIST [PHONE], a list of phone numbers; ACCOUNT [G->ACCOUNT_TYPE], allowing for ACCOUNT [SAVINGS] and ACCOUNT [CHECKING], etc.). Classes can be generic, to express that they are parameterized by types. Generic parameters appear in square brackets:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nclass LIST [G] ...\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nG is known as a \"formal generic parameter\". (Eiffel reserves \"argument\" for routines, and uses \"parameter\" only for generic classes.) With such a declaration G represents within the class an arbitrary type; so a function can return a value of type G, and a routine can take an argument of that type:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nitem: G do ... end\nput (x: G) do ... end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe <code>LIST [INTEGER]</code> and <code>LIST [WORD]</code> are \"generic derivations\" of this class. Permitted combinations (with <code>n: INTEGER</code>, <code>w: WORD</code>, <code>il: LIST [INTEGER]</code>, <code>wl: LIST [WORD]</code>) are:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nn := il.item\nwl.put (w)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<code>INTEGER</code> and <code>WORD</code> are the \"actual generic parameters\" in these generic derivations.\n\nIt is also possible to have 'constrained' formal parameters, for which the actual parameter must inherit from a given class, the \"constraint\". For example, in\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   class HASH_TABLE [G, KEY -> HASHABLE]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\na derivation <code>HASH_TABLE [INTEGER, STRING]</code> is valid only if <code>STRING</code> inherits from <code>HASHABLE</code> (as it indeed does in typical Eiffel libraries). Within the class, having <code>KEY</code> constrained by <code>HASHABLE</code> means that for <code>x: KEY</code> it is possible to apply to <code>x</code> all the features of <code>HASHABLE</code>, as in <code>x.hash_code</code>.\n\n===Inheritance basics===\nTo inherit from one or more others, a class will include an <code>inherit</code> clause at the beginning:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nclass C inherit\n   A\n   B\n\n-- ... Rest of class declaration ...\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe class may redefine (override) some or all of the inherited features. This must be explicitly announced at the beginning of the class through a <code>redefine</code> subclause of the inheritance clause, as in\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nclass C inherit\n    A\n        redefine f, g, h end\n    B\n        redefine u, v end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/online/eiffel50/intro/language/tutorial-10.html |title=9 INHERITANCE |publisher=Archive.eiffel.com |date=1997-03-23 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}</ref> for a complete discussion of Eiffel inheritance.\n\n===Deferred classes and features===\nClasses may be defined with <code>deferred class</code> rather than with <code>class</code> to indicate that the class may not be directly instantiated. Non-instantiatable classes are called [[abstract class]]es in some other object-oriented programming languages. In Eiffel parlance, only an \"effective\" class can be instantiated (it may be a descendent of a deferred class). A feature can also be deferred by using the <code>deferred</code> keyword in place of a <code>do</code> clause. If a class has any deferred features it must be declared as deferred; however, a class with no deferred features may nonetheless itself be deferred.\n\nDeferred classes play some of the same role as interfaces in languages such as Java, though many object-oriented programming theorists believe interfaces are themselves largely an answer to Java's lack of multiple inheritance (which Eiffel has).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artima.com/intv/abcs.html |title=Multiple Inheritance and Interfaces |publisher=Artima.com |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MultipleInheritanceIsNotEvil |title=Multiple Inheritance Is Not Evil |publisher=C2.com |date=2007-04-28 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}</ref>\n\n===Renaming===\nA class that inherits from one or more others gets all its features, by default under their original names. It may, however, change their names through <code>rename</code> clauses. This is required in the case of multiple inheritance if there are name clashes between inherited features; without renaming, the resulting class would violate the no-overloading principle noted above and hence would be invalid.\n\n===Tuples===\nTuples types may be viewed as a simple form of class, providing only attributes and the corresponding \"setter\" procedure. A typical tuple type reads\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   TUPLE [name: STRING; weight: REAL; date: DATE]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nand could be used to describe a simple notion of birth record if a class is not needed. An instance of such a tuple is simply a sequence of values with the given types, given in brackets, such as\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   [\"Brigitte\", 3.5, Last_night]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nComponents of such a tuple can be accessed as if the tuple tags were attributes of a class, for example if <code>t</code> has been assigned the above tuple then <code>t.weight</code> has value 3.5.\n\nThanks to the notion of assigner command (see below), dot notation can also be used to assign components of such a tuple, as in\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   t.weight := t.weight + 0.5\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe tuple tags are optional, so that it is also possible to write a tuple type as <code>TUPLE [STRING, REAL, DATE]</code>. (In some compilers this is the only form of tuple, as tags were introduced with the ECMA standard.)\n\nThe precise specification of e.g. <code>TUPLE [A, B, C]</code> is that it describes sequences of ''at least'' three elements, the first three being of types <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> respectively. As a result, <code>TUPLE [A, B, C]</code> conforms to (may be assigned to) <code>TUPLE [A, B]</code>, to <code>TUPLE [A]</code> and to <code>TUPLE</code> (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform.\n\n===Agents===\nEiffel's \"agent\" mechanism wraps operations into objects. This mechanism can be used for iteration, [[event-driven programming]], and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. Other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize [[functional programming]], allow a similar pattern using [[continuations]], [[closure (computer science)|closures]], or [[generator (computer science)|generators]]; Eiffel's agents emphasize the language's object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in [[Smalltalk]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].\n\nFor example, to execute the <code>my_action</code> block for each element of <code>my_list</code>, one would write:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   my_list.do_all (agent my_action)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTo execute <code>my_action</code> only on elements satisfying <code>my_condition</code>, a limitation/filter can be added:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   my_list.do_if (agent my_action, agent my_condition)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn these examples, <code>my_action</code> and <code>my_condition</code> are routines. Prefixing them with <code>agent</code> yields an object that represents the corresponding routine with all its properties, in particular the ability to be called with the appropriate arguments. So if <code>a</code> represents that object (for example because <code>a</code> is the argument to <code>do_all</code>), the instruction\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   a.call ([x])\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nwill call the original routine with the argument <code>x</code>, as if we had directly called the original routine: <code>my_action (x)</code>. Arguments to <code>call</code> are passed as a tuple, here <code>[x]</code>.\n\nIt is possible to keep some arguments to an agent '''open''' and make others '''closed'''. The open arguments are passed as arguments to <code>call</code>: they are provided at the time of ''agent use''. The closed arguments are provided at the time of agent ''definition''. For example, if <code>action2</code> has two arguments, the iteration\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   my_list.do_all (agent action2 (?, y))\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\niterates <code>action2 (x, y)</code> for successive values of <code>x</code>, where the second argument remains set to <code>y</code>. The question mark <code>?</code> indicates an open argument; <code>y</code> is a closed argument of the agent. Note that the basic syntax <code>agent f</code> is a shorthand for <code>agent f (?, ?, ...)</code> with all arguments open. It is also possible to make the ''target'' of an agent open through the notation <code>{T}?</code> where <code>T</code> is the type of the target.\n\nThe distinction between open and closed operands (operands = arguments + target) corresponds to the distinction between bound and free variables in [[lambda calculus]]. An agent expression such as <code>action2 (?, y)</code> with some operands closed and some open corresponds to a version of the original operation ''[[currying|curried]]'' on the closed operands.\n\nThe agent mechanism also allows defining an agent without reference to an existing routine (such as <code>my_action</code>, <code>my_condition</code>, <code>action2</code>), through inline agents as in\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nmy_list.do_all (agent (s: STRING)\n     require\n         not_void: s /= Void\n     do\n         s.append_character (',')\n     ensure\n         appended: s.count = old s.count + 1\n     end)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe inline agent passed here can have all the trappings of a normal routine, including precondition, postcondition, rescue clause (not used here), and a full signature. This avoids defining routines when all that's needed is a computation to be wrapped in an agent. This is useful in particular for contracts, as in an invariant clause that expresses that all elements of a list are positive:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   my_list.for_all (agent (x: INTEGER): BOOLEAN do Result := (x > 0) end)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe current agent mechanism leaves a possibility of run-time type error (if a routine with ''n'' arguments is passed to an agent expecting ''m'' arguments with ''m'' < ''n''). This can be avoided by a run-time check through the precondition <code>valid_arguments</code> of <code>call</code>. Several proposals for a purely static correction of this problem are available, including a language change proposal by Ribet et al.<ref>Philippe Ribet, Cyril Adrian, Olivier Zendra, Dominique Colnet: ''Conformance of agents in the Eiffel language'', in ''[[JOT: Journal of Object Technology|Journal of Object Technology]]'', vol. 3, no. 4, April 2004, Special issue: TOOLS USA 2003, pp. 125-143. Available on line from the [http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2004_04/article7 JOT article page]</ref>\n\n===Once routines===\nA routine's result can be cached using the <code>once</code> keyword in place of <code>do</code>. Non-first calls to a routine require no additional computation or resource allocation, but simply return a previously computed result. A common pattern for \"once functions\" is to provide shared objects; the first call will create the object, subsequent ones will return the reference to that object. The typical scheme is:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nshared_object: SOME_TYPE\n    once\n        create Result.make (args)\n             -- This creates the object and returns a reference to it through `Result'.\n    end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe returned object\u2014<code>Result</code> in the example\u2014can itself be mutable, but its reference remains the same.\n\nOften \"once routines\" perform a required initialization: multiple calls to a library can include a call to the initialization procedure, but only the first such call will perform the required actions. Using this pattern initialization can be decentralized, avoiding the need for a special initialization module. \"Once routines\" are similar in purpose and effect to the [[singleton pattern]] in many programming languages, and to the [[b:Computer Science Design Patterns/Singleton#Python|Borg pattern]] used in Python.\n\nBy default, a \"once routine\" is called ''once per thread''. The semantics can be adjusted to ''once per process'' or ''once per object'' by qualifying it with a \"once key\", e.g. <code>once (\"PROCESS\")</code>.\n\n===Conversions===\nEiffel provides a mechanism to allow conversions between various types. The mechanisms coexists with inheritance and complements it. To avoid any confusion between the two mechanisms, the design enforces the following principle:\n\n: '''(Conversion principle) A type may not both conform and convert to another.'''\n\nFor example, <code>NEWSPAPER</code> may conform to <code>PUBLICATION</code>, but <code>INTEGER</code> converts to <code>REAL</code> (and does not inherit from it).\n\nThe conversion mechanism simply generalizes the ad hoc conversion rules (such as indeed between <code>INTEGER</code> and <code>REAL</code>) that exist in most programming languages, making them applicable to any type as long as the above principle is observed. For example, a <code>DATE</code> class may be declared to convert to <code>STRING</code>; this makes it possible to create a string from a date simply through\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   my_string := my_date\n</syntaxhighlight>\nas a shortcut for using an explicit object creation with a conversion procedure:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   create my_string.make_from_date (my_date)\n</syntaxhighlight>\nTo make the first form possible as a synonym for the second, it suffices to list the creation procedure (constructor) <code>make_from_date</code> in a <code>convert</code> clause at the beginning of the class.\n\nAs another example, if there is such a conversion procedure listed from <code>TUPLE [day: INTEGER; month: STRING; year: INTEGER]</code>, then one can directly assign a tuple to a date, causing the appropriate conversion, as in\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n      Bastille_day := [14, \"July\", 1789]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Exception handling===\n[[Exception handling]] in Eiffel is based on the principles of design by contract. For example, an exception occurs when a routine's caller fails to satisfy a precondition, or when a routine cannot ensure a promised postcondition. In Eiffel, exception handling is not used for [[control flow]] or to correct data-input mistakes.\n\nAn Eiffel exception handler is defined using the <tt>rescue</tt> keyword. Within the <tt>rescue</tt> section, the <tt>retry</tt> keyword executes the routine again. For example, the following routine tracks the number of attempts at executing the routine, and only retries a certain number of times:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nconnect_to_server (server: SOCKET)\n      -- Connect to a server or give up after 10 attempts.\n    require\n        server /= Void and then server.address /= Void\n    local\n        attempts: INTEGER\n    do\n        server.connect\n    ensure\n      connected: server.is_connected\n    rescue\n        if attempts < 10 then\n            attempts := attempts + 1\n            retry\n        end\n    end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis example is arguably flawed for anything but the simplest programs, however, because connection failure is to be expected. For most programs a routine name like <tt>attempt_connecting_to_server</tt> would be better, and the postcondition would not promise a connection, leaving it up to the caller to take appropriate steps if the connection was not opened.\n\n===Concurrency===\nA number of networking and threading libraries are available, such as EiffelNet and EiffelThreads. A concurrency model for Eiffel, based on the concepts of design by contract, is [[SCOOP (software)|SCOOP]], or ''Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming'', not yet part of the official language definition but available in [[EiffelStudio]].\nCAMEO<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brooke|first=Phillip|author2=Richard Paige|title=Cameo: An Alternative Model of Concurrency for Eiffel|journal=Formal Aspects of Computing|publisher=Springer|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s00165-008-0096-1|volume=21|issue=4|pages=363\u2013391}}</ref> is an (unimplemented) variation of SCOOP for Eiffel.\nConcurrency also interacts with exceptions. Asynchronous exceptions can be troublesome (where a routine raises an exception after its caller has itself finished).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brooke|first=Phillip|author2=Richard Paige|title=Exceptions in Concurrent Eiffel|journal=Journal of Object Technology|volume=6|issue=10|year=2007|url=http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2007_11/article4/|pages=111\u2013126|doi=10.5381/jot.2007.6.10.a4}}</ref>\n\n===Operator and bracket syntax, assigner commands===\nEiffel's view of computation is completely object-oriented in the sense that every operation is relative to an object, the \"target\". So for example an addition such as\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\na + b\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nis conceptually understood as if it were the method call\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\na.plus (b)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nwith target <code>a</code>, feature <code>plus</code> and argument <code>b</code>.\n\nOf course, the former is the conventional syntax and usually preferred. Operator syntax makes it possible to use either form by declaring the feature (for example in <code>INTEGER</code>, but this applies to other basic classes and can be used in any other for which such an operator is appropriate):\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nplus alias \"+\" (other: INTEGER): INTEGER\n        -- ... Normal function declaration...\n    end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe range of operators that can be used as \"alias\" is quite broad; they include predefined operators such as \"+\" but also \"free operators\" made of non-alphanumeric symbols. This makes it possible to design special infix and prefix notations, for example in mathematics and physics applications.\n\nEvery class may in addition have ''one'' function aliased to \"[]\", the \"bracket\" operator, allowing the notation <code>a [i, ...]</code> as a synonym for <code>a.f (i, ...)</code> where <code>f</code> is the chosen function. This is particularly useful for container structures such as arrays, hash tables, lists etc. For example, access to an element of a hash table with string keys can be written\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   number := phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n\"Assigner commands\" are a companion mechanism designed in the same spirit of allowing well-established, convenient notation reinterpreted in the framework of object-oriented programming. Assigner commands allow assignment-like syntax to call \"setter\" procedures. An assignment proper can never be of the form <code>a.x := v</code> as this violates information hiding; you have to go for a setter command (procedure). For example, the hash table class can have the function and the procedure\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nitem alias \"[]\" (key: STRING): ELEMENT         [3]\n      -- The element of key `key'.\n      -- (\"Getter\" query)\n    do\n        ...\n    end\n\nput (e: ELEMENT; key: STRING)\n      -- Insert the element `e', associating it with the key `key'.\n      -- (\"Setter\" command)\n    do\n        ...\n    end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThen to insert an element you have to use an explicit call to the setter command:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   [4] phone_book.put (New_person, \"JILL SMITH\")\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt is possible to write this equivalently as\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   [5] phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"] := New_person\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n(in the same way that <code>phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"]</code> is a synonym for <code>number := phone_book.item (\"JILL SMITH\")</code>), provided the declaration of <code>item</code> now starts (replacement for [3]) with\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\n   item alias \"[]\" (key: STRING): ELEMENT assign put\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis declares <code>put</code> as the assigner command associated with <code>item</code> and, combined with the bracket alias, makes [5] legal and equivalent to [4]. (It could also be written, without taking advantage of the bracket, as <code>phone_book.item (\"JILL SMITH\") := New_person</code>.\n\nnote: The argument list of a's assigner is constrained to be: (a's return type;all of a's argument list...)\n\n===Lexical and syntax properties===\nEiffel is not case-sensitive. The tokens <code>make</code>, <code>maKe</code> and <code>MAKE</code> all denote the same identifier. See, however, the \"style rules\" below.\n\nComments are introduced by <code>--</code> (two consecutive dashes) and extend to the end of the line.\n\nThe semicolon, as instruction separator, is optional. Most of the time the semicolon is just omitted, except to separate multiple instructions on a line. This results in less clutter on the program page.\n\nThere is no nesting of feature and class declarations. As a result, the structure of an Eiffel class is simple: some class-level clauses (inheritance, invariant) and a succession of feature declarations, all at the same level.\n\nIt is customary to group features into separate \"feature clauses\" for more readability, with a standard set of basic feature tags appearing in a standard order, for example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"eiffel\">\nclass HASH_TABLE [ELEMENT, KEY -> HASHABLE] inherit TABLE [ELEMENT]\n\n    feature -- Initialization\n         -- ... Declarations of initialization commands (creation procedures/constructors) ...\n\n    feature -- Access\n         -- ... Declarations of non-boolean queries on the object state, e.g. item ...\n\n    feature -- Status report\n         -- ... Declarations of boolean queries on the object state, e.g. is_empty ...\n\n    feature -- Element change\n         -- ... Declarations of commands that change the structure, e.g. put ...\n\n    -- etc.\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn contrast to most [[curly bracket programming language]]s, Eiffel makes a clear distinction between expressions and instructions. This is in line with the [[Command-Query Separation]] principle of the Eiffel method.\n\n===Style conventions===\nMuch of the documentation of Eiffel uses distinctive style conventions, designed to enforce a consistent look-and-feel. Some of these conventions apply to the code format itself, and others to the standard typographic rendering of Eiffel code in formats and publications where these conventions are possible.\n\nWhile the language is case-insensitive, the style standards prescribe the use of all-capitals for class names (<code>LIST</code>), all-lower-case for feature names (<code>make</code>), and initial capitals for constants (<code>Avogadro</code>). The recommended style also suggests underscore to separate components of a multi-word identifier, as in <code>average_temperature</code>.\n\nThe specification of Eiffel includes guidelines for displaying software texts in typeset formats: keywords in bold, user-defined identifiers and constants are shown in ''<code>italics</code>'', comments, operators, and punctuation marks in <code>Roman</code>, with program text in <code>blue</code> as in the present article to distinguish it from explanatory text. For example, the \"Hello, world!\" program given above would be rendered as below in Eiffel documentation:\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''class'''\n     ''HELLO_WORLD''\n '''create'''\n     ''make''\n '''feature'''\n    ''make''\n       '''do'''\n          ''print'' (\"Hello, world!\")\n       '''end'''\n '''end'''</span>\n\n===Interfaces to other tools and languages===\nEiffel is a purely object-oriented language but provides an [[open architecture]] for interfacing with \"external\" software in any other programming language.\n\nIt is possible for example to program machine- and operating-system level operations in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Eiffel provides a straightforward interface to C routines, including support for \"inline C\" (writing the body of an Eiffel routine in C, typically for short machine-level operations).\n\nAlthough there is no direct connection between Eiffel and C, many Eiffel [[compiler]]s ([[Visual Eiffel]] is one exception) output C [[source code]] as an [[intermediate language]], to submit to a C compiler, for [[Optimization (computer science)|optimizing]] and [[Porting|portability]]. As such, they are examples of [[transcompiler]]s. The Eiffel Compiler tecomp can execute Eiffel code directly (like an interpreter) without going via an intermediate C code or emit C code which will be passed to a C compiler in order to obtain optimized native code. On .NET, the [[EiffelStudio]] compiler directly generates [[Common Intermediate Language|CIL]] (Common Intermediate Language) code. The [[SmartEiffel]] compiler can also output [[Java bytecode]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/online/eiffel/basic.html Basic Eiffel Language Mechanisms], [http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/ Bertrand Meyer], August 2006.\n* [http://dev.eiffel.com Eiffel Software's Open Source initiative]\n* [https://www.eiffel.org/ Eiffel Community]\n* [http://www.eiffel.com/ Eiffel Software] web site of the company that introduced Eiffel, was Interactive Software Engineering (ISE).\n* Eiffel tutorial (100 pages) by [[Bertrand Meyer]] ([http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/online/eiffel50/intro/language/tutorial-00.html HTML])\n* [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm Eiffel standard], revision 2 (2006); this is the ECMA standard, with free access, its text identical to that of the ISO standard.\n* [http://www.liberty-eiffel.org/ LibertyEiffel] (based on the [[SmartEiffel]] codebase, released under the GNU GPL license), translates Eiffel code to [[C (programming language)|C]], is not completely standard compliant, with special emphasis on performance.\n* [http://smarteiffel.loria.fr/ SmartEiffel] (formerly SmallEiffel, with no new releases or development since 2007), a complete Eiffel compiler released under the GNU GPL license, translates Eiffel code either to [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Java bytecode]], is not standard compliant, with emphasis on performance.\n* [http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tecomp \"The Eiffel Compiler\" (tecomp)] an [[open source]] Eiffel compiler with [http://tecomp.sourceforge.net documentation].\n* [http://visual-eiffel.org Visual Eiffel] an [[open source]] implementation of Eiffel creating [[native code]] for X86 systems (Windows, Linux)\n* [http://www.eiffel-nice.org/ NICE] Nonprofit International Consortium for Eiffel.\n* [http://www.eiffel.org/ eiffel.org] Community around standard Eiffel.\n* [http://eiffelzone.com/ eiffelzone.com] Includes a comprehensive Eiffel Software Directory\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040604193933/http://cetus-links.org/oo_eiffel.html Cetus Eiffel Page]\n* [https://www.eiffel.org/doc/solutions/.NET Eiffel for .NET]\n* [http://archive.eiffel.com/nice/language/ <cite>Eiffel: the Language</cite>] subset\n* [http://www.artima.com/intv/abcs.html <cite>Multiple Inheritance and Interfaces: A Conversation with Scott Meyers</cite>]\n\n{{Ecma International Standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eiffel (Programming Language)}}\n[[Category:Object-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:Class-based programming languages]]\n[[Category:Object-oriented programming]]\n[[Category:Formal specification languages]]\n[[Category:High Integrity Programming Language]]\n[[Category:Programming languages created in 1986]]", "sha1": "o2t5zufan5bcfu0t3e7467vkqyapueq"}}, {"title": "Ezra", "ns": "0", "id": "9839", "revision": {"id": "866011329", "parentid": "866011054", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T17:51:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Thegreatluigi", "id": "25291008"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/MustacheMan48|MustacheMan48]] ([[User talk:MustacheMan48|talk]]) to last version by Zenadix", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'', one of [[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']]]]\n\n'''Ezra''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|z|r|\u0259}}; {{lang-he-n|\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d0}}, ''{{transl|he|\u2018Ezr\u0101}}'';<ref>\"[God] helps\" \u2013 [[Emil G.

Ezra led a large body of exiles back to Jerusalem, where he discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. Some years later Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah (a Jewish noble in his personal service) to Jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed Nehemiah had Ezra read the Law of Moses (the [[Torah]]) to the assembled Israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.\n\n==In later Second Temple period literature==\n\n===1 Esdras===\n[[1 Esdras]], probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order.

In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an [[angel]] of God three times and has four visions.

When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.\"<ref>1 Kings 17:13, 14, ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true.

Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\"<ref>1 Kings 17:18, ''New Revised Standard Version''.</ref> Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God \"listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\"<ref>''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This non-Israelite widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, \"...the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"<ref>1 Kings 17:24, ''New Revised Standard Version.''</ref> She made a confession that the Israelites had failed to make.\n\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets [[Obadiah (1 Kings)|Obadiah]], the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets when Ahab and Jezebel had been killing them. Elijah sends Obadiah back to Ahab to announce his return to Israel.\n\n==== Challenge to Baal ====\n[[File:JPF-Cave Of Elijah.JPG|thumb|A statue of Elijah in the Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel]]\n[[File:Elijahwindow.jpg|thumb|Elijah's offering is consumed by fire from heaven in a stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]\n\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he refers to him as the \"troubler of Israel.\" Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at Ahab, saying that it is Ahab who has troubled Israel by allowing the worship of [[false god]]s. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:21|NRSV}}</ref> And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, \"go limping\" or \"waver\", is the same as that used for \"danced\" in 1 Kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of Israel.\n\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of [[Asherah]] are summoned to [[Mount Carmel]]. Two altars are built, one for Baal and one for God. Wood is laid on the altars. Two oxen are slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:27|NRSV}}</ref> They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.\n\nElijah now orders that the altar of God be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:33\u201334|NIV}}</ref> He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the water, the sacrifice and the stones of the altar itself as well. Elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\n\n==== Mount Horeb ====\n[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201313|HE}}</ref> Later Elijah would prophesize about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to [[Beersheba]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the [[angel of the Lord]] touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.\n\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Moses]] had received the [[Ten Commandments]]. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a [[Cave of Elijah|cave]]. God again speaks to Elijah:<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}</ref> \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\". Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the \"only one left\". Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and \"stand before the Lord.\" A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a \"still small voice\" comes to Elijah and asks again, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. God then sends him out again, this time to [[Damascus]] to anoint [[Hazael]] as king of [[Aram-Damascus|Aram]], [[Jehu]] as king of [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] as his replacement.\n\n[[File:Elijah's cave P3160005.JPG|thumb|left|The Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel]]\n\n==== Vineyard of Naboth ====\nElijah encounters Ahab again in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21|HE}}, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of [[Naboth]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\n\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you killed, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\"<ref>1 Kings 21:19, ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]].\n\n==== Ahaziah ====\n[[File:094.Elijah Destroys the Messengers of Ahaziah.jpg|thumb|Elijah destroying the messengers of Ahaziah (illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]]. The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of [[Beelzebub|Baalzebub]] in [[Ekron]], outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:6|NRSV}}</ref> Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\n\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:17|NRSV}}</ref>\n\n==== Departure ====\n[[File:Elijah Departure and Elisha.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elijah Departure and Elisha, Russian Orthodox icon of 17th century]]\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3\u20139|HE}}, [[Elisha]] (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\n\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his [[mantle (vesture)|mantle]] and strikes the water.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}</ref> The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\n\n=== Final mention: 2nd Chronicles ===\nElijah is mentioned once more in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|21:12|HE}}, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to [[Jehoram of Judah]]. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of [[YHVH]] the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind. Michael Wilcock, formerly of [[Trinity College, Bristol]], suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet.<ref>Myers, J. M. ''The Anchor Bible: II Chronicles.'' Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, 1965. pp. 121\u201323.</ref> [[John Van Seters]], however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition.<ref>VanSeters, John. \"Elijah.\" In Jones, Lindsay. Editor in Chief. ''Encyclopedia of Religion.'' Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2005. p. 2764.</ref> However, Wilcock argues that Elijah's letter, 'does address a very 'northern' situation in the southern kingdom', and thus is authentic.<ref>IVP New Bible Commentary 21st Century Edition, p. 410.</ref>\n\n=== The Christian end of Elijah in Malachi ===\n[[File:SaintIliaFromRilaMonastery.jpg|thumb|Saint Elias in the cave (below) and on a chariot of fire.

Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: \"and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|ESV}}</ref> Finally, the verses in Malachi are believed to indicate that Elijah has a role in the end-times, immediately before the second coming of Jesus.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== One theory of textual analysis ===\nAccording to Susanne Otto, the Elijah stories were added to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] in four stages. The first stage dates from the final edition of the History, about 560 BC, when the three stories of [[Naboth]]'s vineyard, the death of [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], and the story of [[Jehu]]'s coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of God's word and the cycle of Baal worship and religious reform in the history of the Northern Kingdom. The narratives about the [[Omri]]de wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards God determines the fate of Israel. According to Otto, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17\u201318|HE}} was added in early post-Exilic times (after 538 BC) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with God after the time of judgment. Additionally, Otto suggests that in the fifth century BC, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201318|HE}} and the remaining [[Elisha]] stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of Israel. The foregoing Otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars.<ref name=otto>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Susanne |url=http://jot.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/487 |title=Susanne Otto, \"The Composition of the Elijah-Elisha Stories and the Deuteronomistic History\"|journal=Journal for the Study of the Old Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508 |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}(Online Abstract)</ref>\n\n== In the Aggadah, Talmud, and Extra-canonical Books ==\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the [[aggadah]], which is found throughout various collections of [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death{{snd}} or \"translation\"{{snd}} ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\n\nFrom the time of [[Malachi]], who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\" (Mal. 3:23), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\n\n=== Origin ===\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,<ref>Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi.</ref>\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in I Chronicles 8:27, and\n(3) he was a priest.\n\nMany Christian Church fathers also<ref>Aphraates, \"Homilies,\" ed. Wright, p.&nbsp;314; Epiphanius, \"H\u00e6res.\" lv. 3, passim</ref> have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some Rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with [[Phinehas]].<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xlvii.; Targ. Yer. on Num. xxv. 12</ref>\n\nAccording to later [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature,<ref>Yal\u1e33u\u1e6d Reubeni, Bereshit, 9a, ed. Amsterdam</ref> Elijah was really an [[angel]] in human form, so that he had neither parents nor offspring.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} See [[Melchizedek]].\n\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\n\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"<ref>Baba Metzia 14B</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's zeal for God ===\n[[File:Statue of Saint Elijah at Saint Elijah Maronite Cathedral, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of Elijah at the [[Saint Elias Cathedral]], [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nIn spite of Elijah's many miracles, the mass of the Jewish people remained as godless as before. A [[midrash]] tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxix.</ref>\n\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.<ref>Tanna debe Eliyahu Zu\u1e6da viii.</ref>\n\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds.\" This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since it disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.<ref>Tan., Pe\u1e33ude, p.&nbsp;128, Vienna ed.</ref>\n\nThree years after this vision<ref>Seder 'Olam R. xvii.</ref> Elijah was \"translated.\" Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men,<ref>\u1e32id. 70; Ber. R. xxxiv. 8</ref> a task which according to the apocalyptic literature is entrusted to Enoch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBut as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper.<ref>Suk. 5a</ref> In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah,<ref>Compare Pir\u1e33e R. El. xvi.</ref> but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.\n\n=== Ecclesiasticus ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"At the appointed time, it is written, you are destined<br />\nto calm the wrath of God before it breaks out in fury,<br />\nto turn the hearts of parents to their children,<br />\nand to restore the tribes of Jacob.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2014 A line in [[Ecclesiasticus]] describing Elijah's mission (Ecclesiasticus 48:10).\n|}\nIn the [[Ben Sira|Wisdom of Jesus ben Sira]] ({{Bibleverse||Sirach|48:10|NRSV}}) his tasks are altered to: 1) herald the eschaton, 2) calm God's fury, 3) restore familial peace, and 4) restore the 12 tribes.\n\n== Elijah in Judaism ==\n\n=== Elijah's chair ===\n{{See also|Brit milah}}\n[[File:Chair of Elijah.JPG|thumb|\"Chair of Elijah\" used during the [[brit milah]] (circumcision) ceremony. The [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] inscription reads \"This is the chair of Elijah, remembered for Good.\"]]\n\nAt Jewish [[Brit milah|circumcision]] ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a [[witness]] at all circumcisions when the sign of the [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19|HE}}): Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on [[Mount Carmel]]. ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18|HE}}) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\" ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:10|HE}}). According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:18|HE}}), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.<ref>\"Elijah, Chair of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref><ref>Unterman, Alan. \"Elijah's Chair.\" ''Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1991.</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's cup ===\n{{See also|Passover Seder}}\nIn the [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]], Elijah would visit [[rabbis]] to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the [[Jewish Eschatology|eschaton]]. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes.\"<ref>\"Elijah, Cup of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref>\n\nOne such decision was whether the [[Passover Seder]] required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the [[Book of Exodus]]:\n\n<blockquote>I am the Lord, and ''I will bring you out'' from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and ''I will deliver you'' from their bondage, and ''I will redeem you'' with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and ''I will take you'' for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}).</blockquote>\n\nThe next verse, \"And ''I will bring you'' into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:8|HE}}) was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\n\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.<ref name=\" Temple\">Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish Literacy.''

As part of the concluding [[hymn]], an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\n== Elijah in Jewish folklore ==\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 580.</ref> ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:25|HE}}). Because of Phinehas' zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, \"a covenant of lasting priesthood\" ({{Bibleverse||Numbers|25:13|HE}}). Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel [[Sandalphon]],<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Jewish Philadelphia: Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 589</ref> whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. pp. 590\u201391.</ref> Yet another name for Elijah is \"Angel of the Covenant\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 201.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ===\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood)<ref>Bialik, H. N. and Y. H Ravnitzky. eds. ''The Book of Legends: Sefer Ha-Aggadah.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1992. pp. 756, 782, 805.</ref> to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\n\nOne such story is that of Rabbi [[Joshua ben Levi]]. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.\n\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 599.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Eliezer ===\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai|Simon ben Yohai]] is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 597.</ref>\n\n=== Lilith ===\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of [[Lilith]]. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956.</ref>\n\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.\n\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 224\u201325.</ref>\n\n== Elijah in Christianity ==\n\n=== References in the New Testament ===\n[[File:Intesa elijah.jpg|thumb|A Northern Russian icon from ca. 1290 showing the ascent of Elijah toward heaven]]\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] would say for those who believed, [[John the Baptist]] was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by [[Malachi]].\n\nSome English translations of the New Testament use [[Elias]], a Latin form of the name. In the [[King James Version]], \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\n\n==== John the Baptist ====\n[[John the Baptist]] preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|3:4|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:6|9}}). He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\n\nIn the [[Gospel of John]], when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\" ({{Bibleverse||John|1:21|9}}). {{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:10\u201313|9}} however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]] in Luke, [[Gabriel]] appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah\" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|9}}).\n\n==== Jesus Christ ====\n[[File:Transfigurationbloch.jpg|thumb|right|Elijah appeared at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].]]\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Herod Antipas]] hears some of the stories surrounding [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son.\" The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.<!-- I know that there has been a tabernacle built, I just need to find a source. -->\n\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus (John 4:19) \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" and Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced [[Son of God]].<ref>Albright, W.

In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first [[hermit]]s of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life.<ref>Ackerman, Jane. \"Stories of Elijah and medieval Carmelite identity.\" ''History of Religions.'' 35(2). 1995. 124\u201347.</ref><ref>Ackerman, Jane.

In writing of St. [[Albert Avogadro|Albert]], Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist [[Daniel Papebroch]] stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly.  From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of [[Jean de Launoy]] and the [[Sorbonne]]. In November 1698, [[Pope Innocent XII]] ordered an end to the controversy.<ref>[http://carmelitenuns.com/Controversies_Oother_Orders.htm  \"Controversies with Other Orders\", The Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\"]</ref>\n\n==== Liturgical commemorations ====\n[[Image:Prophet-Elias-Grk-ikon.png|thumb|Elias on [[Mount Horeb]]. [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]].]]\n\nSince most [[Eastern Churches]] either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, ''Elias'' (or its modern [[iotacism|iotacized]] form ''Ilias'') is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]].\n\nThe [[feast day]] of [[saint]] Elias falls on July 20 of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|Orthodox liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 20 currently falls on August 2 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\n\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nThe [[Apolytikion]] in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>The incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Kontakion]] in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>O Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.</blockquote>\n\n==== {{anchor|Helios}}Pagan associations and mountaintops ====\n\n{{See also|Peryn#The cult of Peroun in Peryn and in Novgorod}}\n\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with [[Helios]], the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:11|9}}) just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust sacrifice]] offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}) corresponds to the sun warming the earth.<ref>J.

Since Wachsmuth (1864),<ref>C. Wachsmuth, ''Das alte Griechenland im neuen'', 1864, p. 23, cited by Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'', 1907, p. 174</ref> the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias.<ref>Delehaye, p. 174</ref> The modern folklore is not good evidence for the ''origin'' of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops.<ref name=\"cook\"/> Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".<ref>F.

When Elias prevailed over the priests of [[Baal]], it was on [[Mount Carmel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}), which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on [[Mount Horeb]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:8|9}}). When Elias confronted [[Ahab]], he stopped the rains for three years ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|17:1-18:1|9}}).<ref name=\"cook\">[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', 1925, p. 178 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9iShet_ZtHAC&pg=PA178 Google Books]</ref>\n\nA map of mountain-cults of Zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to Elias, including [[Mount Olympus]], [[Mount Lykaion]], [[Mount Arachnaion]], and [[Mount Taleton]] on the mainland, and [[Mount Kenaion]], [[Mount Oche]], and [[Mount Kynados]] in the islands. Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.<ref name=\"cook\" />\n\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\n\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to [[Ljuboten]] on the Sharr mountains.

Elijah lived in the reign of Ahab (896\u2013874 BC) and Ahaziah (874\u2013872 BC), kings of the (northern) kingdom of Israel or Samaria. He was a prophet of the desert, like John the Baptist, unlike our holy Prophet, who took part in, controlled, and guided all the affairs of his people. Both Ahab and Azariah were prone to lapse into the worship of Baal, the sun-god worshipped in Syria. That worship also included the worship of nature-powers and procreative powers, as in the Hindu worship of the Lingam, and led to many abuses. King Ahab had married a princess of Sidon, Jezebel, a wicked woman who led her husband to forsake Allah and adopt Baal-worship.\"Elijah denounced all Ahab's sins as well as the sins of Ahaziah and had to flee for his life. Eventually, according to the Old Testament (4 Kings, 2:11) he was taken up in a whirlwind to heaven in a chariot of fire after he had left his mantle with Elisha the prophet.\"</ref> He is seen by [[Muslim]]s to be the prophetic predecessor to [[Elisha]]. While neither the Bible nor the Qur'an mentions the genealogy of Elijah, some scholars of Islam believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet [[Aaron#Islam|Aaron]].<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, p. 474</ref> Elijah is rarely associated with [[Islamic eschatology]] and [[Islam]] views [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]].<ref>''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C.

Asad, Commentary on 19: 56\u201357</ref> and Khidr.<ref>''Dimensions of Islam'', F. Schuon, index. ''Sayyidna Khizr''</ref> [[Islamic]] [[legend]] later developed the figure of Elijah, greatly embellishing upon his attributes, and some apocryphal literature gave Elijah the status of a half-human, half-angel.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. III, H-Iram</ref> Elijah also appears in later works of literature, including the ''[[Hamzanama]]''.<ref>''Adventures of Amir Hamza'', J. Seyller, p. 240</ref>\n\n=== Quran ===\nElijah is mentioned in the [[Quran]], where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. The Quran narrates that Elijah told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of [[Baal]], the primary [[Idolatry|idol]] of the area. The Quran states, \"Verily Elijah was one of the apostles. When he said to his people: \"Will you not fear [[Allah|God]]? \"Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your {{LORD}} and Cherisher and the {{LORD}} and Cherisher of your fathers of old?\" [[As-Saaffat]] 123\u2013126<ref>{{Cite quran|37|123|e=126|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran makes it clear that the majority of Elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. However, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of [[God]] among them followed Elijah and believed in and worshiped God. The Quran states, \"They denied him (Elijah), and will surely be brought to punishment, Except the sincere and devoted Servants of God (among them). And We left his (memory) for posterity.\" [[As-Saaffat]] 127\u2013128<ref>{{Cite quran|37|127|e=128|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nIn the Quran, God praises Elijah in two places:\n* {{Quote|Peace be upon Elijah! This is how We reward those who do good. He is truly among our believing servants.|Quran, chapter 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah|verse]] 129\u2013132<ref>{{Cite quran|37|129|e=132|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n* {{Quote|And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elijah, they were all from among the righteous|Quran, chapter 6 ([[Al-An'am]]), verse 85<ref>{{Cite quran|6|85|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\nNumerous commentators, including [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], have offered commentary on VI: 85 saying that Elijah, [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] were all spiritually connected. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] says, \"The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: \"the Righteous.\" They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as \"Elias, which was for to come\" (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3).\"<ref>[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], ''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', Note. '''905'''\"</ref>\n\n=== Literature and tradition ===\nMuslim [[literature]] and [[tradition]] recounts that Elijah preached to the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], ruled over by [[Ahab]] and later his son [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]]. He is believed to have been a \"prophet of the desert\u2014like [[John the Baptist]]\".<ref>Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, Commentary'', ''Note on Elijah''</ref> Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife [[Jezebel]], who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of [[False god|false idols]] in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of [[God]] to Israel after him.<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, ''Stories of Elias and Elisha''</ref>\n\nElijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr, and in one legend, with [[Muhammad]] himself.<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Elijah'': \"Muslim exegetes report that the prophet Muhammad and a band of followers once met Elijah on a journey outside Mecca. Elijah served the prophet with food from heaven and then left on a cloud heading for the heavens\"</ref> In [[Islamic]] [[mysticism]], Elijah is associated closely with the sage [[Khidr]]. One hadith reported that Elijah and [[Khidr]] met together every year in [[Jerusalem]] to go on the [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Elijah'': \"It is reported by Ibn Kathir that every year during the month of [[Ramadan]] in [[Jerusalem]], the prophets Elijah and [[Khidr]] meet...\"</ref> Elijah appears also in the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of [[Khidr]] as well as one who drank from the [[Fountain of Youth]].<ref>''The Adventures of Amir Hamza'', trans. M. A. Farooqi, cf. List of Characters: ''Ilyas'' or ''Prophet Elias''</ref>\n\nFurther, It is narrated in [[Kitab al-Kafi]] that Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] was reciting the prostration of Ilyas (Elijah) in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars: \n<blockquote><poem>\n\"O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?\" To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, \"Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you\" <ref name=\"Kulayni\">{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad ibn Ya\u2019qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}</ref>.\n</blockquote></poem>\n\nAlthough most [[Muslim]] scholars believed that Elijah preached in [[Israel]], some early commentators on the [[Qur'an]] stated that Elijah was sent to [[Baalbek]], in [[Lebanon]].<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Elias and Elisha''</ref> Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of ''[[Baal]]'', which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping. Scholars who reject identification of Elijah's town with Baalbek further argue that the town of Baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of Elijah in either the Qur'an or the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam'', B.

The Hebrew text at {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17:4\u20136|HE}} uses the word {{lang|he|\u05e2\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd}} ''`\u014drv\u012bm'', which means ''ravens'', but with a different vocalization might equally mean ''Arabs''. The [[Septuagint]] has {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}}, ''ravens'', and other traditional translations followed.\n\nAlternatives have been proposed for many years; for example [[Adam Clarke]] (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing.<ref>[[Adam Clarke|Clarke, Adam]]. The Holy Bible ... with a Commentary and Critical Notes, Volume II, London 1836</ref> Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean (see {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13\u201317|HE}}) as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.\n\nProf. John Gray chooses ''Arabs'', saying \"We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman.\"<ref>Gray, John. Old Testament Library, I & II Kings, SCM Press, London, 1964</ref> His translation of the verses in question is: \n\n<blockquote>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there. And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah and went and dwelt in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan. And the Arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.</blockquote>\n\n=== Ascension into the heavens ===\nIn the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus says: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, ''[even]'' the Son of man which is in heaven.\" (John 3:13)\n\nTraditionally Christianity interprets the [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#Son of Man|\"Son of Man\"]] as a title of Jesus, but this has never been an article of faith and there are other interpretations. Further interpreting this quote, some Christians believe that Elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven<ref name=\"djytel\">{{cite web |last=Coram |first=James |url=http://www.concordant.org/expohtml/GeneralExpositions/EnochAndElijah.html |title=biblical studies: The Fate of Enoch and Elijah |publisher=Concordant Publishing Concern |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522142440/http://www.concordant.org/expohtml/GeneralExpositions/EnochAndElijah.html |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}</ref> or with [[Jehoram of Judah|King Jehoram of Judah]].<ref name = \"djytel\"/> The prophets reacted in such a way that makes sense if he was carried away, and not simply straight up ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:16|9}}).\n\nThe question of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21 after Elijah had ascended. Some have suggested that the letter was written before Elijah ascended, but only delivered later.<ref>Bromiley ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E\u2013J'' p. 55</ref> The rabbinical [[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]] explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension.<ref>Aryeh Kaplan ''The handbook of Jewish thought, Volume 1 1992 p. 116 \"This was seven years after Elijah's death; [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] 17.25\"</ref> This is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of [[Josephus]]' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' when dealing with this issue.<ref>Begg C. ''Josephus' story of the later monarchy: (AJ 9, 1\u201310, 185)'' Section \"Elijah's Letter\" p119</ref> Others have argued that Elijah was only \"caught away\" such as Philip in Acts 8:39<ref>Ron Abel ''Wrested Scriptures'' \"There is evidence that Elijah was back on earth after he was taken away in the whirlwind. It can be shown that a letter was received by Jehoram, King of Judah, from Elijah, after Elijah was taken to heaven. Either the letter was written before he went to heaven and delivered by a messenger on earth (unlikely), or Elijah was \"caught away\" as was Philip from the Gaza Road to Azotas, (about 17 miles, Acts 8:39, 40) for an unspecified purpose and returned to the earth. Consider the evidence: 1. Elijah had been taken to heaven in a whirlwind. (2 Kings 2:11). 2. Elisha had taken over the duties of Elijah in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Kings 3:10, 11)., 3. Jehoram received a letter from Elijah, the prophet. (2 Chron. 21:1, 9\u201312). King Jehoram reigned after Jehoshaphat.

For many Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:9\u201313|9}}). Commentators have said that Moses' appearance represented the law, while Elijah's appearance represented the prophets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastdays-eschatology.net/Elijah-the-prophet.html|title=Elijah the prophet|website=lastdays-eschatology.net}}</ref> \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that Elijah returned on April 3, 1836 in an appearance to [[Joseph Smith]] and Oliver Cowdery, fulfilling the prophecy in Malachi.\n\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] believes Elijah returned as the [[biblical]] [[prophet]] [[John the Baptist]] and as the [[B\u00e1b]] who founded the [[B\u00e1b\u00ed]] Faith in 1844.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-5.html#pg57 |title=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Reference Library \u2013 God Passes By |pages= 49\u201360 |publisher=Reference.bahai.org |date=2010-12-31 | access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/bne-18.html |title=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Reference Library \u2013 Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and the New Era |pages= 15\u201316 |publisher=Reference.bahai.org |date=2010-12-31 | access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nation of Islam]] believes Elijah returned as [[Elijah Muhammad]], [[black separatist]] religious leader (who claimed to be a \"messenger\", not a prophet). This is considered less important than their belief that Allah himself showed up in the person of [[Fard Muhammad]], the founder of the group.

The oratorio chronicles many episodes of Elijah's life, including his challenge to Ahab and the contest of the gods, the miracle of raising the dead, and his ascension into heaven. Composed and premiered in 1846, the oratorio was criticized by members of the [[New German School]] but nonetheless remains one of the most popular Romantic choral-orchestral works in the repertoire.\n* In his ethnography ''[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape]'', anthropologist [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107] discusses the [[syncretic]] harvest feast of Elijah's Day (''Ilindan/Ali\u0111un''), shared by [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] throughout [[Bosnia]].<ref>Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107, S.

Starting with a well-known Bosnian proverb about Elijah's two names \"Ilija until noon - Alija after noon\" (''Do podne Ilija, od podne Alija''), Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discusses the traditional and postwar waiting for Elijah, as well as the plethora of other characters he merges with (e.g. Slavic deity [[Perun]] and prophet [[Khidr]]). As the central trope in the book, the waiting for Elijah becomes the waiting for the restoration of home and cosmology after nationalist violence. The absence of Elijah is reminiscent of the one in Jewish rituals and Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discovers an imaginative form of political resistance in the waiting for Elijah's return. \n* In ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', the English knight [[Astolfo]] flies up to the moon in Elijah's flaming chariot.\n* [[Elijah Rock]] is a traditional [[Christian]] [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] about Elijah, also sometimes used by Jewish youth groups.\n* \"Go Like Elijah\" is a song by the American rock-pop-jazz songwriter [[Chi Coltrane]].\n* [[Lorenzetto]] created a statue of Elijah with assistance of the young sculptor [[Raffaello da Montelupo]], using designs by Raphael.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |title=Link to on-line biography of Lorenzetto from Vasari's '&#39;Vite'&#39; |publisher=Efn.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Fifth Mountain]]'' by [[Paulo Coelho]] is based on the story of Elijah.\n* Christian metal band [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]] released the song \"God of Elijah\" on their 2001 album [[By God]].

Individuals with expressive aphasia may only produce single words, or words in groups of two or three.<ref name=\":1\" /> Long pauses between words are common and multi-syllabic words may be produced one syllable at a time with pauses between each syllable.<ref name=\":1\" /> The prosody of a person with Broca's aphasia is compromised by shortened length of utterances and the presence of self-repairs and disfluencies.<ref name=\":3\">Manasco, H.

Agrammatism, or the lack of grammatical morphemes in sentence production, has also been observed in lifelong users of American Sign Language who have left hemisphere damage. The lack of syntactic accuracy shows that the errors in signing are not due to damage to the motor cortex, but rather are a manifestation of the damage to the language-producing area of the brain.

This agrammatism overlaps with receptive aphasia, but can be seen in patients who have expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia.

A stroke is caused by hypoperfusion (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by [[thrombosis]] or [[embolism]]. Some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients.<ref name='Bakheit'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0269215507078452|title=The rate and extent of improvement with therapy from the different types of aphasia in the first year of stroke|first4=S|last4=Griffiths|first3=S|last3=Carrington|journal=Integumentary Rehabilitation|first2=S|year=2007|last2=Shaw|first=AMO|last=Bakheit|pmid=17981853|volume=21|issue=10|pages=941\u2013949|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> Expressive aphasia occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke.<ref name='Pedersen'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1159/000073896|title=Aphasia after stroke: Type, severity, and prognosis - The Copenhagen aphasia study|first3=TS|last3=Olsen|journal=Cerebrovascular diseases|first2=K|year=2004|last2=Vinter|first=PM|last=Pedersen|pmid=14530636|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35\u201343|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nIn most cases, expressive aphasia is caused by a stroke in Broca's area or the surrounding vicinity.

In the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. If this were true, damage to the homologous region of Broca's area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. More recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. However, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\nExpressive aphasia is classified as non-fluent aphasia, as opposed to fluent aphasia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/|title=Common Classifications of Aphasia|website=www.asha.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref> Diagnosis is done on a case by case basis, as [[lesions]] often affect the surrounding [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and deficits are highly variable among patients with aphasia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-faqs/|title=Aphasia FAQ's|last=|first=|date=November 7, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA physician is typically the first person to recognize aphasia in a patient who is being treated for damage to the brain. Routine processes for determining the presence and location of lesion in the brain include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans.

Most aphasia treatment is individualized based on a patient's condition and needs as assessed by a speech language pathologist. Patients go through a period of spontaneous recovery following brain injury in which they regain a great deal of language function.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nIn the months following injury or stroke, most patients receive traditional treatment for a few hours per day. Among other exercises, patients practice the repetition of words and phrases.

MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as \"water\" and \"I love you\") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.<ref name='Schlaug' />\n\n[[FMRI]] studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere.<ref name=\"Schlaug\"/> The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as \"thank you\", \"how are you?\" or \"I am fine.\" This type of phrases falls into the category of [[formulaic language]] and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.<ref name='Stahl c'>{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Benjamin|last2=Kotz|first2=Sonja A.|title=Facing the music: Three issues in current research on singing and aphasia|journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1033 |year=2013 |pages=1\u20134 |issn=1664-1078 |doi= 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01033}}</ref>\n\nA pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain.

In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged (\"constrained\") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.<ref name='Pulvermuller' />\n\nTwo important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions.<ref name='Meinzer' /><ref name='Pulvermuller' />  These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain.<ref name='Pulvermuller2' /> Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.<ref name='Meinzer' />\n\nIt is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased [[neuroplasticity]]. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.\n\nThe strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a \"plateau\" period of recovery.<ref name='Meinzer' /><ref name='Pulvermuller' /> It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term. However, improvements only seem to be made while a patient is undergoing intense therapy.<ref name='Meinzer' /> Recent work has investigated combining constraint-induced aphasia therapy with drug treatment, which led to an amplification of therapy benefits.<ref name='Berthier'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ana.21597|title=Memantine and constraint-induced aphasia therapy in chronic poststroke aphasia|journal=Annals of Neurology|year=2009|first=Marcelo|last=Berthier|volume=65|issue=5|pages=577\u2013578|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=|pmid=19475666|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Medication===\nIn addition to active speech therapy, pharmaceuticals have also been considered as a useful treatment for expressive aphasia.

It has been seen that piracetam is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. When used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.{{sfn|Berthier|2005}}\n\nBromocriptine has been shown by some studies to increase verbal fluency and word retrieval with therapy than with just therapy alone.<ref name='de Boissezon' />  Furthermore, its use seems to be restricted to non-fluent aphasia.<ref name='Berthier' />\n\nDonepezil has shown a potential for helping chronic aphasia.<ref name='Berthier' />\n\nNo study has established irrefutable evidence that any drug is an effective treatment for aphasia therapy.<ref name='de Boissezon' /> Furthermore, no study has shown any drug to be specific for language recovery.<ref name='Berthier' />  Comparison between the recovery of language function and other motor function using any drug has shown that improvement is due to a global increase plasticity of neural networks.<ref name='de Boissezon' />\n\n===Transcranial magnetic stimulation===\nIn [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), magnetic fields are used to create electrical currents in specified [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions. The procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex.

For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. \"What\" and \"who\" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> For instance, therapists have used sentences like, \"Who is the boy helping?\" and \"What is the boy fixing?\" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training \"who\" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained \"who\" sentences as well as untrained \"what\" sentences, and vice versa.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Likewise, \"where\" and \"when\" question types are very closely linked. \"What\" and \"who\" questions alter placement of arguments, and \"where\" and \"when\" sentences move adjunct phrases.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Training is in the style of: \"The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?\"<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.<ref name=\"TUF\" />\n\nResults: Patients\u2019 use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.<ref name=\"TUF\" />\n\n===Mechanisms of recovery===\nMechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy.<ref name='Berthier' /> [[FMRI]] studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area.<ref name='Berthier' /> It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation.<ref name='Heiss'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1531-8249(199904)45:4<430::AID-ANA3>3.0.CO;2-P|title=Differential capacity of left and right hemispheric areas for compensation of poststroke|first5=H|last5=Karbe|first4=M|last4=Ghaemi|first3=A|last3=Thiel|first2=J |journal=Ann Neurol|last2=Kessler|year=1999|first=W-D|last=Heiss|volume=45|pmid=10211466|issue=4|pages=430\u2013438|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a \"dead-end\" and can lead only to partial recovery.<ref name='Martin' />\n\nIt has been proven that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy.

The majority of this improvement is seen in the first four weeks in therapy following a stroke and slows thereafter.<ref name='Bakheit' /> However, this timeline will vary depending upon the type of stroke experienced by the patient. Patients who experienced an ischemic stroke may recover in the days and weeks following the stroke, and then experience a plateau and gradual slowing of recovery. On the contrary, patients who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke experience a slower recovery in the first 4\u20138 weeks, followed by a faster recovery which eventually stabilizes.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last = Manasco|first = M.

By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\nThe discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist [[Carl Wernicke]], who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as [[Wernicke's area]]. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and [[receptive aphasia]]).<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Broca's region]]\n*[[Transcortical sensory aphasia]]\n*[[Wernicke's aphasia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*ASHA Glossary: Broca's Aphasia.

The mythical founder of the city was a prince of [[Athens]] named [[Androklos]], who had to leave his country after the death of his father, King Kodros. According to the legend, he founded Ephesus on the place where the oracle of [[Delphi]] became reality (\"A fish and a boar will show you the way\"). Androklos drove away most of the native [[Caria]]n and [[Leleges|Lelegian]] inhabitants of the city and united his people with the remainder. He was a successful warrior, and as a king he was able to join the twelve cities of [[Ionia]] together into the [[Ionian League]]. During his reign the city began to prosper. He died in a battle against the Carians when he came to the aid of [[Priene]], another city of the Ionian League.<ref name=\"Pausanias\">{{cite book | title=Description of Greece,| last=Pausanias| year=1965| pages=7.2.8\u20139| publisher=Loeb Classical Library| location=New York}}</ref> Androklos and his dog are depicted on the Hadrian temple frieze, dating from the 2nd century.

The many-breasted \"Lady of Ephesus\", identified with Artemis, was venerated in the [[Temple of Artemis]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]] and the largest building of the ancient world according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (4.31.8).

After the Cimmerians had been driven away, the city was ruled by a series of tyrants. Following a revolt by the people, Ephesus was ruled by a council.

Croesus made the populations of the different settlements around Ephesus regroup (''[[synoikismos]]'') in the vicinity of the Temple of Artemis, enlarging the city.\n\nLater in the same century, the Lydians under Croesus invaded Persia. The Ionians refused a peace offer from [[Cyrus the Great]], siding with the Lydians instead. After the Persians defeated Croesus, the Ionians offered to make peace, but Cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire.<ref>Herodotus i. 141</ref> They were defeated by the Persian army commander [[Harpagos]] in 547&nbsp;BC. The Persians then incorporated the Greek cities of Asia Minor into the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Those cities were then ruled by [[satrap]]s.\n\nEphesus has intrigued archaeologists because for the Archaic Period there is no definite location for the settlement. There are numerous sites to suggest the movement of a settlement between the Bronze Age and the Roman period, but the silting up of the natural harbours as well as the movement of the Kayster River meant that the location never remained the same.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[File:Statue of Artemis (5282695469).jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Artemis]] of Ephesus]]\nEphesus continued to prosper, but when taxes were raised under [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]] and [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius]], the Ephesians participated in the [[Ionian Revolt]] against Persian rule in the [[Battle of Ephesus (498&nbsp;BC)]], an event which instigated the [[Greco-Persian wars]]. In 479&nbsp;BC, the Ionians, together with [[Athens]], were able to oust the Persians from the shores of Asia Minor. In 478&nbsp;BC, the Ionian cities with Athens entered into the [[Delian League]] against the Persians. Ephesus did not contribute ships but gave financial support.\n\nDuring the [[Peloponnesian War]], Ephesus was first allied to Athens{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} but in a later phase, called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War, sided with Sparta, which also had received the support of the Persians. As a result, rule over the cities of Ionia was ceded again to Persia.\n\nThese wars did not greatly affect daily life in Ephesus. The Ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations:{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} they allowed strangers to integrate and education was valued. In later times, [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned having seen at Ephesus a representation of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] by Timarata, the daughter of a painter.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn 356&nbsp;BC the temple of Artemis was burnt down, according to legend, by a lunatic called [[Herostratus]]. The inhabitants of Ephesus at once set about restoring the temple and even planned a larger and grander one than the original.\n\n=== Hellenistic period ===\n\n[[File:Karte Ephesos MKL1888.png|thumb|left|Historical map of Ephesus, from ''[[Meyers Konversationslexikon]]'', 1888]]\n\nWhen [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persian forces at the [[Battle of Granicus]] in 334&nbsp;BC, the Greek cities of Asia Minor were liberated. The pro-Persian tyrant Syrpax and his family were stoned to death, and Alexander was greeted warmly when he entered Ephesus in triumph. When Alexander saw that the temple of Artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance it and have his name inscribed on the front. But the inhabitants of Ephesus demurred, claiming that it was not fitting for one god to build a temple to another. After Alexander's death in 323&nbsp;BC, Ephesus in 290&nbsp;BC came under the rule of one of Alexander's generals, [[Lysimachus]].\n\nAs the river [[Cayster]] (Grk. name \u039a\u03ac\u03cb\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) silted up the old harbour, the resulting marshes caused malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. Lysimachus forced the people to move from the ancient settlement around the temple of Artemis to the present site two kilometres ({{convert|2|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) away, when as a last resort the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers.<ref name=\"Strabo\">{{cite book | title=Geography (volume 1\u20137)| last=Strabo| date=1923\u20131932| pages=14.1.21| publisher=Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge}}</ref> The new settlement was officially called ''Arsinoea'' ({{lang-grc|\u1f08\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}<ref>Edwyn Robert Bevan, ''The House of Seleucus'', Vol. 1 (E.

After Lysimachus had destroyed the nearby cities of [[Lebedos]] and [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] in 292&nbsp;BC, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city.\n\nEphesus revolted after the treacherous death of [[Agathocles (son of Lysimachus)|Agathocles]], giving the Hellenistic king of Syria and Mesopotamia [[Seleucus I Nicator]] an opportunity for removing and killing Lysimachus, his last rival, at the [[Battle of Corupedium]] in 281&nbsp;BC. After the death of Lysimachus the town again was named Ephesus.\n\nThus Ephesus became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. After the murder of king [[Antiochus II Theos]] and his Egyptian wife, pharaoh [[Ptolemy III]] invaded the Seleucid Empire and the Egyptian fleet swept the coast of Asia Minor. Ephesus came under Egyptian rule between 263 and 197&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe Seleucid king [[Antiochus III the Great]] tried to regain the Greek cities of Asia Minor and recaptured Ephesus in 196&nbsp;BC but he then came into conflict with Rome. After a series of battles, he was defeated by [[Scipio Asiaticus]] at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190&nbsp;BC. As a result of the subsequent [[Treaty of Apamea]], Ephesus came under the rule of [[Eumenes II]], the Attalid king of [[Pergamon]], (ruled 197\u2013159&nbsp;BC). When his grandson [[Attalus III]] died in 133&nbsp;BC without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]], on condition that the city of Pergamon is kept free and autonomous.\n\n=== Roman period ===\n\n[[File:Ephesus Terrace Houses.jpg|left|thumb|The 'terrace houses' at Ephesus, showing how the wealthy lived during the Roman period.

Hence in 88&nbsp;BC Ephesus welcomed [[Archelaus (general)|Archelaus]], a general of [[Mithradates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], when he conquered Asia (the Roman name for western Asia Minor). From Ephesus, Mithridates ordered every Roman citizen in the province to be killed which led to the [[Asiatic Vespers]], the slaughter of 80,000 Roman citizens in Asia, or any person who spoke with a Latin accent. Many had lived in Ephesus, and statues and monument of Roman citizens in Ephesus were also destroyed. But when they saw how badly the people of [[Chios]] had been treated by Zenobius, a general of Mithridates, they refused entry to his army. Zenobius was invited into the city to visit [[Philopoemen]], the father of [[Monime]], the favourite wife of Mithridates, and the overseer of Ephesus. As the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. Mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. However, the Greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. Ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. When Mithridates was defeated in the [[First Mithridatic War]] by the Roman consul [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], Ephesus came back under Roman rule in 86&nbsp;BC. Sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.<ref name=\"Mithridatic War\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_mithridatic_10.html|title=History of Rome: The Mithridatic Wars \u00a7\u00a746\u201350|accessdate=2007-10-02|author=Appian of Alexandria (c.95&nbsp;AD-c.165&nbsp;AD)}}</ref>\n\nKing [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] of Egypt retired to Ephesus in 57 BC, passing his time in the sanctuary of the temple of Artemis when he failed to get restoration of his throne from the Roman senate.<ref>DioCass_39.16'3;</ref>\n\n[[Marcus Antonius|Mark Antony]] was welcomed by Ephesus for periods when he was proconsul<ref>Plutarch: Ant_23'1-24'12</ref> and in 33 BC with [[Cleopatra]] when he gathered his fleet of 800 ships before the [[battle of Actium]] with [[Octavius]].<ref>Plutarch: Ant_56'1-10</ref>\n\nWhen [[Augustus]] became emperor in 27&nbsp;BC, the most important change was when he made Ephesus the capital of [[Asia (Roman province)|proconsular Asia]] (which covered western Asia Minor) instead of Pergamum. Ephesus then entered an era of prosperity, becoming both the seat of the governor and a major centre of commerce. According to Strabo, it was second in importance and size only to Rome.<ref>Strabo . Geography (volume 1\u20137) 14.1.24. Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press</ref>\n\nThe city and temple were destroyed by the [[Goths]] in 263&nbsp;AD. This marked the decline of the city's splendour. However emperor [[Constantine the Great]] rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths.\n\n====The Roman population====\n\nUntil recently the population of Ephesus in Roman times was estimated to number up to 225,000 people.<ref name=pric18 /><ref name=hans253 /> More recent scholarship regards these estimates as unrealistic. Such a large estimate would require population densities only possible in modern times, or extensive settlement outside the city walls. This would have been impossible at Ephesus because of the mountain ranges, coastline and quarries which surrounded the city.<ref name=hans258 />\n[[File:Efes.ruins.jpg|thumb|left|Artist Simon Kozhin Ephesus. Ruins Temple of [[Hadrian]].]]\n\nThe wall of Lysimachus has been estimated to enclose an area of {{convert|415|ha}}. Not all of this area was inhabited due to public buildings and spaces in the centre and the steep slope of the B\u00fclb\u00fcl Da\u011f\u0131 mountain, which was enclosed by the wall. [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]] uses an estimate of {{convert|345|ha}} for the inhabited land. Using an average population density of 400 to 500 per hectare, he calculates that Ephesus would have had a population between 138,000 and 172,500, with a preference for the higher figure.<ref name=conn /> J. W. Hanson estimates the inhabited space to be smaller at {{convert|224|ha}}. He argues that population densities of 150 or 250 people per hectare are more realistic, which gives a range of 33,600 to 56,000 inhabitants.

The loss of its harbour caused Ephesus to lose its access to the [[Aegean Sea]], which was important for trade. People started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. The ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. Marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.\n\nSackings by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arabs]] first in the year 654\u2013655 by [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]], and later in 700 and 716 hastened the decline further.\n\nWhen the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] conquered Ephesus in 1090,<ref>Foss, Clive (1979) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Ephesus+after+antiquity:+a+late+antique,+Byzantine,+and+Turkish+city Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city]'', Cambridge University Press, p. 121.<br>G\u00f6koval\u0131, \u015eadan; Altan Erguvan (1982) ''Ephesus'', Ticaret Matbaac\u0131l\u0131k, p.7.</ref> it was a small village. The Byzantines resumed control in 1097 and changed the name of the town to Hagios Theologos. They kept control of the region until 1308. Crusaders passing through were surprised that there was only a small village, called Ayasalouk, where they had expected a bustling city with a large seaport. Even the temple of Artemis was completely forgotten by the local population. The Crusaders of the [[Second Crusade]] [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|fought]] the Seljuks just outside the town in December 1147.\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n[[File:\u0130sa Bey Camii.jpg|right|thumb|The [[\u0130sa Bey Mosque]] constructed in 1374\u201375, is one of the oldest and most impressive works of architectural art remaining from the [[Anatolian beyliks]].]]\n\nThe town surrendered, on 24 October 1304, to Sasa Bey, a Turkish warlord of the [[Mente\u015fe (beylik)|Mente\u015fo\u011fullar\u0131]] principality. Nevertheless, contrary to the terms of the surrender the Turks pillaged the church of Saint John and deported most of the local population to [[Thyrea, Greece]] when a revolt seemed probable.

Ayasoluk became an important harbour, from which the navy organised raids to the surrounding regions.\n\nThe town knew again a short period of prosperity during the 14th century under these new [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] rulers. They added important architectural works such as the [[\u0130sa Bey Mosque]], caravansaries and [[Turkish bath]]houses (hamam).\n\nEphesians were incorporated as vassals into the [[Ottoman Empire]] for the first time in 1390. The Central Asian warlord [[Tamerlane]] defeated the Ottomans in Anatolia in 1402, and the Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid I]] died in captivity. The region was restored to the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. After a period of unrest, the region was again incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1425.\n\nEphesus was completely abandoned by the 15th century.

From AD 52\u201354, the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] lived in Ephesus, working with the congregation and apparently organizing missionary activity into the hinterlands.<ref>\"Paul, St.\" Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005</ref> Initially, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Paul attended the [[Jewish synagogue]] in Ephesus, but after three months he became frustrated with the stubbornness or hardness of heart of some of the Jews, and moved his base to the school of [[Tyrannus (biblical figure)|Tyrannus]] ({{Bibleref|Acts|19:9}}). The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary reminds readers that the unbelief of \"some\" ({{lang-gr|\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2}}) implies that \"others, probably a large number, believed\"<ref>[[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary]] on [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/19.htm Acts 19] accessed 5 october 2015</ref> and therefore there must have been a community of [[Jewish Christian]]s in Ephesus. Paul introduced about twelve men to the '[[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]' who had previously only experienced the [[baptism]] of [[John the Baptist]] ({{Bibleref|Acts|19:1-7}}), and later became embroiled in a dispute with some artisans whose livelihood depended on selling statuettes of Artemis ({{lang-la|Diana|links=no}}) in the Temple of Artemis ({{Bibleref2|Acts|19:23-41|9|Acts 19:23\u201341}}). Between 53 and 57&nbsp;AD Paul wrote the letter [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] from Ephesus (possibly from the 'Paul tower' near the harbour, where he was imprisoned for a short time). Later, Paul wrote the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] while he was in prison in Rome (around 62&nbsp;AD).\n\nRoman Asia was associated with [[John the Apostle|John]],<ref name=\"CC\">[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]].

The church at Ephesus had given their support for Ignatius, who was taken to Rome for execution.\n\n[[File:House of the Virgin Mary.jpg|left|thumb|[[House of the Virgin Mary]]]]\nA legend, which was first mentioned by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the 4th century AD, purported that Mary may have spent the last years of her life in Ephesus. The Ephesians derived the argument from John's presence in the city, and Jesus\u2019 instructions to John to take care of Mary after his death. Epiphanius, however, was keen to point out that, while the Bible says John was leaving for Asia, it does not say specifically that Mary went with him. He later stated that she was buried in Jerusalem.<ref>Vasiliki Limberis, 'The Council of Ephesos: The Demise of the See of Ephesos and the Rise of the Cult of the Theotokos' in Helmut Koester, ''Ephesos: Metropolis of Asia'' (2004), 327.</ref> Since the 19th century, The [[House of the Virgin Mary]], about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Sel\u00e7uk, has been considered to have been the last home of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in the Roman Catholic tradition, based on the visions of Sister [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]]. It is a popular place of Catholic pilgrimage which has been visited by three recent popes.\n\nThe [[Church of Mary]] near the harbour of Ephesus was the setting for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] in 431, which resulted in the condemnation of [[Nestorius]]. A [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449, but its controversial acts were never approved by the Catholics.

It has an [[Application programming interface|API]] for working with text, [[Array data type|arrays]], dates, [[regular expression]]s, and basic manipulation of the [[Document Object Model|DOM]], but the language itself does not include any [[Input/output|I/O]], such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.\n\nInitially only implemented [[client-side]] in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including [[server-side]] in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.\n\nAlthough there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], including language name, [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]], and respective [[standard library|standard libraries]], the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as [[Self (programming language)|Self]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = ECMAScript Language Overview\n |url         = http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/overview.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |page        = 4\n |date        = 2007-10-23\n |accessdate  = 2009-05-03\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5rBiWD4P6?url=http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/overview.pdf\n |archivedate = 2010-07-13\n |df          = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Beginnings at Netscape ===\nIn 1993, the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA), a unit of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], released [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]], the first popular graphical [[Web browser]], which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent [[World Wide Web]]. In 1994, a company called [[Netscape|Mosaic Communications]] was founded in [[Mountain View, California]] and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create [[Netscape Navigator|Mosaic Netscape]]. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for \"Mosaic killer\", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world's number one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main browser for the Internet in the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. [[Marc Andreessen]], the founder of the company believed that [[HTML]] needed a \"glue language\" that was easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the Web page markup.\n\nIn 1995, Netscape Communications recruited [[Brendan Eich]] with the goal of embedding the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language into its Netscape Navigator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html|title=Chapter 4. How JavaScript Was Created}}</ref> Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with [[Sun Microsystems]] to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming language [[Java (programming language)|Java]], in order to compete with [[Microsoft]] for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Severance | first=Charles | date=February 2012 | title=JavaScript: Designing a Language in 10 Days | journal=Computer | volume=45 | issue=2 | pages=7\u20138 | publisher=IEEE Computer Society | url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007-abs.html | accessdate=23 March 2013 | doi=10.1109/MC.2012.57 }}</ref> Netscape Communications then decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Tcl|TCL]], or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, in May 1995.\n\nAlthough it was developed under the name '''Mocha''', the language was officially called '''LiveScript''' when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed '''JavaScript'''<ref name=\"press_release\" /> when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.<ref name=\"techvision\">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208124612/http://wp.netscape.com/comprod/columns/techvision/innovators_be.html | archivedate=2008-02-08 | title=TechVision: Innovators of the Net: Brendan Eich and JavaScript | publisher=web.archive.org | url=http://wp.netscape.com/comprod/columns/techvision/innovators_be.html }}</ref> The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized<ref>{{Citation|last=Fin JS|title=Brendan Eich - CEO of Brave|date=2016-06-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmhtfTrRxc&t=2m5s|accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref> as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web programming language.\n\nThere is a common misconception that JavaScript was influenced by an earlier Web page scripting language developed by [[Openwave|Nombas]] named Cmm (not to be confused with the later [[C--]] created in 1997).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly//news/languageposter_0504.html |title=The History of Programming Languages |publisher=O'Reilly Media |date=2004 |website=oreilly.com |access-date=16 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712042618/http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/news/languageposter_0504.html |archive-date=2016-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/88/07645790/0764579088.pdf |title=What Is JavaScript? |publisher=Wiley |website=wiley.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of Cmm before he created LiveScript.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quora.com/Brent-Noorda/answers/ECMA |title=Brent Noorda's Answers on ECMA |last=Noorda |first=Brent |date=21 September 2013 |website=quora.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> Nombas did pitch their embedded Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by the [[ViolaWWW]] Web browser.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brent-noorda.com/nombas/history/HistoryOfNombas.html#h.yal3k216ii2r |title=History of Nombas |last=Noorda |first=Brent |date=24 June 2010 |website=brent-noorda.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of Cmm in their ScriptEase product and was part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module-owner/ |title=New JavaScript Engine Module Owner |last=Eich |first=Brendan |date=21 June 2011 |website=brendaneich.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Server-side JavaScript ===\nIn December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for [[server-side scripting]] with [[Netscape Enterprise Server]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/816-6411-10/contents.htm |title=Server-Side JavaScript Guide |publisher=Netscape Communications Corporation |date=11 December 1998 |website=oracle.com |accessdate=2016-07-16|author=Netscape Communications Corporation}}</ref>\n\nSince 1996, the [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of server-side Javascript -- [[JScript]]\u2014in ASP and .NET pages.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clinick|first1=Andrew|title=Introducing JScript .NET|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974588.aspx|website=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 April 2018|date=July 14, 2000|quote=[S]ince the 1996 introduction of JScript version 1.0 ... we've been seeing a steady increase in the usage of JScript on the server\u2014particularly in Active Server Pages (ASP)}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-2000s, additional [[List of server-side JavaScript implementations|server-side JavaScript]] implementations have been introduced, such as [[Node.js]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://readwrite.com/2009/12/17/server-side_javascript_back_with_a_vengeance/ |title=Server-Side JavaScript, Back with a Vengeance |date=17 December 2009 |website=readwrite.com |accessdate=2016-07-16|author=Mahemoff, Michael}}</ref>\n\n=== Adoption by Microsoft ===\nMicrosoft script technologies including [[VBScript]] and [[JScript]] were released in 1996. JScript, a [[Reverse engineering#Reverse engineering of software|reverse-engineered]] implementation of Netscape's JavaScript, was part of [[Internet Explorer 3]]. JScript was also available for server-side scripting in [[Internet Information Server]]. Internet Explorer 3 also included Microsoft's first support for CSS and various extensions to HTML, but in each case the implementation was noticeably different from that found in Netscape Navigator at the time.<ref name=\"O'Reilly-2001\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/04/06/js_history.html |title=JavaScript, How Did We Get Here? |last=Champeon |first=Steve |date=6 April 2001 |website=oreilly.com |access-date=16 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719020828/http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/04/06/js_history.html |archive-date=2016-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/1996/05/29/microsoft-internet-explorer-3-0-beta-now-available/ |title=Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 Beta Now Available |publisher=Microsoft |date=29 May 1996 |website=microsoft.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> These differences made it difficult for designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers, leading to the use of \"best viewed in Netscape\" and \"best viewed in Internet Explorer\" logos that characterized these early years of the [[browser wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technologizer.com/2010/09/16/the-unwelcome-return-of-best-viewed-with-internet-explorer/ |title=The Unwelcome Return of \"Best Viewed with Internet Explorer\" |last=McCracken |first=Harry |date=16 September 2010 |website=technologizer.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> JavaScript began to acquire a reputation for being one of the roadblocks to a cross-platform and standards-driven Web. Some developers took on the difficult task of trying to make their sites work in both major browsers, but many could not afford the time.<ref name=\"O'Reilly-2001\" /> With the release of [[Internet Explorer 4]], Microsoft introduced the concept of [[Dynamic HTML]], but the differences in language implementations and the different and proprietary [[Document Object Model]]s remained and were obstacles to widespread take-up of JavaScript on the Web.<ref name=\"O'Reilly-2001\" />\n\n=== Standardization ===\nIn November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to [[Ecma International|ECMA International]] to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape. This led to the official release of the language specification [[ECMAScript]] published in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard in June 1997, with JavaScript being the most well known of the implementations. [[ActionScript]] and [[JScript]] were other well-known implementations of [[ECMAScript]].\n\nThe release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 continued the standards process cycle, conforming some modifications to the ISO/IEC 16262 international standard. ECMAScript 3 was released in December 1999 and is the modern-day baseline for JavaScript. The original ECMAScript 4 work led by Waldemar Horwat (then at Netscape, now at [[Google]]) started in 2000. [[Microsoft]] initially participated and implemented some proposals in their [[JScript .NET]] language.\n\nOver time it was clear though that Microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper JavaScript in Internet Explorer, even though they had no competing proposal and they had a partial (and diverged at this point) implementation on the [[.NET]] server side. So by 2003, the original ECMAScript 4 work was mothballed.\n\nThe next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in JavaScript's history. First, Brendan Eich and Mozilla rejoined Ecma International as a not-for-profit member and work started on [[ECMAScript for XML]] (E4X), the ECMA-357 standard, which came from ex-Microsoft employees at [[BEA Systems]] (originally acquired as Crossgain). This led to working jointly with [[Macromedia]] (later acquired by [[Adobe Systems]]), who were implementing E4X in ActionScript 3 (ActionScript 3 was a fork of original ECMAScript 4).\n\nSo, along with Macromedia, work restarted on ECMAScript 4 with the goal of standardizing what was in ActionScript 3. To this end, Adobe Systems released the ActionScript Virtual Machine 2, code named [[Tamarin (software)|Tamarin]], as an [[open source]] project. But Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from web JavaScript to converge, as was realized by the parties in 2007 and 2008.\n\nAlas, there was still turmoil between the various players; [[Douglas Crockford]]\u2014then at [[Yahoo!]]\u2014joined forces with Microsoft in 2007 to oppose ECMAScript 4, which led to the ECMAScript 3.1 effort. The development of ECMAScript 4 was never completed, but that work influenced subsequent versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php|title=Documentation|last=|first=|date=|website=ecmascript.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426141932/http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php|archive-date=2011-04-26|dead-url=|access-date=16 July 2016|quote=development of a Fourth Edition was not completed, that work influenced Fifth Edition}}</ref>\n\nWhile all of this was happening, the open source and developer communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with JavaScript. This community effort was sparked in 2005 when [[Jesse James Garrett]] released a white paper in which he coined the term [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads and leading to more dynamic applications. This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them, with libraries such as [[Prototype JavaScript Framework|Prototype]], [[jQuery]], [[Dojo Toolkit]], [[MooTools]], and others being released.\n\nIn July 2008, the disparate parties on either side came together in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to rename ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5 and drive the language forward using an agenda that is known as Harmony. ECMAScript 5 was finally released in December 2009.\n\nIn June 2011, ECMAScript 5.1 was released to fully align with the third edition of the ISO/IEC 16262 international standard. ECMAScript 2015 was released in June 2015. ECMAScript 2016 was released in June 2016. The current version is ECMAScript 2017, released in June 2017.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Later developments ===\nJavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the Web. However, many professional programmers initially denigrated the language due to the perceived target audience of Web authors and other such \u201camateurs\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html |title=JavaScript, The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language |last=Crockford |first=Douglas |date=2001 |website=crockford.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> The advent of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] returned JavaScript to the spotlight and brought more professional programming attention. The result was a proliferation of comprehensive [[List of JavaScript libraries|frameworks and libraries]], improved JavaScript programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript outside Web browsers, as seen by the proliferation of [[Server-side JavaScript]] platforms.\n\nIn January 2009, the [[CommonJS]] project was founded with the goal of specifying a common standard library mainly for JavaScript development outside the browser.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/12/commonjs-effort-sets-javascript-on-path-for-world-domination.ars |title=CommonJS Effort Sets JavaScript on Path for World Domination |last=Kowal |first=Kris |date=1 December 2009 |website=arstechnica.com |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the rise of [[single-page application]]s and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for [[source-to-source compiler]]s from both [[Dynamic typing|dynamic languages]] and [[Static typing|static languages]].\n\n== Trademark ==\n\"JavaScript\" is a [[trademark]] of [[Oracle Corporation]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title=USPTO Copyright entry #75026640|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=75026640|publisher=USPTO}}</ref> It is used under license for technology invented and implemented by Netscape Communications and current entities such as the [[Mozilla Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Sun Trademarks|url=http://www.sun.com/suntrademarks/|publisher=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=2007-11-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528154600/http://www.sun.com/suntrademarks/|archivedate=28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Vanilla JavaScript ==\nThe terms ''Vanilla JavaScript'' and ''Vanilla JS'' refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vanilla-js.com/|title=Vanilla JS|website=vanilla-js.com|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs#20435744|title=What is VanillaJS?|website=stackoverflow.com|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nThe following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations, unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\n=== Universal support ===\nAll modern Web browsers support JavaScript with built-in interpreters.\n\n=== Imperative and structured ===\nJavaScript supports much of the [[structured programming]] syntax from [[C (computer language)|C]] (e.g., <tt>if</tt> statements, <tt>while</tt> loops, <tt>switch</tt> statements, <tt>do while</tt> loops, etc.). One partial exception is [[scope (computer science)|scoping]]: JavaScript originally had only [[function scoping]] with <tt>var</tt>. ECMAScript 2015 added keywords <tt>let</tt> and <tt>const</tt> for block scoping, meaning JavaScript now has both function and block scoping. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] and [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. One syntactic difference from C is [[Defensive semicolon|automatic semicolon insertion]], which allows the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|p=16}}\n\n=== Dynamic ===\n; Typing:JavaScript is [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] like most other [[scripting language]]s. A [[type system|type]] is associated with a [[value (computer science)|value]] rather than an expression. For example, a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a [[string (computer science)|string]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures|title=JavaScript data types and data structures - JavaScript &#124; MDN|date=2017-02-16|website=Developer.mozilla.org|accessdate=2017-02-24}}</ref>  JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including [[duck typing]].{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|pp=176\u2013178}}\n; Run-time evaluation: JavaScript includes an <tt>[[eval]]</tt> function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\n\n=== Prototype-based (object-oriented) ===\nJavaScript is almost entirely [[object-based]]. In JavaScript, an [[Object (computer science)|object]] is an [[associative array]], augmented with a prototype (see below); each string key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (<tt>obj.x&nbsp;=&nbsp;10</tt>) and bracket notation (<tt>obj['x']&nbsp;=&nbsp;10</tt>). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a <tt>for...in</tt> loop.\n\nJavaScript has a small number of built-in objects, including <tt>Function</tt> and <tt>Date</tt>.\n\n; Prototypes: JavaScript uses [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]] where many other object-oriented languages use [[Class (computer science)|classes]] for [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Inheritance and the prototype chain|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain|work=Mozilla Developer Network|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Effective JavaScript|year=2013|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-321-81218-6|page=83}}</ref>\n; Functions as object constructors: Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with ''new'' will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the <tt>Object</tt> prototype).<ref>{{cite book|last=Haverbeke|first=Marijn|title=Eloquent JavaScript|year=2011|publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=978-1-59327-282-1|pages=95\u201397}}</ref> ECMAScript 5 offers the <tt>Object.create</tt> method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the <tt>Object</tt> prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to <tt>null</tt>).<ref>{{cite web | last=Katz|first=Yehuda|title=Understanding \"Prototypes\" in JavaScript|url=http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> The constructor's <tt>prototype</tt> property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as <tt>Array</tt> or <tt>Object</tt>, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the <tt>Object</tt> prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the <tt>Object</tt> prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Effective JavaScript|year=2013|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-321-81218-6|pages=125\u2013127}}</ref>\n; Functions as methods<!--not sure where to classify this under-->: Unlike many object-oriented languages, there is no distinction between a function definition and a [[method (computer science)|method]] definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling; when a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local ''this'' keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\n\n=== Functional ===\nA [[Subroutine|function]] is [[first-class function|first-class]]; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as <samp>.call()</samp> and <samp>.bind()</samp>.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4-toc | title=Properties of the Function Object | publisher=Es5.github.com | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> A ''nested'' function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a [[Closure (computer programming)|lexical closure]]: The [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping vs. dynamic scoping|lexical scope]] of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.{{Sfn|Flanagan|2006|p=141}} JavaScript also supports [[anonymous function]]s.\n\n=== Delegative ===\nJavaScript supports implicit and explicit [[Delegation (object-oriented programming)|delegation]].\n\n; Functions as roles (Traits and Mixins): JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of [[Role-oriented programming|Role]]<ref>[http://peterseliger.blogspot.de/2014/04/the-many-talents-of-javascript.html#the-many-talents-of-javascript-for-generalizing-role-oriented-programming-approaches-like-traits-and-mixins The many talents of JavaScript for generalizing Role-Oriented Programming approaches like Traits and Mixins], Peterseliger.blogpsot.de, April 11, 2014.</ref> patterns like [[Traits (computer science)|Traits]]<ref>[http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/traitsjs/ Traits for JavaScript], 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cocktailjs.github.io/ |title=Home &#124; CocktailJS |website=Cocktailjs.github.io |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}</ref> and [[Mixin]]s.<ref>Angus Croll, [http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/ A fresh look at JavaScript Mixins], published May 31, 2011.</ref> Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the <tt>this</tt> keyword within its <tt>function</tt> body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via <tt>call</tt> or <tt>apply</tt> to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\n; Object composition and inheritance: Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover [[Object composition|composition]] in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n; Run-time environment:JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment (e.g., a [[Web browser]]) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment (e.g., a webpage [[Document Object Model|DOM]]). It also relies on the run-time environment to provide the ability to include/import scripts (e.g., [[HTML]] <tt><nowiki><script></nowiki></tt> elements). This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations:JavaScript processes [[Message (computer science)|messages]] from a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]] one at a time. JavaScript calls a [[Subroutine|function]] associated with each new message, creating a  [[call stack]] frame with the function's [[Parameter (computer programming)|arguments]] and [[local variable]]s. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the [[event loop]], described as \"run to completion\" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency model]] describes the event loop as [[Asynchronous I/O|non-blocking]]: program [[input/output]] is performed using [[Event (computing)|events]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callback functions]]. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop|title=Concurrency model and Event Loop|website=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=2015-08-28}}</ref>\n\n; Variadic functions<!--note: this is not a functional programming feature-->: An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through [[formal parameter]]s and also through the local <code>arguments</code> object. [[Variadic functions]] can also be created by using the <tt>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind bind]</tt> method.\n\n; Array and object literals: Like many scripting languages, arrays and objects ([[associative arrays]] in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these [[Object literal|literals]] form the basis of the [[JSON]] data format.\n\n; Regular expressions: JavaScript also supports [[regular expression]]s in a manner similar to [[Perl]], which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.<ref>{{cite book | last=Haverbeke | first=Marijn | title=Eloquent JavaScript | year=2011 | publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=978-1-59327-282-1|pages=139\u2013149}}</ref>\n\n=== Vendor-specific extensions ===\nJavaScript is officially managed by [[Mozilla Foundation]], and new language features are added periodically.

Scripts are embedded in or included from [[HTML]] pages and interact with the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) of the page. Some simple examples of this usage are:\n\n* Loading new page content or submitting data to the server via [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] without reloading the page (for example, a social network might allow the user to post status updates without leaving the page).\n* Animation of page elements, fading them in and out, resizing them, moving them, etc.\n* Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video.\n* [[Data validation|Validating]] input values of a [[Form (HTML)|Web form]] to make sure that they are acceptable before being submitted to the server.\n* Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites. Web pages frequently do this for [[Web analytics]], [[ad tracking]], [[personalization]] or other purposes.\n\nJavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server), increasing the application's overall responsiveness to user actions. JavaScript code can also detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as [[Gmail]] take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.\n\nA [[JavaScript engine]] (also known as JavaScript interpreter or JavaScript implementation) is an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that interprets JavaScript [[source code]] and executes the [[computer program|script]] accordingly. The first JavaScript engine was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. The engine, code-named [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey]], is implemented in [[C (programming language)|C]]. It has since been updated (in JavaScript 1.5) to conform to ECMAScript 3. The [[Rhino (JavaScript engine)|Rhino]] engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (formerly at Netscape, now at Google) is a JavaScript implementation in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Rhino, like SpiderMonkey, is ECMAScript 3 compliant.\n\nA Web browser is the most common host environment for JavaScript. A Web browser typically creates \"host objects\" to represent the DOM in JavaScript. The [[Web server]] is another common host environment. A [[Server-side JavaScript|JavaScript Web server]] would typically expose host objects representing [[HTTP]] request and response objects, which a JavaScript program could then interrogate and manipulate to dynamically generate Web pages.\n\nJavaScript is the only language that the most popular browsers share support for and has inadvertently become a [[target language (computing)|target language]] for frameworks in other languages.<ref name=\"computerworld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|last=Hamilton|first=Naomi|date=2008-07-31|publisher=computerworld.com.au}}</ref> The increasing speed of JavaScript engines has made the language a feasible compilation target, despite the performance limitations inherent to its dynamic nature.\n\n=== Example script ===\nBelow is a minimal example of a standards-conforming Web page containing JavaScript (using [[HTML 5]] syntax) and the DOM:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Example</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <button id=\"hellobutton\">Hello</button>\n    <script>\n        document.getElementById('hellobutton').onclick = function() {\n            alert('Hello world!');                     // Show a dialog\n            var myTextNode = document.createTextNode('Some new words.');\n            document.body.appendChild(myTextNode);     // Append \"Some new words\" to the page\n        };\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Compatibility considerations ===\n{{Main|Web interoperability}}\n\nBecause JavaScript runs in widely varying environments, an important part of testing and debugging is to test and verify that the JavaScript works across multiple browsers.\n\nThe DOM interfaces are officially defined by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] in a separate standardization effort. Not all browsers execute JavaScript, as standards between browser implementations differ.\n\nJavaScript authors can deal with these differences by writing standards-compliant code that can be executed correctly by most browsers. Failing that, they can write code that behaves differently in the absence of certain browser features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html|title=Javascript - Object detection|date=|website=Quirksmode.org|accessdate=2017-02-24}}</ref> Authors may also find it practical to detect what browser is running, as two browsers may implement the same feature with differing behavior.<ref>Peter-Paul Koch, [http://www.evolt.org/node/23335 Mission Impossible \u2013 mouse position]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html|title=JavaScript - Browser detect|date=|website=Quirksmode.org|accessdate=2017-02-24}}</ref>  Libraries and toolkits that take browser differences into account are also useful to programmers.\n\nFurthermore, scripts may not work for some users. For example, a user may:\n\n* use an old or rare browser with incomplete or unusual DOM support;\n* use a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or [[mobile phone]] browser that cannot execute JavaScript;\n* have JavaScript execution disabled as a security precaution;\n* use a speech browser due to, for example, a visual disability.\n\nTo support these users, Web authors can try to create pages that [[Fault-tolerant system|degrade gracefully]] on user agents (browsers) that do not support the page's JavaScript. In particular, the page should remain usable albeit without the extra features that the JavaScript would have added. Some sites use the HTML <noscript> tag, which contains alt content if JS is disabled. An alternative approach that many{{Howmany|date=June 2018}} find preferable is to first author content using basic technologies that work in all browsers, then enhance the content for users that have JavaScript enabled.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/|title=Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, And How To Use It?|date=|website=Smashingmagazine.com|accessdate=2018-10-20}}</ref> This is known as [[progressive enhancement]].\n\n== Security ==\n{{See also|Browser security}}\n\nJavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the [[same-origin policy]]: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n\nThere are subsets of general JavaScript\u2014ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)\u2014that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adsafe.org/ | title=Making JavaScript Safe for Advertising | publisher=ADsafe | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/SecureEcmaScript | title=Secure ECMA Script (SES) | publisher=Code.google.com | accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> [[Caja project|Caja]] is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.\n\n[[Content Security Policy]] is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\n\n{{See also|Content Security Policy}}\n\n=== Cross-site vulnerabilities ===\n{{Main|Cross-site scripting|Cross-site request forgery}}\n\nA common JavaScript-related security problem is [[cross-site scripting]] (XSS), a violation of the [[same-origin policy]]. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use ''HTML escaping'' whenever displaying untrusted data.\n\nSome browsers include partial protection against ''reflected'' XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server side can fully prevent XSS.\n\nXSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4392 |title=Mozilla Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability Reported and Fixed - MozillaZine Talkback |website=Mozillazine.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother cross-site vulnerability is [[cross-site request forgery]] (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n\n\"JavaScript hijacking\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a <tt><nowiki><script></nowiki></tt> tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as [[JSON]] or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\n\n* requiring an authentication token in the [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] and [[GET (HTTP)|GET]] parameters for any response that returns private information.\n\n=== Misplaced trust in the client ===\nDevelopers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:\n* Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]], but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.\n* JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.\n* Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript can't be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.<ref>{{cite journal\n |title       = Right-click \"protection\"? Forget about it\n |date        = 2008-06-17\n |url         = http://blog.anta.net/2008/06/17/right-click-%e2%80%9cprotection%e2%80%9d-forget-about-it/\n |issn        = 1797-1993\n |accessdate  = 2008-06-17\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/618GtbF4O?url=http://blog.anta.net/2008/06/17/right-click-%E2%80%9Cprotection%E2%80%9D-forget-about-it/\n |archivedate = 2011-08-22\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n* It is extremely bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.\n\n=== Misplaced trust in developers ===\nPackage management systems such as [[Npm (software)|npm]] and [[Bower (software)|Bower]] are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developer's program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at-least one known vulnerability.<ref name=\"jslibs\">{{cite journal\n | title = Thou Shalt Not Depend on Me: Analysing the Use of Outdated JavaScript Libraries on the Web\n | date = 2016-12-21\n | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/arshad/publications/ndss2017jslibs.pdf\n | accessdate = 2017-02-22 }}</ref> \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\"<ref name=\"jslibs\"/> Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Ko\u00e7ulu removed his repository from [[Npm (software)|npm]].

The free [[Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express]] provides a limited version of the JavaScript debugging functionality in Microsoft Visual Studio. Internet Explorer has included developer tools since version 8.\n\nIn comparison to Internet Explorer, Firefox has a more comprehensive set of developer tools, which include a debugger as well. Old versions of Firefox without these tools used a [[Firefox addon]] called [[Firebug (Firefox extension)|Firebug]], or the older [[Venkman]] debugger. Also, [[WebKit]]'s Web Inspector includes a JavaScript debugger,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://webkit.org/blog/61/introducing-drosera/ | title=Introducing Drosera \u2013 Surfin' Safari | publisher=Webkit.org | date=2006-06-28 | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> which is used in [[Safari (Web browser)|Safari]].

An example is the program [[JSLint]], developed by [[Douglas Crockford]] who has written extensively on the language. JSLint scans JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. Many libraries for JavaScript, such as [[three.js]], provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. They are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as [[Khan Academy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/cs |title=Khan Academy Computer Science|accessdate=28 Sep 2012}}</ref> to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where they can see the output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a Web browser.\n\n== Benchmark tools for developers ==\nJavaScript's increased usage in web development warrants further considerations about performance. [[Front and back ends|Frontend]] code has inherited many responsibilities previously handled by the [[Front and back ends|backend]].

In the same year Microsoft released an implementation for Internet Explorer. This implementation was called [[JScript]] due to trademark issues. In 1997, the first standardized version of the language was released under the name [[ECMAScript]] in the first edition of the ECMA-252 standard.\n\nThe explicit versioning and opt-in of language features was Mozilla-specific and has been removed in later Firefox versions (at least by Firefox 59). Firefox 4 was the last version which referred to an explicit JavaScript version (1.8.5). With new editions of the ECMA-262 standard, JavaScript language features are now often mentioned with their initial definition in the ECMA-262 editions.\n\nThe following table of explicitly versioned JavaScript versions is based on information from multiple sources.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript | title=New in JavaScript |publisher=developer.mozilla.org |date=2014 | accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum91/68.htm | title=JavaScript \u2013 JScript \u2013 ECMAScript version history | publisher=Webmasterworld.com | accessdate=2009-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=John Resig | url=http://ejohn.org/blog/versions-of-javascript | title=Versions of JavaScript | publisher=Ejohn.org | accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

It is true that both have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They also are both typically [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] (when used inside a browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's {{code|lang=javascript|code=Math}} and {{code|lang=javascript|code=Date}} objects are based on classes from Java 1.0,<ref name=\"popularity\">{{cite web | url=http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/ | title=Popularity | author=Brendan Eich | date=3 April 2008 | accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> but the similarities end there.\n\n[[Java (programming language)|Java]] and JavaScript both first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by [[James Gosling]] of Sun Microsystems, and JavaScript by [[Brendan Eich]] of Netscape Communications.\n\nThe differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has [[static typing]], while JavaScript's typing is [[Dynamic typing|dynamic]]. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are [[Class-based programming|class-based]], while JavaScript's are [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].\n\n===WebAssembly===\n\nStarting in 2017, web browsers began supporting [[WebAssembly]], a technology standardized by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]. The WebAssembly standard specifies a binary format, which can be produced by a compiler toolchain such as [[LLVM]], to execute in the browser at near native speed. WebAssembly allows programming languages such as C, C++, C# and Java to be used as well as JavaScript to author client-side code for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2017/11/06/edge-webassembly.aspx|title=Edge Browser Switches WebAssembly to 'On' -- Visual Studio Magazine|website=Visual Studio Magazine}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[WebAssembly]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Bhangal | first=Sham | author2=Jankowski, Tomasz | title=Foundation Web Design: Essential HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PhotoShop, Fireworks, and Flash | year=2003 | publisher=APress L.

It can be a form of [[punishment]] and [[solitude]].<ref Name=\"Hobbes\">{{cite book  |last=Hobbes  |first=Thomas  |title=Leviathan; Or, The Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil  |year=1886  |location= |page=145 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-QtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA145&dq=Exile+can+be+a+form+of+punishment. | doi =  |id=  |publisher=George Routledge and Sons }}</ref>\nIt is common to distinguish between \"internal exile\", i.e., forced resettlement within the country of residence, and \"external exile\", which is [[deportation]] outside the country of residence.<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/internal%2Bexile ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225160912/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/internal%2Bexile |date=February 25, 2016 }}</ref> Although most commonly used to describe an individual situation, the term is also used for groups (especially ethnic or national groups), or for an entire government. Terms such as \"[[diaspora]]\" and \"[[refugee]]\" describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and \"[[government in exile]]\" describes a government of a country that has been forced to relocate and argue its legitimacy from outside that country.\nExile can also be a self-imposed departure from one's homeland. Self-exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution or legal matters (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.\nArticle 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"\n\n==For individuals==\n=== Exiled heads of state ===\n{{main|List of heads of state or government who have been in exile}}\nIn some cases the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[head of state]] is allowed to go into exile following a [[coup]] or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13052996 |title=BBC News - What happens to deposed leaders? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Avoiding tax or legal matters ===\n{{main|Tax exile|Fugitive}}\nA wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a ''tax exile''. Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. Examples include the British-Canadian writer [[Arthur Hailey]], who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels ''Hotel'' and ''Airport'',<ref>Stevie Cameron, ''Blue Trust: The Author, The Lawyer, His Wife, And Her Money,'' 1998</ref> and the English rock band the [[Rolling Stones]] who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called ''Exile on Main Street'', the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera.<ref>Robert Greenfield, ''Exile on Main Street: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones,'' 2008.</ref> In 2012, [[Eduardo Saverin]], one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company's [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kucera|first=Danielle|title=Facebook Co-Founder Saverin Gives Up U.S. Citizenship Before IPO|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/facebook-co-founder-saverin-gives-up-u-s-citizenship-before-ipo.html|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref> The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the [[Ex-PATRIOT Act]], which would have forced such wealthy ''tax exiles'' to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=Drawbaugh|first=Kevin|title=Facebook's Saverin fires back at tax-dodge critics|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/us-facebook-taxes-idUSBRE84G11A20120517|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as [[litigation]] or [[criminal prosecution]]. An example of this is [[Asil Nadir]], who fled to the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] for 17 years rather than face [[prosecution]] in connection with the failed \u00a31.7 bn company [[Polly Peck]] in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n=== Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war ===\nExamples include:\n:* [[Iraq]]i academics asked to return home \"from exile\" to help rebuild Iraq in 2009<ref>{{cite web |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Iraq-Appeals-Anew-to-Exiled/47791 |title=Iraq Appeals Anew to Exiled Academics to Return Home|first=Andrew |last=Mills |website=[[Reuters]] via chronicle.com |date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>\n:* [[Jew]]s who fled persecution from [[Nazi Germany]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/46415/libyan-exile-plan-uks-frozen-assets |title=Libyan exile plan for UK's frozen assets|first=Simon |last=Rocker |website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>\n:* People undertaking a religious or [[civil liberties]] role in society may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution.

According to him, comfortable exile is a \u201csocial exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society.  Such people are considered \u201caliens\u201d or internal \u201cothers\u201d on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture.\u201d <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Balan|first1=Binesh|title=Making of Comfortable Exile through Sanskritization: Reflections on Imagination of Identity Notions in India|journal=Contemporary Voice of Dalit, Sage Pub.|volume=10|issue=10}}</ref>\n\n===Nation in exile===\n{{main|Diaspora|Refugee}}\nWhen a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or \"diaspora\". Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the [[Jew]]s, who were deported by [[Babylon]]ian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BC and again following the destruction of the second [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in AD 70. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.\n\nAfter the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]], [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]]) against the partitioning powers ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]), many Poles have chosen&nbsp;\u2013 or been forced&nbsp;\u2013 to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of [[Crimean Tatars]] (200,000) that remained in their homeland [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[collective punishment]] on false accusations. At [[Diego Garcia]], between 1967 and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed some 2,000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the US and UK.\n\nSince the [[Cuban Revolution]] over one million [[Cubans]] have left [[Cuba]]. Most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. It is to be noted that at the time of the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Cuba]] only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be [[Cuban exile]]s. It is to be noted that under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.\n\n===Government in exile===\n{{main|Government in exile}}\nDuring a foreign [[Military occupation|occupation]] or after a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], a ''government in exile'' of a such afflicted country may be established abroad.  One of the most well-known instances of this is the [[Polish government-in-exile]], a government in exile that commanded [[Polish contribution to World War II|Polish armed forces]] operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the [[Free French Forces]] government of [[Charles De Gaulle]] of the same time, and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].\n\n== In popular culture ==\n===Drama ===\n[[File:Jason and Medea - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jason and Medea]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1907]]\n[[File:Rama vanavas.jpg|thumb|Rama on the way]]\n\nExile is an early motif in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]]. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', written by [[Euripides]] in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of  Greek mythology. Euripides\u2019 [[Medea]] has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.<ref>Cf. Helene P. Foley: ''Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage''. University of California Press, 2012, p. 190</ref>\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Klaus Mann.jpg|thumb|Exiled [[Klaus Mann]] as Staff Sergeant of the 5th US Army, Italy 1944]]\n[[File:Anna Seghers Das siebte Kreuz 1942.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[Anna Seghers]]\u2019 ''[[The Seventh Cross|Das siebte Kreuz]]'']]\n\nAfter [[Medea]] was abandoned by [[Jason]] and had become a murderer out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king [[Aigeus]] there, and became the stepmother of the hero [[Theseus]]. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the [[Polis]] and go away into exile. [[John William Waterhouse]] (1849\u20131917), the English [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter\u2019s famous picture ''[[Jason and Medea]]'' shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.<ref>Cf. Elisabeth Prettejohn: ''Art of the Pre-Raphaelites''. Princeton University Press, London 2000, pp. 165-207. {{ISBN|0-691-07057-1}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\nIn ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet [[Ovid]], who lived during the reign of [[Augustus]]. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work ''Tristia'' (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tristia by Ovid \u2013 high drama and hoax|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/tristia-by-ovid-high-drama-and-hoax|website=theguardian.com}}</ref>\nAnother, at least in a temporary exile, was [[Dante]].\n\nThe German language writer of novels, Franz Kafka, called \"the Dante of the twentieth century\"<ref>Quoted after Harold Bloom: ''Genius. A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds''. Warner Books. New York 2002, p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-446-52717-0}}</ref> by the poet [[W. H. Auden]], describes the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel ''Amerika''.<ref>Cf. an unabridged reading by [[Sven Regener]]: ''Amerika'', Roof Music, Bochum 2014.</ref>\n\nDuring the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors [[Klaus Mann]]  and [[Anna Seghers]]. So Germany\u2019s own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit.<ref>See Martin Mauthner: ''German Writers in French Exile, 1933\u20131940'', Vallentine Mitchell, London 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85303-540-4}}.</ref> Klaus Mann finished his novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Der Vulkan|de}}'' (''The Volcano.

After the defeat of the Teutonic Knights at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and conclusion of the [[Second Peace of Thorn]] in 1466, the city was annexed by Poland.

Its listing is maintained by the [[Narodowy Instytut Dziedzictwa|National Heritage Board of Poland]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Elbl\u0105g'' is the [[Polish language|Polish]] [[Corruption (grammar)|derivative]] of the [[German language|German]] name ''Elbing'', which was assigned by the [[Teutonic Knights]] to the citadel and subsequent town placed by them in 1237 next to the river. The purpose of the citadel was to prevent the [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement of Truso from being reoccupied, as the German crusaders were at exterminatory war with the pagan Prussians. The citadel was named after the river, itself of uncertain etymology. One traditional etymology connects it to the name of the [[Helveconae]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] mentioned in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources, but the etymology or language of the [[tribal name]] remains unknown. The oldest known mention of the river or town Elbing is in the form ''Ylfing'' in the report of a sailor Wulfstan from the end of the 9th century, in ''[[Wikisource:Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader/The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan|The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan]]'' which was written in Anglo-Saxon in [[King Alfred]]'s reign.\n\n== Modern city ==\n[[File:Elbl\u0105g - Brama Targowa.jpg|thumb|Market Gate, Old City]]\n[[File:Elbl\u0105g, uk\u0142ad urbanistyczny Starego Miasta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Panorama of the Old City in Elbl\u0105g]]\n\nElbing was almost completely destroyed at the end of [[World War II]]. The city became the Polish Elbl\u0105g after the war, when the area was ceded to Poland under border changes promulgated at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Parts of the inner city were gradually rebuilt, and around 2000 rebuilding was begun in a style emulating the previous architecture, in many cases over the same foundations and utilizing old bricks and portions of the same walls. The western suburbs of the old city have not been reconstructed.\n\nThe modern city adjoins about half the length of the river between [[Lake Dru\u017cno]] and Elbl\u0105g Bay (''Zatoka Elbl\u0105ska'', an arm of the [[Vistula Lagoon]]), and spreads out on both banks, though mainly on the eastern side. To the east is the Elbl\u0105g Upland (''Wysoczyzna Elbl\u0105ska''), a dome pushed up by glacial compression, 390&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in diameter and {{convert|200|m|2|abbr=on}} high at its greatest elevation.<ref>[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/ice/lec14/lec14.htm#n_poland REGIONAL GLACIATION OF SOUTHERN & EASTERN BALTIC], Emporia State University Lecture #14, by James S. Aber.</ref> It gives the appearance of ridges and parkland.\n\nViews to the west show flat fields extending to the horizon; this part of the Vistula Delta (''\u017bu\u0142awy Wi\u015blane'') is used mainly for agricultural purposes. To the south are the marshes and swamps of Dru\u017cno. The [[Elbl\u0105g River]] has been left in a more natural state through the city, but elsewhere it is a controlled channel with branches. One of them, the Jagiellonski Channel (''Kana\u0142 Jagiello\u0144ski''), leads to the [[Nogat]] River, along which navigation to Gda\u0144sk is common. The [[Elbl\u0105g Canal]] (''Kana\u0142 Elbl\u0105ski'') connecting Lake Dru\u017cno with [[Drw\u0119ca]] River and Lake [[Jeziorak]] is a popular tourist site.\n\nElbl\u0105g is not a deep-water port. The draft of vessels using its waterways must be no greater than {{convert|1.5|m|2|abbr=on}} by law. The turning area at Elbl\u0105g is {{convert|120|m|2|abbr=on}} diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels.<ref>[http://www.polfracht.pl/polfracht/psal/localinf/elb/portelb1.htm Port Elbl\u0105g] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805113641/http://www.polfracht.pl/polfracht/psal/localinf/elb/portelb1.htm |date=August 5, 2006 }}, site maintained by Polfracht Shipping Agency Ltd.</ref> Deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre; in that sense, Elbl\u0105g has become a subsidiary [[port of Gda\u0144sk]]. Traffic of smaller vessels at Elbl\u0105g is within the river and very marginal, while larger vessels cannot reach the open [[Baltic Sea]] because the channel, once built in [[East Prussia|East-Prussia]] to go through the peninsula, has belonged to [[Russia]] since 1945.

After the defeat of the Teutonic Knights and the destruction of the castle by the inhabitants, the city successively came under the sovereignty of the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Polish crown]] (1466), the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1772), and [[Germany]] (1871). Elbing was heavily damaged in [[World War II]], and its German citizens [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|were expelled]] upon the war's end. The city became part of Poland in 1945 and was repopulated with Polish citizens.\n\nThe seaport of '''Truso''' was first mentioned ca. 890 by [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sailor, travelling on the south coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] at the behest of King [[Alfred the Great]] of [[England]]. The exact location of Truso was not known for a long time, as the seashore has significantly changed, but most historians trace the settlement inside or near to modern Elbl\u0105g on Lake [[Dru\u017cno]]. Truso was located at territory already known to the [[Roman Empire]] and earlier.\n\nIt was an important seaport serving the [[Vistula River]] bay on the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] Baltic Sea [[trade route]]s which led from [[Birka]] in the north to the island of [[Gotland]] and to [[Visby]] in the Baltic Sea. From there, traders continued further south to [[Carnuntum]] along the [[Amber Road]]. The ancient Amber Road led further southwest and southeast to the [[Black Sea]] and eventually to [[Asia]]. The east-west trade route went from Truso, along the Baltic Sea to [[Jutland]], and from there inland by river to [[Hedeby]], a large trading center in Jutland. The main goods of Truso were [[amber]], furs, and slaves.\n\nArchaeological finds in 1897 and diggings in the 1920s placed Truso at Gut Hansdorf. A large burial field was also found at Elbing. Recent Polish diggings have found burned beams and ashes and thousand-year-old artifacts in an area of about 20 [[hectares]]. Many of these artifacts are now displayed at the [[Elbing Museum|Muzeum w Elbl\u0105gu]].\n\n=== Prussian Crusade ===\n{{Main|Prussian Crusade}}\n[[File:Elbl\u0105skie kamienice - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Pseudohistory|pseudo-historical]] [[tenements]] and houses in the Old Town]]\n[[File:Gimnazjum nr 5 w Elbl\u0105gu.jpg|thumb|right|A high school building from the 1920s on Agrykola Street]]\n[[File:Elbl\u0105g Warszawska 55 willa nr 644843 fota 7.JPG|thumb|right|Brick manors, built in the [[Neogothic]] style, can be seen in the outer suburbs of Elbl\u0105g]]\n\nAttempts to conquer Prussian land began in 997, when [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], at the urging of the Pope, sent a contingent of soldiers and a missionary ([[Adalbert of Prague]]) to the pagan Prussians, a non-Slavic people, on a crusade of conquest and conversion. The crusade encompassed much of the Baltic Sea coast, including [[Danzig]] (present day Gda\u0144sk), and other areas of the coast up to Sambia. Starting in 1209 additional crusades were called for by [[Konrad I of Masovia|Konrad of Masovia]], who mainly sought to conquer Prussian territory, rather than actually convert the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Prussians. Despite heroic efforts, Old Prussian sovereignty would eventually collapse after a succession of wars instigated by [[Pope Honorius III]] and his frequent calls for crusade.\n\nBefore the Prussians and their neighbors to the west, [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|the Pomeranians]], were finally brought to heel, Polish rulers and the [[Duchy of Masovia]], both by then [[Christianity|Christianised]] peoples, would be continually frustrated in their attempts at northern expansion. Aside from minor border raids, major campaigns against the Prussians would be launched in 1219, 1220, and 1222. After a particularly sound defeat by Prussian forces in 1223, Polish forces in [[Che\u0142mno]], the seat of [[Christian of Oliva]] and the [[Masovia|Duchy of Masovia]], were forced onto the defensive.\n\nIn 1226 Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] summoned the [[Teutonic Knights]] for assistance; by 1230 they had secured [[Che\u0142mno]] (Culm) and begun claiming conquered territories for themselves under the authority of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], although these claims were rejected by the Poles, whose ambition had been to conquer Prussia all along. The Teutonic Order's strategy was to move down the Vistula and secure the delta, establishing a barrier between the Prussians and Danzig. The victorious Teutonic Knights built a castle at Elbing.\n\nThe [[Chronicon terrae Prussiae]]<ref>3.14</ref> describes the conflict in the vicinity of Lake Drusen (now Dru\u017cno) shortly before the founding of Elbing:\n\n:\u2033Omnia propugnacula, que habebant in illo loco, qui dicitur (list) ... circa stagnum Drusine ... occisis et captiis infidelibus, potenter expugnavit, et in cinerem redigendo terre alteri coequavit.\"\n\n:\"All the little redoubts that they had in that place, which are said to be (list) ... and around the Drusine marsh ... he (frater Hermannus magister) assaulted and levelled by rendering them into ash, after the infidels had been killed or captured.\"\n\nTruso did not disappear suddenly to be replaced with the citadel and town of Elbing during the Prussian Crusade. It had already burned down in the tenth century, with the population dispersed in the area.\n\n=== Foundation of Elbing ===\nThe [[Chronicon terrae Prussiae]]<ref>3.15</ref> describes the founding of Elbing under the leadership of [[Hermann Balk]]. After building two ships, the Pilgerim (Pilgrim) and the Vridelant (Friedland), with the assistance of Margrave [[Henry III, Margrave of Meissen|Henry III]] of [[Margraviate of Meissen]], the Teutonic Knights used them to clear the Vistula Lagoon (''Frisches Haff'') and the [[Vistula Spit]] of Prussians:\n:... ''et recens mare purgatum fuit ab insultu infidelium'' ...\n:... \"and the Vistula Spit was purged of the insult of the infidels...\"\n\nApparently the river was in [[Pomesania]], which the knights had just finished clearing, but the bay was in [[Pogesania]]. The first Elbing was placed in Pogesania:\n:''Magister ... venit ad terram Pogesanie, ad insulam illam ... que est in media fluminis Elbingi, in illo loco, ubi Elbingus intrat recens mare et erexit ibi castrum, quod a nomine fluminis Elbingum appellavit, anno dominice incarnacionis MCCXXXVII. Aliqui referunt, quod idem castrum postea ab infidelibus fuerit expugnatum, et tunc ad eum locum, ubi nunc situm est, translatum, et circa ipsum civitas collocata.''<ref>Notes on the passage. [[Medieval Latin]] often used e for ae: Pogesanie for Pogesaniae, que for quae, etc. Recens mare is \"the [[fresh water|fresh-water]] sea\". [[Castrum]] is citadel, not yet of brick.</ref>\n\n:\"The master ... came to the region of Pogesania, to that island which is in the middle of the Elbing river, in that place where the Elbing enters the Vistula Lagoon, and built there a fort, which he called by the name of the Elbing River, in the year of the incarnation of the Lord, 1237. Others report that the same fort was attacked by the infidels and then was moved to the place where it is now situated, and the city gathered around it.\"\n\n[[File:Elbl\u0105g \u015awi\u0119tego Ducha 25.JPG|thumb|right|Holy Ghost Street, ''ulica \u015awi\u0119tego Ducha'', possesses several pre-war examples of social housing]]\n\nBoth landings were amphibious operations conducted from the ships. The ''Chronicon'' relates that they were in use for many years and then were sunk in Lake Drusen. In 1238 the [[Dominican Order]] was invited to build a monastery on a grant of land. Pomesania was not secured, however, and from 1240-1242 the order began building a brick castle on the south side of the settlement. It may be significant that Elbing's first industry was the same as Truso's had been: manufacture of amber and bone artifacts for export. In 1243 [[William of Modena]] created the Diocese of Pomesania and three others. They were at first only ideological constructs, but the tides of time turned them into reality in that same century.\n\nThe foundation of Elbing was perhaps not the end of the Old Prussian story in the region. In 1825 a manuscript listing a vocabulary of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Old Prussian|Old Prussian language]], named the Elbing-Prussian Dictionary ({{lang-de|Elbing-Preu\u00dfisches W\u00f6rterbuch}}), or more commonly in English just Elbing Vocabulary, was found among some manuscripts from a merchant's house. It contained 802 words in a dialect now termed Pomesanian with their equivalents in an early form of German.\n\nThe origin of the vocabulary remains unknown. Its format is like that of modern travel dictionaries; i.e., it may have been used by German speakers to communicate with Old Prussians, but the specific circumstances are only speculative. The manuscript became the Codex Neumannianus. It disappeared after a British [[Strategic bombing|bombing raid]] destroyed the library at Elbing but before then facsimiles had been made. The date of the MSS was estimated at ca. 1400, but it was a copy. There is no evidence concerning the provenance of the original, except that it must have been in Pomesanian.\n\n===Hanseatic Elbing===\n[[File:Siegel Elbing 1350.jpg|thumb|right|Seal of the city of Elbing from 1350, ''Sigillum civitatis Elbingensis'']]\nIn 1246 the town was granted a constitution under [[L\u00fcbeck law]], used in maritime circumstances, instead of [[Magdeburg rights]] common in other cities in [[Central Europe]]. This decision of the Order was in keeping with its general strategy of espousing the [[Industry trade group|trade association]] that in 1358 would become the [[Hanseatic League]]. The Order seized on this association early and used it to establish bases throughout the Baltic. The Order's involvement in the League was somewhat contradictory. In whatever cities they founded the ultimate authority was the commander of the town, who kept office in the citadel, typically used as a prison. L\u00fcbeck law, on the other hand, provided for self-government of the town.\n\nMembership in the Hanseatic League meant having important trading contacts with [[England]], [[Flanders]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The city received numerous merchant privileges from the [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|rulers of England]], Poland, Pomerania, and the Teutonic Order. For instance, the privilege of the Old Town ({{lang-de|Altstadt}}, {{lang-pl|Stare Miasto}}) was upgraded in 1343, while in 1393 it was granted an emporium privilege for grains, metals, and forest products.\n\nExcept for the citadel and churches, Elbing at the time was more of a small village by modern standards. Its area was {{convert|300|x|500|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. It featured a wharf, a marketplace and five streets, as well as a number of churches. The castle was completed in 1251. In 1288 fire destroyed the entire settlement except for the churches, which were of brick. A new circuit wall was started immediately. From 1315 to 1340 Elbl\u0105g was rebuilt. A separate settlement called New Town ({{lang-de|Neustadt}}) was founded ca. 1337 and received [[L\u00fcbeck rights]] in 1347. In 1349 the [[Black Death]] struck the town, toward the end of the European plague. After the population recovered it continued building up the city and in 1364 a [[crane (machine)|crane]] was built for the port.\n\nThe German-language ''Elbinger Rechtsbuch'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&as_brr=0&q=%22Elbinger+Rechtsbuch%22&btnG=Search+Books |title=\"Elbinger Rechtsbuch\" - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}</ref> written in Elbing, Prussia documented among other laws for the first time Polish common law. The German-language Polish laws are based on the [[Sachsenspiegel]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8NYNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA337&dq=elbing+vocabular#PPA337,M1 |title=Archiv f\u00fcr das Studium der neueren ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}</ref> and were written down to aid the judges. It is thus the oldest source for documented Polish [[common law]] and is in Polish referred to as the ''Ksi\u0119ga Elbl\u0105ska'' (Book of Elbl\u0105g<ref>Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie: The Journal of Juristic Papyrology, 1946 [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&as_brr=0&q=%22Book+of+Elbing%22&btnG=Search+Books]</ref>). It was written down in the second half of the 13th century.\n\n===Kingdom of Poland===\n[[File:SM Elbl\u0105g Wigilijna3 (0).jpg|thumb|right|Preserved tenements often resemble [[Amsterdam]] and [[Gda\u0144sk]]]]\nIn 1440 several western and eastern Prussian towns formed the [[Prussian Confederation]], which led the revolt of Prussia against the rule of the Teutonic Knights in 1454. For assistance against the Order, the Confederation asked for help from King [[Casimir IV of Poland]]; Casimir's subsequent claiming of Prussia led to the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\nAfter the Section of Prussians and Polish victory over the Teutonic Order, the city became part of the [[autonomous area|autonomous province]] of [[Royal Prussia]] under the suzerainty of the Polish crown in the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Second Peace of Thorn]]. The city was known to the Polish crown by its Polish name '''Elbl\u0105g'''. With the creation of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, the city was brought under direct control of the Polish crown.\n\nWith the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]] the burghers became [[Protestantism|Lutherans]] and the first Lutheran [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] was established in Elbl\u0105g in 1535.\n\nFrom 1579 Elbing/Elbl\u0105g had close trade relations with [[England]], to which the city accorded [[free trade]]. English, [[Scotland|Scottish]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] merchants settled in the city. They formed the Scottish Reformed Church of Elbl\u0105g and became Elbing citizens, aiding Lutheran [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The rivalry of nearby Danzig interrupted trading links several times. By 1618 Elbl\u0105g had left the Hanseatic League owing to its close business dealings with England.\n\nFamous inhabitants of the city at that time included native sons [[Hans von Bodeck]] and [[Samuel Hartlib]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Swedish Chancellor [[Axel Oxenstierna]] brought the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] refugee [[John Amos Comenius]] to Elbl\u0105g for six years (1642\u20131648). In 1642 [[Johann Stob\u00e4us]], who composed with [[Johann Eccard]], published the '' Preussische Fest-Lieder'', a number of evangelical Prussian songs. In 1646 the city recorder Daniel Barholz noted that the [[city council]] employed ''Bernsteindreher'', or ''Paternostermacher'', licensed and guilded amber craftsmen who worked on [[prayer beads]], [[rosary|rosaries]], and many other items made of amber. Members of the Barholz family became mayors and councillors.\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Vistula Lagoon was the main southern Baltic base of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], who was hailed as the protector of the Protestants. By 1660 the Vistula Lagoon had gone to Elector [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] of [[Brandenburg|Brandenburg-Prussia]], but was returned in 1700.\n\nThe poet [[Christian Wernicke]] was born in 1661 in Elbing, while [[Gottfried Achenwall]] became famous for his teachings in [[natural law]] and [[International human rights law|human rights law]]. In 1700\u20131710 it was occupied by Swedish troops. In 1709 it was besieged, taken by storm on February 2, 1710 by Russian troops with support of Prussian artillery. The city was handed over to [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish King]] Augustus II in 1712.\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] cartographer [[Johann Friedrich Endersch]] completed a map of [[Warmia]] ({{lang-de|Karte des Ermlandes}}) in 1755 and also made a [[copper]] [[etching]] of the galley named \"The City of Elbing\" ({{lang-de|Die Stadt Elbing}}) .\n\nDuring the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1734, Elbing/Elbl\u0105g and Danzig were placed under [[military occupation]] by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Saxony]].<ref>''{{de icon}} Book: Merian-Chronik, C\u00f6ln 1737/8: Elbingische Geschichte Zu gleicher Zeit Danzigs Belagerung 1734...

Traugutta.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Greek-Catholic]] Church of Elbl\u0105g]]\nDuring the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, resulting in the re-unification of Prussia,  the [[City-state|city state]] was annexed by King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Elbing became part of the new Prussian Province of [[West Prussia]] in 1773. In the 1815 provincial reorganization following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Elbing and its hinterland were included within [[Regierungsbezirk Danzig]] in West Prussia.\n\nElbing [[industrialisation|industrialized]] under the sovereignty of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] kings in [[Berlin]]. In 1828 the first steamship was built by Ignatz Grunau. In 1837 [[Ferdinand Schichau]] started the [[Schichau-Werke]] company in Elbing as well as another shipyard in Danzig later on. Schichau constructed the ''Borussia'', the first [[Screw ship|screw-vessel]] in Germany. Schichau-Werke built [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] machinery, ships, [[steam engine]]s, and [[torpedo]]es. After the inauguration of the railway to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in 1853, Elbing's industry began to grow. Schichau worked together with his son-in-law Carl H. Zise, who continued the industrial complex after Schichau's death. Schichau erected large complexes for his many thousands of workers.\n\n[[Georg Steenke]], an engineer from K\u00f6nigsberg, connected Elbing near the Baltic Sea with the southern part of Prussia by building the Oberl\u00e4ndischer Kanal ([[Elbl\u0105g Canal]]).\n\n[[File:Elbl\u0105g Holy Trinity church Kielecka 24-007.JPG|thumb|right|[[Timber-framed]] Holy Trinity Church]]\n\nElbing became part of the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]]. As Elbing became an industrial city, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) frequently received the majority of votes; in the 1912 [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] elections the SPD received 51% of the vote. After [[World War I]], most of West Prussia became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Elbing was joined to German [[East Prussia]], and was separated from [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] by the [[Polish Corridor]].\n\n===Third Reich===\nDuring the Nazi Germany era (1933\u20131945), three subcamps of the [[Stutthof concentration camp]] were located near the town: ''Elbing'', ''Elbing (Org. Todt)'', and ''Elbing (Schinau)''. These were closed and many of the German inhabitants of Elbing forced to flee as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] approached the city toward the end of [[World War II]] (see [[Evacuation of East Prussia]]). Laid under siege since January 23, 1945,about 65% of the city infrastructure<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/ElblC485g/history/background|title=Elbl\u0105g History|author=|date=|website=www.triposo.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref> was destroyed, including most of the historical city center. The town was captured by the Soviet Red Army during the night of February 9/10, 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlesofpoland.com/prusy/elbl_hist_en.htm|title=History of Elblag - Castles of Poland|website=www.castlesofpoland.com|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}</ref> During the first days of the siege most of the population of approximately 100,000 persons fled. After the end of war, in spring 1945, the region together with the town of Elbing became part of [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] as a result of the [[Potsdam Conference]].\n\nAlmost all Germans who remained or returned were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] by the communist regime during the following months. The city was settled with Poles from the [[Eastern Borderlands]], which were annexed by the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n===History after 1945===\nAfter the expulsion of most of the German population, the city was repopulated and given the Polish name ''Elbl\u0105g''. Of the new inhabitants, 98% were [[Poles]] expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]], or Polish peasants from central Poland. Parts of the damaged historical city center were completely demolished, with the bricks being used to rebuild [[Warsaw]] and [[Gda\u0144sk]]. The [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist authorities]] had originally planned that the Old Town, utterly destroyed during the fighting since January 23, 1945, would be built over with [[Tower block|blocks of flats]]; however, economic difficulties thwarted this effort. Two [[church (building)|churches]] were reconstructed and the remaining ruins of the old town were torn down in the 1960s.\n\nAlong with [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] and [[Szczecin]], Elbl\u0105g was the scene of rioting in the coastal cities in 1970 (see also [[Polish 1970 protests]]). Since 1990 the German minority population has had a modest resurgence, with the Elbinger Deutsche Minderheit Organization counting around 450 members in 2000.\n\n[[File:Butelki piwa EB.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Elbrewery|EB]] - [[Beer in Poland|Polish beer]] produced by the Elbrewery Company in Elbl\u0105g]]\nRestoration of the Old Town began after 1989. Since the beginning of the restoration, an extensive archaeological programme has been carried out. Most of the city's heritage was destroyed during the construction of basements in the 19th century or during World War II, but the backyards and [[latrine]]s of the houses remained largely unchanged, and have provided information on the city's history. In some instances, private investors have incorporated parts of preserved stonework into new architecture. By 2006, approximately 75% of the Old Town had been reconstructed. The city museum presents many pieces of art and items of everyday use, including the only 15th century [[binoculars]] preserved in Europe.\n\nElbl\u0105g is home to the [[Elbrewery]], Poland's largest brewery, which belongs to the [[\u017bywiec Brewery|\u017bywiec Group]].\n\n==Historic buildings==\nUntil World War II there were many Gothic, renaissance and baroque houses in Elbl\u0105g's Old Town; some of them are reconstructed. Other preserved buildings are:\n*[[St. Nicholas Cathedral, Elbl\u0105g|St. Nicholas Cathedral]] - a monumental 13th-century Gothic church (cathedral only from 1992, before it was a [[parish church|parochial church]]), destroyed by fire in the late 18th century, then damaged in World War II and repaired\n*city gate (''Brama Targowa'') - erected in 1319\n*St. Mary's Church - former Dominican church, erected in the 13th century, rebuilt in the 14th and 16th centuries; damaged in World War II and reconstructed in 1961 as an [[art museum|art gallery]]; remnants of cloister are partially preserved\n*Holy Ghost church with hospital, from the 14th century\n*Corpus Christi church from the 14th century\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=none\n|1772|11952\n|1781|15768\n|1831|17761\n|1875|33520\n|1880|35842\n|1885|38278\n|1890|41576\n|1900|52518\n|1910|58636\n|1925|67878\n|1933|72409\n|1939|83190\n|1950|48000\n|1970|90000\n|2011|124257\n}}\n\n==Institutions of higher education==\n\n* Elbl\u0105g Higher School of Arts and Economics ({{lang-pl|Elbl\u0105ska Uczelnia Humanistyczno-Ekonomiczna}})<ref>{{cite web |url=http://euhe.edu.pl/ |title=Elbl\u0105ska Uczelnia Humanistyczno-Ekonomiczna |publisher=Euhe.edu.pl |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217111917/http://www.euhe.edu.pl/ |archivedate=December 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n** Faculty of Pedagogy\n** Faculty of Administration\n** Faculty of Health Sciences\n** Faculty of Economics and Politics\n* Elbl\u0105g Higher State College of [[Vocational education|Vocational Education]] (''Pa\u0144stwowa Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Zawodowa'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwsz.elblag.pl/ |title=Pa\u0144stwowa Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Zawodowa w Elbl\u0105gu :: Studia dzienne bezp\u0142atne :: Strona g\u0142\u00f3wna |publisher=Pwsz.elblag.pl |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref>\n** Faculty of Pedagogy and Foreign Languages\n** Faculty of Economics\n** Faculty of Applied Computer Science\n** Faculty of Technical Sciences\n* Bogdan Ja\u0144ski Higher School, Faculty in Elbl\u0105g (''Szko\u0142a Wy\u017csza im.

national-level [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties from across Europe. On 26 March 1976, it was founded in [[Stuttgart]] as a confederation of national political parties under the name '''Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe''' and renamed '''European Liberals and Democrats''' ('''ELD''') in 1977 and '''European Liberal Democrats and Reformists''' ('''ELDR''') in 1986. On 30 April 2004, the ELDR was reformed as an official European party, the '''European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party''' ('''ELDR Party''').<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.eldr.eu/en/press-releases/european-liberal-democrats-change-party-name-alde-party-0|title=European Liberal Democrats change party name to ALDE Party &#124; ALDE Party|publisher=Eldr.eu|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The ALDE Party is affiliated with the [[Liberal International]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liberal-international.org/site/Co-operating_Organsisations.html |title={title} |access-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113022549/http://www.liberal-international.org/site/Co-operating_Organsisations.html |archive-date=13 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and a recognised European political party, incorporated as a non-profit association under [[law of Belgium|Belgian law]].\n\nOn 10 November 2012, the party chose its current name of ALDE Party, taken from its [[European Parliament]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|group]], the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE), which had been formed on 20 July 2004 in conjunction with the [[European Democratic Party]] (EDP). The ALDE parliamentary group is led by [[Guy Verhofstadt]], a former [[Prime Minister of Belgium]]. Prior to the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European election]] the party had been represented through its own group, the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (European Parliament group)|European Liberal Democrats and Reformists]] (ELDR) Group.\n\n{{as of|2018}}, ALDE is represented in European Union institutions, with 68 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and 5 members of the [[European Commission]]. Of the 28 [[member states of the European Union|EU member states]], there are eight with ALDE-affiliated Prime Ministers: [[Mark Rutte]] ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]) in the [[Netherlands]], [[Xavier Bettel]] ([[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|DP]]) in [[Luxembourg]], [[J\u00fcri Ratas]] ([[Estonian Centre Party]]) in [[Estonia]], [[Charles Michel]] ([[Mouvement R\u00e9formateur|MR]]) in [[Belgium]], [[Miro Cerar]] ([[Modern Centre Party|SMC]]) in [[Slovenia]], [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]] ([[Centre Party (Finland)|KESK]]) in [[Finland]], [[Andrej Babi\u0161]] ([[ANO 2011|ANO]]) in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] ([[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]) in [[Denmark]]. Liberals are also in government in three other EU member states: [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Lithuania]].\n\nALDE's think tank is the [[European Liberal Forum]]. The youth wing of ALDE is the [[European Liberal Youth]] (LYMEC), which is predominantly based upon youth and student liberal organisations but contains also a small number of individual members. LYMEC is led by Vedrana Gujic ([[Croatian People's Party \u2013 Liberal Democrats|HNS]], Croatia), who was elected for a two-year term as LYMEC President in May 2014, and counts 200,000 members.\n\n==Structure==\n{{Liberalism sidebar |Organizations}}\n\n===Bureau===\nThe day-to-day management of the ALDE Party is handled by the Bureau, the members of which are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aldeparty.eu/about/structure/bureau |title=Members of the Bureau &#124; ALDE Party |publisher=Aldeparty.eu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Office\n!Name\n!State member\n!Party member\n|-\n|[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|ALDE]] Leader in the [[European Parliament]]\n|[[Guy Verhofstadt]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Belgium]]\n|[[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|OpenVLD]]\n|-\n|ALDE President\n|[[Hans van Baalen]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]\n|{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Netherlands]]\n|[[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]\n|-\n|ALDE Secretary-General\n|[[Jacob Moroza-Rasmussen]] \n|{{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark]]\n|[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]\n|-\n|ALDE Secretary-General<br> of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|Parliamentary Group]]\n| [[Alexander Beels]]\n|{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Netherlands]]\n|[[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]\n|-\n|rowspan=9|ALDE Vice-Presidents\n|[[Luis Garicano]]\n|{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Spain]]\n|[[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Cs]]\n|-\n|[[Timmy Dooley]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]\n|{{Flagicon|Ireland}} [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|[[Fianna F\u00e1il|FF]]\n|-\n|[[Fredrick Federley]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]\n|{{Flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sweden]]\n|[[Centre Party (Sweden)|C]]\n|-\n|[[Ilhan Kyuchyuk]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]\n|{{Flagicon|Bulgaria}} [[Bulgaria]]\n|[[Movement for Rights and Freedoms|DPS]]\n|-\n|[[:de:Markus L\u00f6ning|Markus L\u00f6ning]]\n|{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]\n|-\n|[[Angelika Mlinar]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]\n|{{Flagicon|Austria}} [[Austria]]\n|[[NEOS \u2013 The New Austria|NEOS]]\n|-\n|[[Henrik Bach Mortensen]]\n|{{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark]]\n|[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]\n|-\n|[[Joanna Schmidt]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]\n|{{Flagicon|Poland}} [[Poland]]\n|[[Modern (political party)|Modern]]\n|-\n|[[Annelou van Egmond]]\n|{{Flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Netherlands]]\n|[[Democrats 66]]\n|-\n|ALDE Treasurer\n|[[:sl:Roman Jaki\u010d|Roman Jaki\u010d]]\n|{{flagicon|Slovenia}} [[Slovenia]]\n|[[Alliance of Alenka Bratu\u0161ek|ZSD]]\n|-\n|[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|ALDE in the Council of Europe]] Honorary President\n|[[Anne Brasseur]]\n|{{flagicon|Luxemburg}} [[Luxemburg]]\n|[[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|DP]]\n|-\n|ALDE Leader in the [[European Committee of the Regions]]\n|[[Bart Somers]]\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Belgium]]\n|[[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|OpenVLD]]\n|-\n|President of the [[European Liberal Youth]]\n|[[Sissel Kvist]]\n|{{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark]]\n|[[Radikal Ungdom]]\n|}\n\n== Leaders ==\n* 1978-1979: {{flagicon|France}} [[:fr:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pintat|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pintat]]\n* 1979-1984: {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Martin Bangemann]]\n* 1984-1989: {{flagicon|France}} [[Simone Veil]]\n* 1989-1991: {{flagicon|France}} [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]\n* 1991-1994: {{flagicon|France}} [[Yves Galland]]\n* 1994-1998: {{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Gijs de Vries]]\n* 1998-2002: {{flagicon|Ireland}} [[Pat Cox]]\n* 2002-2009: {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Graham Watson]]\n* 2009\u2013present: {{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Guy Verhofstadt]]\n\n== Presidents ==\n* 1978\u20131981: {{flagicon|Luxembourg}} [[Gaston Thorn]]\n* 1981\u20131985: {{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Willy De Clercq]]\n* 1985\u20131990: {{flagicon|Luxembourg}} [[Colette Flesch]]\n* 1990\u20131995: {{flagicon|Belgium}} Willy De Clercq\n* 1995\u20132000: {{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]]\n* 2000\u20132005: {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Werner Hoyer]]\n* 2005\u20132011: {{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck]]\n* 2011\u20132015: {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Graham Watson]]\n* 2015\u2013present: {{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Hans van Baalen]]\n\n== History of pan-European liberalism ==\n{{main article|History of pan-European liberalism}}\n[[File:ELDR logo.svg|thumb|150px|float|right|ELDR Party logo (2009-2012).]]\n\nPan-European liberalism has a long history dating back to the foundation of Liberal International in April 1947. On 26 March 1976, the Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe was established in [[Stuttgart]]. The founding parties of the federation were the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] of Germany, [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] of France, [[Liberal Party (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] of Denmark, [[Italian Liberal Party]], Dutch [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]] of Luxembourg.<ref name=\"Almeida2012\">{{cite book|author=Dimitri Almeida|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD7bKbo0FYEC&pg=PA102|year=2012|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-34039-0|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> Observer members joining later in 1976 were the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]], French [[Radical Party of the Left]] and [[Independent Republicans]], British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and [[Italian Republican Party]].<ref name=\"Almeida2012\"/> In 1977, the federation was renamed European Liberals and Democrats, in 1986, European Liberal Democrats and Reformists.\n\nIt evolved into the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR Party) in 2004, when it was founded as an official [[European political party|European party]] under that name and incorporated under Belgian law at an extraordinary Congress in Brussels, held on 30 April 2004 the day before the [[enlargement of the European Union]].

However, the European People's Party group in the European Parliament has existed in one form or another since June 1953, from the Common Assembly of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], making it one of the oldest European level political groups. Its size has given it influence in all the EU's institutions. It has been the largest political group in the European Parliament since 1999.

As the European Community expanded into the European Union, the dominant centre-right parties in the new member states were not necessarily Christian democratic, and the EPP ([[European People's Party]], the pan-continental political party founded in 1976 which all group members are now affiliated to) feared being sidelined.<ref name=\"EPPmartens_en\">{{cite web |url=http://epp-ed.europarl.eu.int/Activities/Forum/doc/martens_en.asp |title=\"Shaping Europe \u2013 25 years of the European People\u2019s Party\" by Wilfried Martens, President of the European People's Party |publisher=Epp-ed.europarl.eu.int |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212233218/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eppgroup.eu%2FActivities%2FForum%2Fdoc%2Fmartens_en.asp |archivedate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> To counter this, the EPP expanded its remit to cover the centre-right regardless of tradition and pursued a policy of integrating liberal-conservative parties.<ref name=\"EPPmartens_en\"/>\n\nThis policy led to Greek [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] and Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] MEPs joining the EPP Group.<ref name=\"EPPmartens_en\"/> The British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and Danish [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] tried to maintain a group of their own called the ''European Democrats'' (ED), but lack of support and the problems inherent in maintaining a small group forced ED's collapse in the 1990s, and its members crossed the floor to join the EPP Group.<ref name=\"EPPmartens_en\"/> The parties of these MEPs also became full members of the EPP (with the exception of the British Conservatives who did not join the Party) and this consolidation process of the European centre-right throughout the 1990s with the acquisition of members from the Italian party [[Forza Italia]]. However, the consolidation was not unalloyed and a split emerged with the Eurosceptic MEPs who congregated in a subgroup within the group, also called the ''[[European Democrats]]'' (ED).\n\nNevertheless, the consolidation held through the 1990s, assisted by the group being renamed to the ''European People's Party \u2013 European Democrats'' (EPP-ED) group, and after the [[European Parliament election, 1999|1999 European elections]] the EPP-ED reclaimed its position as the largest group in the Parliament from the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Party of European Socialists]] (PES) group.\n\nSize was not enough, however: the group did not have a majority. It continued therefore to engage in the ''Grand Coalition'' (a coalition with the PES Group, or occasionally the Liberals) to generate the majorities required by the [[cooperation procedure]] under the [[Single European Act]]. This coalition has held, although occasionally the group adopts a government-opposition dynamic with the other groups, notably during the budget crisis when it opposed the PES and brought about the resignation of the Santer Commission.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nMeanwhile, the parties in the European Democrats subgroup [[Movement for European Reform|were growing restless]]<ref name=\"BBC5169268\">{{cite news |last=Mulvey |first=Stephen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5169268.stm |title=article 5169268 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718142135/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5169268.stm |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}</ref> and finally left following the 2009 elections, when the Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] formed their own right-wing [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) group on 22 June 2009, abolishing the European Democrats subgroup from that date.

Those positions are summarised in [[Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament|this article]]. That article characterizes the group as a three-quarter male group that, prior to ED's departure, was only 80% cohesive and split between centre-right Europhiles (the larger EPP subgroup) and right-wing Eurosceptics (the smaller ED subgroup). That article characterized the group as a whole as ambiguous on hypothetical EU taxes, against taxation, Green issues, [[social liberal]] issues ([[LGBT rights]], [[Abortion debate|abortion]], [[euthanasia]]) and full [[Turkish accession]] to the European Union, and for a [[European integration|deeper]] [[Federal Europe]], deregulation, the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and controlling migration into the EU.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|conservatism}}\n* [[European People's Party]]\n* [[Members of the European Parliament 2014-2019]]\n* [[Movement for European Reform]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.eppgroup.eu EPP Group in the European Parliament]\n*[http://www.epp.eu European People's Party (EPP)]\n\n{{European People's Party}}\n{{EuroparlGroup}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:European People's Party (European Parliament Group)}}\n[[Category:European People's Party]]\n[[Category:European People's Party\u2013European Democrats]]\n[[Category:European Parliament party groups]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1953]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1976]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1976 establishments in Europe]]", "sha1": "af1xikm4r26grw6aunqr3hrlhl3j1tb"}}, {"title": "European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left", "ns": "0", "id": "9867", "revision": {"id": "866436168", "parentid": "865080791", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T09:36:58Z", "contributor": {"ip": "137.163.31.146"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox European Parliament group\n|title=European United<br>Left\u2013Nordic Green Left\n|image=GUE-NGL logo.svg\n|imagewidth=123px\n|imagecaption=GUE/NGL logo\n|name=European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left\n|englishabbr=GUE/NGL<ref name=\"t1s1\"/>\n|frenchabbr=GUE/NGL<ref name=\"t1s5\"/><ref name=\"t1s2\"/>\n|formalname=Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left<ref name=\"t1s5\"/><ref name=\"t1s6\"/><ref name=\"t1s40\"/>\n|ideology=[[Democratic socialism]] (majority)<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu.html|title=European Union|website=Parties and Elections in Europe|last=Nordsieck|first=Wolfram|year=2015|accessdate=22 September 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608032858/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu.html|archivedate=8 June 2017}}</ref><br>[[Communism]] (minority)<ref name=\":0\"/><br>[[Soft Euroscepticism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28107633|title=How Eurosceptic is the new European Parliament?|date=1 July 2014|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n|europarties=[[Party of the European Left]]<br>[[European Anti-Capitalist Left]]\n|associated=[[Nordic Green Left Alliance]]\n|from={{start date and age|1995|1|6|df=yes}}<ref name=\"t1s4\"/>\n|precededby=[[European United Left (1994\u201395)|European United Left]]\n|chairs={{nowrap|[[Alonso Jos\u00e9 Puerta]] (1999\u20132004)<ref name=\"t1s40\"/><br>[[Francis Wurtz]] (2004\u20132009)<br>[[Lothar Bisky]] (2009\u20132012)<br>[[Gabriele Zimmer]] (2012\u2013present)}}\n|meps={{composition bar|51|751|hex={{European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left/meta/color}}}}\n|website={{url|guengl.eu}}\n}}\n'''European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left''' ({{lang-fr|Gauche unitaire europ\u00e9enne}}, '''GUE/NGL''') is a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group]] in the [[European Parliament]] established in 1995.<ref name=\"Staab2011\">{{cite book|author=Andreas Staab|title=The European Union Explained, Second Edition: Institutions, Actors, Global Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gePMlsVzZI0C&pg=PA67|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00164-1|page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe group comprises political parties of [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Communism|communist]] orientation.<ref name=\"Trechsel2013\">{{cite book|author=Alexander H.

The Nordic Green Left (NGL) merged with the [[European United Left (1994\u201395)|Confederal Group of the European United Left]] (GUE) on 6 January 1995,<ref name=\"t1s4\"/> forming the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.<ref name=\"t1s5\"/><ref name=\"t1s6\"/><ref name=\"t1s40\"/> The NGL suffix was added to the name of the expanded group on insistence of Swedish and Finnish MEPs.<ref name=\"RaunioTiilikainen2013\">{{cite book|author1=Tapio Raunio|author2=Teija Tiilikainen|title=Finland in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzkF4lCzIJ4C&pg=PA59|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-76204-9|page=59}}</ref> The group initially consisted of MEPs from the Finnish [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], the Swedish [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], the Danish [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left of Spain]] (including the [[Communist Party of Spain|Spanish Communist Party]]), the [[Synaspismos]] of Greece, the [[French Communist Party]], the [[Portuguese Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] of Italy.\n\nIn 1999, the German [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) and the Greek [[Democratic Social Movement]] (DIKKI) joined as full members while the five MEPs elected from the list of the French Trotskyist alliance [[Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re|LO]]\u2013[[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|LCR]] joined as associate members.\n\nIn 2002, four MEPs from the French [[Citizen and Republican Movement]] also joined the group.\n\nIn 2004, no MEPs were elected from LO\u2013LCR and DIKKI\u2014which was undergoing a dispute with its leader over the party constitution\u2014did not put forward candidates. MEPs from the Portuguese [[Left Bloc]], the borth Irish and Northern Irish [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], the [[Progressive Party of Working People]] of Cyprus and the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] joined the group.\n\n== Position ==\nAccording to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present [[European Union]] political structure, but it is committed to integration.<ref name=\"EULNGLConDec\"/> That declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another European Union, namely the total change of institutions to make them fully democratic, breaking with neo-liberal monetarist policies, and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. The group wants to disband the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and strengthen the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).\n\nThe group is ambiguous between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve these aims. As such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as insiders within the European institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision; and as outsiders by its willingness to seek another Europe which would abolish the [[Maastricht Treaty]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe GUE/NGL is a confederal group who is composed of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from national parties. Those national parties must share common political objectives with the group as specified in the group's constituent declaration. Nevertheless, those national parties and not the group retain control of their MEPs, therefore the group may be divided on certain issues.\n\nMembers of the group meet regularly to prepare for meetings, debate on policies and vote on resolutions. The group also publishes reports on various topics.\n\n=== Member parties ===\nMEPs may be full or associate members.\n* Full members must accept the constitutional declaration of the group.\n* Associate members need not fully do so, but they may sit with the full members.\n\nNational parties may be full or associate members.\n* Full member parties must accept the constitutional declaration of the group.\n* Associate member parties may include parties that do not have MEPs (e.g. French Trotskyist parties which did not get elected in the 2004 European elections), are from states that are not part of the European Union, or do not wish to be full members.\n\n== Member parties ==\n[[File:GUE NGL after 2014 elections.png|thumb|250px|Member states with one MEP in GUE/NGL are in pink while

It was a political group in the [[European Parliament]] from 1979 until 1992, when it became a subgroup of the [[European People's Party Group|European People's Party\u2013European Democrats]] (EPP-ED) group. The European Democrats continued to exist as a political group in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) until 2014, when it became the [[European Conservatives Group]].\n\n==European Democrats in the European Parliament==\n\n===1979-1992===\nThe [[European Democratic Group]]<ref name=\"t1s3\"/><ref name=\"t1s49\"/> (ED) was formed on 17 July 1979<ref name=\"t1s7\"/> by British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Danish [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] and other MEPs after their success in the [[European Parliament election, 1979|1979 elections]]. It supplanted the earlier [[European Conservative Group]].\n\nIn the late seventies and early eighties, the ED was the third-largest [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group in the European Parliament]].\n\nHowever, the group saw its membership fall sharply in the late 1980s, as many [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] members moved to the rival [[European People's Party]] (EPP), dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU), Italian [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] and the ideology of [[Christian democracy]] in general. The ED had been somewhat further from the [[Centrism|political centre]] and less [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] than the EPP. Largely isolated, even hardline [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]]s like [[Margaret Thatcher]] conceded that the British Conservatives could not be effectively heard from such a peripheral group.\n\n===1992-1999===\nOn 1 May 1992,<ref name=\"t1s7\"/> the ED (now largely composed of UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] members) dissolved, and its remaining members were accorded \"associated party\" status in the [[European People's Party Group]]; that is, being part of the parliamentary group without retaining actual membership in the EPP [[European political party|Europarty]] organisation. This was considered essential for the Conservatives, as the EPP was generally seen as quite favourable to European integration, a stance at odds with their core ideology. The Conservatives' relationship to the EPP would become a sore point in the following years, particularly for the eurosceptic general membership in Britain. Then-leader of the British Conservative Party [[William Hague]] hoped to put the issue to rest by negotiating a new arrangement in 1999 by which the EPP's parliamentary group would rebrand itself as the [[European People's Party Group|European People's Party\u2013European Democrats]] (EPP-ED), with the \"European Democrat\" nomenclature returning after a seven-year hiatus.  This was intended to nominally underscore the Conservatives' status apart from the rest of EPP, and it was hoped that with the coming [[enlargement of the European Union]] numerous newly involved [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties, averse to the EPP proper for its perceived [[Federal Europe|European federalism]], would be willing to instead enter the ED subgroup, growing the overall alignment.\n\n===1999-2009===\nThe arrangement proved to do little to appease opposition. Hague's successor, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], made a concerted drive at one point to resurrect the European Democratic Group, but backed off when it became clear that Conservative MEPs would not move voluntarily. The hope that multiple Central and European parties would join ED also proved to be dubious, as only the Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] took up the offer, with the remainder joining EPP proper or other groups such as [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] (UEN) or [[Independence and Democracy]] (IND/DEM). Meanwhile, the ED remained a more [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] subgroup within the broader EPP-ED bloc that contributed slightly more than 10% of its total MEPs.  It resisted the trend of incorporating as a [[European political party]].\n\nDuring the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|2005 Conservative leadership contest]], eventual winner [[David Cameron]] pledged to withdraw the Conservatives from the EPP-ED group, while opponent [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] argued in a letter to the editor of the [[Daily Telegraph]] that the current ED arrangement allowed the Conservatives to maintain suitable distance from EPP while still having influence in the largest parliamentary grouping.  Conservative/EPP-ED MEP [[Martin Callanan]] responded in that paper the following day:\n{{quote|SIR - David Davis (Letter, November 10) is sadly misinformed about our Conservative MEPs' relationship with the European People's Party (EPP) in the European Parliament. He claims that \"Conservatives are members of the European Democrat group, which forms an alliance with the EPP\". In reality, though, the ED does not exist. It has no staff or money and is, in effect, a discussion group within the EPP. [\u2026] Far from being a symbolic step, as Mr Davis suggests, leaving the EPP is the one hard, bankable commitment to have come out of this leadership campaign.<ref name=\"callanan\">{{cite web|last1=Callanan|first1=Martin|title=Daily Telegraph letters|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3620966/Daily-Telegraph-letters.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 February 2016|date=11 November 2005}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS), the [[Law and Justice]] (PiS) of Poland and the [[Rally For France]] party were among the first to discuss forming a breakaway group under the [[Movement for European Reform]]. [[Reg Empey|Sir Reg Empey]], Leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) has committed his party thereunto<ref>[http://www.uup.org/newsrooms/speeches/text-of-a-speech-by-sir-reg-empey-to-the-agm-of-the-ulster-unionist-council-on-saturday-may-31-2008-.php Leader's speech 2008]</ref>  Its position would be that the [[European Union]] should exist, but as a looser supranational organisation than at present, making the group less eurosceptic than the UEN and IND/DEM groups. Some members from the above parties founded a new organization, the [[Alliance for an Open Europe]], in the midst of this debate, with broadly similar objectives.\n\nCameron initially intended to form the new group in 2006, though this aspiration had to be cancelled due to their main prospective partners, the ODS and PiS, being unable or unwilling to break away from their then-groupings; the new grouping was put on hiatus until the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European elections]]. By then, new factors&mdash;including the collapse of the UEN group&mdash;made conditions for forming a new political grouping much more favourable. On 22 June 2009, the founder members of the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) group, all signatories of the Prague Declaration announced that they were to leave the EPP-ED, and in virtue of that fact, the European Democrats movement. This announcement ended the 30-year existence of the European Democrats in the European Parliament.\n\n===Former member parties===\nThe following political parties were associated with the European Democrats at some point:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.|{{bibleref2|Ephesians|4:1\u20133}}}}\n\nThe Church is to maintain the unity in practice which Christ has brought about positionally. According to New Testament scholar Daniel Wallace, the theme may be stated pragmatically as \"Christians, get along with each other! Maintain the unity practically which Christ has effected positionally by his death.\"<ref name=Wallace>Wallace, Daniel B. \"Ephesians:Introduction, Argument, and Outline.\" Web: [http://bible.org/seriespage/ephesians-introduction-argument-and-outline] 1 January 2010</ref>\n\nAnother major theme in Ephesians is the keeping of Christ's body (that is, the Church) pure and holy. \n{{quote|Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.|{{bibleref2|Ephesians|5:1\u20132}}}}\n\nIn the second part of the letter, Ephesians 4:17\u20136:20, the author gives practical advice in how to live a holy, pure, and Christ-inspired lifestyle. Many devotional thoughts and sermons that are addressed to the practically minded-individual have been drawn from this section of the New Testament.{{Citation needed|reason=Examples needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to tradition, the Apostle Paul wrote the letter while he was in prison in [[Rome]] (around AD 62). This would be about the same time as the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] (which in many points it resembles) and the [[Epistle to Philemon]]. However, many critical scholars have questioned the authorship of the letter and suggest that it may have been written between AD 80 and 100.<ref name=\"Ehrman 2004 381\u2013384\"/><ref name=\"nccbuscc.org\"/><ref name=barth/>\n\n===Authorship===\n{{Main article|Authorship of the Pauline Epistles}}\nThe first verse in the letter identifies Paul as its author.

Sanders|Sanders]], Schille, [[Brooke Foss Westcott]], and [[Theodor Zahn]].<ref name=\"Ephesians\"/> For a defense of the Pauline authorship of  Ephesians, see ''Ephesians: An Exegetical Commentary'' by [[Harold Hoehner]], pp 2\u201361.<ref name=\"Hoehner 2002\"/>\n* A second position suggests that Ephesians was dictated by Paul with interpolations from another author. Some of the scholars that espouse this view include Albertz, Benoit, Cerfaux, Goguel, Harrison, [[H. J. Holtzmann]], [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor|Murphy-O'Connor]], and Wagenfuhrer.\n* Currently, most [[biblical criticism|critical scholars]] think it improbable that Paul authored Ephesians. Among this group are Allan, Beare, Brandon, Bultmann, Conzelmann, [[Martin Dibelius|Dibelius]], Goodspeed, Kilsemann, J. Knox, W.L. Knox, K\u00fcmmel, K and S Lake, Marxsen, Masson, Mitton, Moffatt, [[Dennis Nineham|Nineham]], Pokorny, Schweizer, and J. Weiss.\n* Still other scholars suggest there is a lack of conclusive evidence. Some of this group are Cadbury, Julicher, McNeile, and Williams.\n\n===Place, date, and purpose of the writing of the letter===\nWhile most English translations indicate that the letter was addressed to \"the saints who are in [[Ephesus]]\" (1:1), the words \"in Ephesus\" do not appear in the best and earliest manuscripts of the letter, leading most [[Textual criticism|textual critics]], like [[Bart Ehrman]], to regard the words as an [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].<ref name=\"Ehrman 2004 381\u2013384\"/> This lack of any internal references to [[Ephesus]] in the early manuscripts may have led [[Marcion]], a second-century [[heresiarch]] [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|who created the first New Testament canon]], to believe that the letter was actually addressed to the church at [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], for details see [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].<ref name=\"Bruce142\"/> The view is not uncommon in later traditions either,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} considering that the content of the letter seems to suggest a similar socio-critical context to the Laodicean church mentioned in the [[Revelation of John]].\n\nFurthermore, if Paul is regarded as the author, the impersonal character of the letter, which lacks personal greetings or any indication that the author has personal knowledge of his recipients, is incongruous with the account in Acts of Paul staying more than two years in Ephesus.<ref name=\"OBrien5\">{{cite book |last=O'Brien |first=Peter T. |author-link=Peter O'Brien (theologian) |date=1999 |title=The Letter to the Ephesians |publisher=Eerdmans |place=Grand Rapids, Michigan |series=The Pillar New Testament Commentary |isbn=978-0802837363 |editor-last=Carson |editor-first=D.

However, scholars who dispute Paul's authorship date the letter to between 70\u201380 AD.<ref name=\"barth\" /> In the latter case, the possible location of the authorship could have been within the church of Ephesus itself. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] himself seemed to be very well versed in the epistle to the Ephesians, and mirrors many of his own thoughts in his own epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=\"barth\">See Markus Barth, Ephesians: Introduction, Translation, and Commentary on Chapters 1\u20133 (New York: Doubleday and Company Inc., 1974), 50\u201351</ref>\n\nThe major theme of the letter is the unity and reconciliation of the whole of creation through the agency of the Church and, in particular, its foundation in Christ as part of the will of the Father.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn the [[Epistle to the Romans]], the author writes from the point of view of the demonstration of the [[righteousness]] of God\u2014his covenant faithfulness and saving justice\u2014in the gospel; the author of Ephesians writes from the perspective of union with Christ, who is the head of the true church.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Outline==\nEphesians contains:\n* '''{{Bibleref2-nb|Eph.|1:1,2}}.'''

The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by [[Apollos]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ac.|18:24\u201326}} and [[Aquila (bible)|Aquila]] and [[Priscilla (Christian)|Priscilla]]. On his second visit early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus \"three years\", for he found it was the key to the western provinces of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. Here \"a great door and effectual\" was opened to him,{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|16:9||1 Cor 16:9}} and the church was established and strengthened by his diligent labours there.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:20,31}} From Ephesus the gospel spread abroad \"almost throughout all Asia.\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|19:26}} The word \"mightily grew and prevailed\" despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.\n\nOn his last journey to [[Jerusalem]], the apostle landed at [[Miletus]] and, summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them a farewell charge,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|20:18\u201335}} expecting to see them no more.\n\nThe following parallels between this epistle and the Milesian charge may be traced:\n\n# {{Bibleref2|Acts|20:19}} = {{Bibleref2|Eph.|4:2}}.

Originating in the circumstance of a [[multicultural]] church (primarily [[Jewish]] and [[Hellenistic]]), the author addressed issues appropriate to the diverse religious and cultural backgrounds present in the community.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Ein Herr Ein Glaube Eine Taufe.jpg|thumb|220px|right|German inscription of the text, \"One Lord, One faith, One baptism,\" (Ephesians 4:5).]]\n\nThe author exhorts the church repeatedly to embrace a specific view of salvation, which he then explicates. It seems most likely that the author's Christology of sacrifice is the manner in which he intends to effect an environment of peace within the church. In short: \"If Christ was sacrificed for your sake, be like him and be in submission to one another.\" The author addresses hostility, division, and self-interest more than any other topic in the letter, leading many scholars{{Who|date=October 2016}} to believe that his primary concern was not doctrinal, but behavioral.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nSome theologians, such as Frank Charles Thompson,<ref>Thompson, Frank C. ''Thompson Chain Reference Study Bible (NIV).'' Kirkbride Bible Company, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-88707-009-9}}</ref> agree the main theme of Ephesians is in response to the newly converted Jews who often separated themselves from their Gentile brethren. The unity of the church, especially between Jew and Gentile believers, is the keynote of the book. This is shown by the recurrence of such words and phrases as:\n\n'''Together:''' made alive together;{{Bibleref2c|Eph|2:5}} raised up together, sitting together;{{Bibleref2-nb|Eph.|2:6}} built together.{{Bibleref2-nb|Eph.|2:22}}\n\n'''One''', indicating unity: one new man,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|2:15}} one body,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph|2:16}} one Spirit,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph|2:18}} one hope,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph|4:4}} one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph|4:5\u20136}}\n\nThe Pauline theme of unity based on a sacrificial Christology may also be noted in the epistle to the [[Philippians]].\n\n==Interpretations==\nEphesians is notable for its domestic code treatment in {{bibleref2-nb|Ephesians|5:22\u20136:9}}, covering husband-wife, parent-child, and master-slave relationships. In {{bibleref2-nb|Ephesians|5:22}}, wives are urged to submit to their husbands, and husbands to love their wives \"as Christ loved the Church.\" [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarian theologians]], such as [[Katharine Bushnell]] and Jessie Penn-Lewis, interpret these commands in the context of the preceding verse, {{bibleref2-nb|Ephesians|5:21}} for all Christians to \"submit to one another.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bushnell |first=Katharine |title=Dr. Katharine C.
